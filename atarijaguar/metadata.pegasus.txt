	AirCars takes place in the future after a nuclear holocaust.\n
	The large organization E.B.N.E.R.S. is plotting to take over the world and has developed advanced forcefield and teleportation systems, and nuclear powered AirCars. To stop the plot, your group steals plans, builds its own AirCar, and sets out to destroy all of the bases, 28 known and countless unknown ones, stationed around the globe.
	.
	You can choose to play a single player game, the 2-player game using a JagLink, or up to 8 players using ICD's CatBoxes. On screen and on radar, each player's AirCar is displayed in a different color to help identify the good guys from the bad guys. There are 3 difficulty settings. You will be using the cockpit's instrument panel to fly the AirCar, select weapons and view radar, as well as combating the enemy in the air and shooting ground targets.
	.
	Features include true 3D sound, a computer voice (which can be turned off if desired), and music during the introduction and level intermissions.

	The Jaguar version of Alien vs. Predator is completely different from the Arcade and SNES games of the same name.
	.
	The Jaguar version takes place entirely on a Colonial Marine Training base.  A ship infested with Aliens is found floating near the outer-space training facility.  Of course, once the Aliens get inside the base, they kill off nearly everyone.  Meanwhile, the Predators dock their ship on the training base as well.  They see this as an opportunity to catch an Alien Queen, and bring honor to their clan.
	.
	So there are three scenarios in which to play:  First, you can play as a Marine. Your job is to find a way to self-destruct the base, and make your way to an escape pod before it blows.  The second scenario allows you to play as an Alien.  Here, your job is to find and protect the Queen from the Marines and the Predators.  Finally, you can play as the Predator.  The Predator must simply find and kill the Alien Queen.
	.
	The game plays like a first person shooter.  The play field consists of the 5 levels of the training base, plus areas for the Predator and Alien ships.  All the areas of the ship are inter-connected, giving the game a huge virtual environment.  Depending on the scenario you choose, you will have to choose different strategies based on the capabilities of your character.  For example, the Marine will have to make use of his weapons and his ability to use the ship's computer terminals.  The Aliens, on the other hand, will have to make use of their great numbers and ability to cocoon their enemies.  And finally the Predator must fight with honor, and not over-use his invisibility capability.

	Atari Karts is a character-based go-kart racing game. It plays very similarly to Super Mario Kart. The emphasis in this game, like most kart games, is on making use of pick-up items found around the track to knock out your opponents.
	.
	There is only one game mode, a points based cup series.  There are four difficulty levels, each with 3 cups to race for. After completing all the cups for a difficulty level, you get to challenge a "boss" kart in a single race match.  If you beat the boss, he becomes a playable character.  The various cup races can be played in either single player or two player split screen modes.

	In the distant galaxy of Bleurggh, an evil (but reasonably stupid) band of aliens picked up some of Earth's television signals. Unfortunately for them, they could only tune in a wildlife program. They figured the Earth would be a pushover to invade, so they disguised themselves as its inhabitants -- penguins! Word of the invasion has reached those champions of intergalactic do-goodery, Bernard and Rodney. Now, with their help, you must prevent the alien mutant penguins from triggering the Doomscale and destroying the Earth. Are you up to the challenge?

	Breakout 2000 is the Jaguar update to Atari's classic arcade game, Breakout. The premise in Breakout is to bounce a ball off a paddle into a series of blocks that disappear when struck. While the original Breakout, which is included with this release, has simple rectangles that represent the ball and paddle, Breakout 2000 has flashy pre-rendered 3D graphics.
	.
	There are also a couple of gameplay enhancements over basic Breakout.  First, the game can be played with two players.  The second player has their own playfield at the top of the screen.  They also have their own set of blocks to demolish, and can send their ball to the bottom playfield for the other player to hit.  You can set either player to be computer controlled, so you can even watch the computer play against itself if you want.  The other enhancement are the various power-ups that allow you to shoot the blocks out directly, catch the ball, and so on.

	Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).
	.
	Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.

	Cybermorph was the first game released for Atari's Jaguar console. It's a 3d sci-fi shoot-'em-up.  The story goes like this:  The evil Pernitia Empire is swallowing up the galaxy's planets left and right.  What's worse, the resistance forces have had their secret weapons stolen from them and put into pods spread out on many different planets.  You must pilot the T-Griffon morphing attack craft to each planet and recover the pods to stop the Pernitians.
	.
	So, in each planet, or level, you must collect a certain number of pods and make it to the exit before the enemies shoot you down. Fortunately, there are power-ups that can strategically enhance the T-Griffon's offensive capabilities.  After clearing 8 planets, you take on a boss creature/ship before moving on to the next sector.  There are 4 levels like this to clear, each with progressively increasing difficulty.

	Defender 2000 is an update of the classic arcade game by Eugene Jarvis.  This Jaguar game features a port of the original game, and two updated versions: Defender Plus and Defender 2000.
	.
	Defender combines a side scrolling shooter with a search and rescue game. You control a ship that travels left and right above the planets surface. Alien lander craft warp into the play area, and begin to descend to the surface. Along the surface, there are humanoids ripe for the picking.  The alien landers grab the humanoids and begin to carry them up the screen. You have to shoot the landers before they reach the top of the screen, and catch the humanoids before they fall to the surface.
	.
	The Defender Plus update features gameplay that is very similar to the original, and graphics that have a crazy, psychedelic look. The Defender 2000 update adds playfields that scroll in both directions, weapon power-ups, bonus rounds, improved graphics, and extremely high speed gameplay.

description:
	The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.
	.
	id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.
	.
	The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be
	pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.
	.
	DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.
	.
	Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.
	.
	DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.
	.
	DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.
	.
	The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.
	.
	DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in
	a random location after being killed.

	You can select a fast, medium, or heavy tank at the beginning of the game, with its abilities reflected in the strength of its guns or the amount of punishment it can absorb. Throughout the game, you will also find weapon power-ups and tank upgrades (such as shields, radar, and auto-targeting) to help you stay effective against the increasing numbers of enemy defenders. You can save your progress to the cart at the end of each level.
	.
	Between levels are bonus rounds where you pilot your tank through a corridor and try to collect a set percentage of data pods. Meeting that percentage earns you an extra life.

	Missile Command 3D is an update to the classic Atari arcade game. The goal in Missile Command is to defend your cities against an onslaught of missiles coming from the sky. Your arsenal consists of three anti-missile flak cannons. You have to position the anti-missile clouds in the path of the incoming missiles to stop them from impacting.
	.
	This Jaguar game has 3 modes. First, there is a port of the original arcade game. There are neat extras for this mode like graphic backdrops and the ability to resize or scale the screen. The second mode is Missile Command 3D. This mode retains the gameplay of the original, but adds 3D graphics to the mix. The final mode, Virtual Missile Command, changes things up quite a lot. Instead of anti-missile flak, your cannons shoot lasers. This means you don't need to lead your targets anymore. You play the game from a first-person perspective, and must switch between the three cannons via buttons on the keypad. There are nine levels in this mode, each with a boss at the end.

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.
	.
	Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
	.
	You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.
	.
	It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

	Civilization has fallen into a deep decline.  Gangs and warlords are gaining power and influence all over the world.  Then out of nowhere, a powerful being known as the Gaurdian appears with a challenge.  Unless a warrior meets his challenge, he will destroy the Earth.  So, 7 warriors from around the world fight to re-open the Ultra Vortek and restore the Earth.
	.
	Ultra Vortek is a one-on-one fighting game similar to Mortal Kombat.  Some of the fighters are digitzed actors, other are stop motion or computer animated.

	This is the game of basketball the way many people learn to play it - in the city streets - with loose rules and in various suburban locales. Inspired by the 1992 film about high stakes street basketball gambling, in this game you can wager how much you want on each game.
	.
	The action is seen from the half court line, with a screen view that pans and zooms to follow the action. Aside from a goal tending penalty and the need to clear the ball, anything goes. For instance, steals are effected by shoving an opponent and making a grab for the ball.
	.
	Your goal is to get enough money to enter, and win, the tournament. If you make $5000, you instantly get entered into the tournament. You have the ability to save your game in this mode so that you can come back later if you run short on time and don't want to lose all your money.
	.
	Opt for a single game or the Slam City tournament, while game options determine time limits, scoring system, and control schemes. There are fifteen teams to choose from, and up to four players can get in on the action (with the Jaguar Team Tap adapter included with the game).

	id software's adaptation of their classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to consoles is not a straight port, but a remix with substantial changes as well as new additions.
	.
	While the basic gameplay of exploring levels, shooting enemies, collecting treasures, keys and power-ups remain the same, only half of the original game's 60 levels have been retained. Each of those 30 levels (grouped into six missions, with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified version of an original level. The end bosses for the missions are taken from both Wolf3D as well as its sequel, Spear of Destiny.
	.
	Other changes from the original include new power-ups: an ammo box (taken from Spear of Destiny) and backpack that increases the maximum amount of ammo that can be carried.
	.
	The original's weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two completely new tools of destruction: a flame thrower and a rocket launcher.

release: 1998-01-01
players: 2
rating: 70%
description:
	Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.
	.
	Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.
	.
	There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.
	.
	There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

	Zero 5 was one of the last Telegames releases for the Jaguar, right before Worms. It is a wild space-shooter, placing you in control of a small and manuverable fighter craft, or a powerful warship, depending upon which level you play.
	.
	Taking on the role of a pilot, you must defend the earth from alien attack with dozens of missions needed to succeed. Your tour of duty includes travelling through deep space to meet enemy convoys head on and shooting across asteroid and planet surfaces taking out installations.
	.
	There are 3 different play modes:
	.
	1. HIT-PAK Mode - Somewhat like a variation on the Missle Command 3D VR mode. You are in a turret with four guns to blast everything in sight, including asteroids in several levels. No powerups make it more difficult.
	.
	2. BAMBAM Mode - Consists of piloting around in the fighter, shooting every object that moves, in 360 degrees. Includes power-ups for weapons, shields, and score.
	.
	3. TRENCH Mode - Star Wars style shooting in your BAMBAM fighter, you run along a trench. Also includes power-ups.

	The sequel to Zool sees him take on the bad guys Mental Block and Krool across 15 levels.
	.
	Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular "Ninja of the Nth Dimension" (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks.
	.
	On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.

	Fast-paced action-puzzle game where the player eliminates colored shapes that are approaching his alter ego, another colored shape, before they reach the top, ala Tetris.
	.
	In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and 'fire'. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.
