	This is a re-release of two Turbo CD games:  Cosmic Fantasy: Bouken Shounen Yuu and  Cosmic Fantasy II. The first game tells the story of a young man named Yuu, who is on a quest to become a Cosmic Knight. The second describes the adventures of another young man, Van, whose girlfriend was kidnapped by an evil wizard. Both games are set in a sci-fi universe with intergalactic traveling.
	.
	The Sega CD edition features improved graphics and music (the change is particularly noticeable in the first Cosmic Fantasy) (megacd). It also re-vamps the gameplay system of the first game, allowing previously passive characters to participate in battles, but also increasing the amount of enemies met in battles and modifying the difficulty level.

Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...

description:
	In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.
	.
	You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.
	.
	Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury
