	3D Block is a pirated port of Blockout, made for the Famicom by Hwang Shinwei in 1989. There are three versions: a 1989 version credited to Hwang Shinwei and a 1990 version credited to "RCM Group" with a slightly different title screen. A 1991 version exists on some multicarts and credits both. This is an adaptation of Blockout, which in itself is a 3D version of Tetris. This is emphasized with the cartridge itself, having the artwork ripped from the original game. In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.

	The game is based on the anim√© movie of the same name. The year is 2019, 31 years after World War III. The events of the game (and of the movie) take place in a futuristic city called New Tokyo, which is controlled by corrupted military and rival gangs. You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military. While trying to free your friend, you find out a strange power is growing inside him...
	.
	The game is a traditional Japanese adventure. Instead of a menu with set commands, you have different options on each screen. After watching a cutscene or scrolling through a dialogue, you have several options to choose from. In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the "examine" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.

	Taking place 100 years before the events of Castlevania 1 and Castlevania 2, Dracula the Vampire has risen up to threaten the small village of Warakiya. Citizens who had banished the Belmont family now beg for Trevor Belmont's help in slaying Dracula. In his strange castle, Dracula has been assembling a massive army of undead creatures to sweep the Earth clean of life and bring everlasting darkness. Trevor agrees to help and equips his family's hereditary whip, the "Vampire Slayer", in order to destroy Dracula.
	Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is a side-scrolling platform game. The gameplay is nearly identical to the first Castlevania game. The player takes the role of Trevor Belmont who is able to move left and right, jump, attack with his whip straight ahead and use a special weapon. These special weapons consume hearts, which can be found by defeating monsters or destroying candles. Power-ups include: a throwing dagger, a throwing axe, A time-stopping stopwatch, a cross-shaped boomerang and a vial of holy water. Additionally there is a double shot (II) and triple shot (III) power-up which increases the number of special weapons that can be used at one time. Trevor is defeated if his life meter runs out, and can find a roast turkey power-up to replenish it. Trevor progresses through each level defeating monsters and eventually encountering a boss creature. At different points in the game the player will be able to chose between different paths, which will determine which levels are played.
	At the end of certain levels, the player may encounter a companion which can be recruited. Only one companion can accompany Trevor at any time; accepting a new companion means rejecting the existing one. Once recruited, Trevor can change between his own form and that of the companion. Each companion has an independent life meter and has unique abilities such as powerful magic, the ability to climb walls or flight. These abilities may also affect the types of power-ups that appear in candles and the exact function of special weapons.

	Kid Dracula is an unusual side-scroller from Konami.  It's  a parody of the company's popular Castlevania series. Instead of playing as a member of the Belmont family, you play as young Kid Dracula.
	.
	You have been woken up from your sleep by the evil demon Garamos, who's been wrecking havoc in Dracula's Castle. It's up to you to stop him by traveling across several different locations, including Dracula's Castle, New York, the Sea, and Egypt!
	.
	Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.

In the "game mode", you are brought in a helicopter onto a top-down "world map" area. You are told that this is Brooklyn, New York, and begin to roam the area, gradually gaining access to different casino houses.

	Armadillo is a young cowboy from Texas, who is in love with Sheryl, the cutest girl of the state. But an evil organization kidnaps his sweetheart. The matters become even more complicated when the famous Billy The Shell also embarks on a quest to save Sheryl. Will Armadillo be able to rescue the girl and to defeat his enemies?
	.
	In this game, you move Armadillo around an area map composed of squares. Some of them are empty, while others represent locations. Once you enter a location, you find yourself on a platform level, that often contains several sub-levels. There are sometimes branching ways on the area map, and you are not obliged to access all the locations to clear an area. On the platform levels, Armadillo can either walk and jump in his normal form (dies from single enemy hit), or turn into a ball, which is invulnerable to enemies' attacks, but is hard to control: the ball follows realistic physics, bounces of walls, and takes time to stop rolling. During the game, Armadillo will also be able to find upgrades that will allow him to take an animal's form for a short time.

	Asmik is not only a name of a game-developing company, but, as we learn from this game, also a cute little pink dragon. Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons.

So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.
	.
	This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.

	This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them.
	.
	The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.

	In "Atlantis no Nazo", you play a nameless archaeologist who must descend into the dangerous caverns of the lost continent Atlantis, and eventually find his way to the inner sanctum with the legendary treasure. The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.

Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. Attack Animal Gakuen is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like Space Harrier 3D for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without glasses.

For example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small, and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to face a boss enemy.

description:
	In the beginning, an archaeologist and explorer known as Indiana Borgnine, is in search of the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon. After reading some lost scriptures, he determines that the only way to see them is to travel to the very top of the 64-story Tower of Babel. Upon reaching the Tower, he discovers that the only way to access the floors above him are to solve some challenging puzzles involving loose L-shaped blocks that he finds throughout the Tower. To his great surprise, the blocks are capable of balancing very well on top of one another, in order to form staircases.
	The player controls Indiana Borgnine through 64 levels, using L-shaped blocks and vines in order to reach the exit of each level. On some levels, the exit is blocked by a mask, and there are crystal balls throughout the level. If all of the crystal balls on a level are collected, then the mask covering that level's exit will disappear, and the exit will no longer be blocked. When the exit of a level is reached, a screen is displayed showing the score achieved on that level before the character moves on to the next level. In the top right corner of the screen there is a power count. Lifting an L-shaped block causes the power count to go down by 1. Items will occasionally spawn while the player goes through the tower.es.

The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.
	.
	Scoring
	.
	Close-in goals - 1 point
	Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points
	OTH shots - 3 points
	Players may steal points from each other by making goals.
	The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.

	In this puzzle game, you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you.
	.
	On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.

description:
	Batsu & Terry is a Japanese manga that follows the adventures of a pair of eponymous friends who are highschool students and baseball stars. The game controls much like any side-scrolling platformer, with a button for jumping and another for attacking. The main character starts off as Batsu, who uses baseballs to attack enemies with either an upward or downward arc depending on the direction held while firing. Upon getting hit by enough enemies, Terry takes over and attacks enemies with a short-ranged bat attack. Killing enemies with the bat provides Terry with more life, but the lack of range is a disadvantage.
	The goal is to simply reach the end of the stage before the timer runs out. Most enemies can be defeated with attacks, but others must be avoided by jumping or running underneath them.
	The game has a reputation as a "kusoge" (endearing term for a crappy game), explicable given its background as a quickie license cash-in. It has the subtitle Makyou no Tetsujin Rasu, which roughly translates as "Ironman Race of Demon World".

The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.

When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.

	The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on "jump & run" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.

	In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.
	.
	There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word "CAPTAIN SILVER". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.
	.
	Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the "clock" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the "boot" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the "coffee?" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.
	.
	There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.

description:
	Castle Quest is a strategy game loosely based on chess by Hudson Soft. It is an interesting mix of heroic fantasy and classical chess - the player must use his pieces, a move at the time, to capture the opponent's king while protecting his own. However, Castle Quest features a lot more pieces than traditional chess such as Wizards, Ninjas, Orcs, Mummies and even Dragons.
	Each piece comes with a set of attributes such as Health, Magic, Defense and Attack and these lie at the center of the gameplay - unlike chess, when one piece attempts to take another they have to fight to determine who takes the square. Each fight is round based and driven by the roll of a dice (symbolized by playing cards going from 1 to 10). Some pieces can also use magic spells or special attacks - some pieces use healing powers whereas others throw fireballs or even resurrect lost pieces.

description:
	Edoropolis is home to a race of Animaloids, anthropomorphic animals which are a combination of flesh and cybernetic body parts. They are ruled by Shogun Tokugawa Lei Lei and his daughter, Tokugawa Usako. Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).
	.
	It's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.
	.
	However, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?
	.
	Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.
	.
	By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.
	.
	All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.

	The eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an eggs turns red it will pop almost immediately.
	Chack'n uses bombs to release the en-caged hearts and to blow up the Monstas. When the heart is released it will fly up and destroy the separator block between the level and the Mighta. Go to the Mighta and you are in the next level.
	After 14 levels there's a wedding between Mr. and Mrs. Chack'n.

	Somari  the Adventurer is a Sonic the Hedgehog port for the NES, with a twist. Instead of Sonic, the player controls Somari, which can be described as Mario in Sonic's shoes, literally.
	.
	Overall, the gameplay is quite faithful to the original game, though Somari can spindash (by pressing down and A or B), a feature fist introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Somari has to collect rings, but unlike in Sonic, if he's hit by an enemy, only three rings will fly out of him, no matter how many rings he's currently carrying.
	.
	The level sequence is faithful to the original game, with the exception of the Scrap Brain level, which wasn't finished and thus was removed from the final product. The level design ins't faithful to the original version, with constant changes throughout the game. The items and monsters are the same found in the original game, and the music is as faithfully translated to the NES as possible, with some tempo variations.

It was the critical moment of the Guldred kingdom.

	On their way to the island, unfortunately, their ship was attacked by Guemon's men. Gazem fought bravely against the pirates in vain; he got badly wounded and Liza was killed, and what is worse, Princess Karen was imprisoned somewhere in the island of Chester Field.
	The wounded knight drifted to the island, where he was treated by a young man named Kein. Gazem, however, breathed his last and after he told Kein all of his story.
	Deeply moved by his story, Kein decided to go on a journey to reconstruct the Guldred kingdom. He had to rescue Princess Karen from the hand of the enemy and to fight against Guemon.

	An evil leader and his gang of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the land and only one man stands in their way. Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.
	.
	You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red "W" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue "W" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.
	.
	There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.

	Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.

	Cosmic Wars takes you back to the Gradius universe as the 650-year long alliance between the Gradius empire and the Bacterions shatters and war breaks out again. The difference this time is that instead of fighting from the cockpit of your Vic-Viper starfighter you'll now be taking the commander's chair and take strategic control of your entire fleet.
	.
	The game is a turn-based strategy game in which you must first assemble your armada and then take them into outer space to defeat the enemy fleet. You view the action from a top-down galactic map and success in each phase rewards you with further cash which you can use to buy more ships. The game will continue until the enemy fleet is obliterated (or yours).
	.
	The game doesn't include a campaign, but instead provides you with a scenario designer from which you select the AI difficulty, which side you will take (you can play as either the Gradius empire or the Bacterions) the map you'll play and away you go. Features single or 2-player Vs gameplay.

	CosmoStation Noah, located in Spiral Galaxy IX, is under siege by Molok Wardrivers. Now it's time for the pilot of the RH119 to fend off the Molok Wardrivers and save the CosmoStation.
	.
	Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.

	Cosmo Police Galivan puts the player in control of a human being armed with a beam blade, which is only able to attack monsters in close proximity. As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and "cosmo points" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.
	The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.

	The year is 199x and a robot army has invaded Tokyo City. A boy and a girl (who remain unnamed) board their ships to fight off the threat.
	.
	This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action. Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for two players to play at the same time.
	.
	The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.
	.
	When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an invincible super ship.
	.
	Crisis Force was only released in Japan.

	One of many grand war simulations in Daisenryaku series, Daisenryaku for Famicom is a turn-based strategy with quite modern armies, the abstract "Blue" and "Red" countries (controlled by the player or AI), are at war with each other. Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Attack is possible, when enemies are near.
	The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.) Each terrain type has different movement and defence values. This version uses "fake hexagons" for battlefields; the hexagons are in fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It also has a less complex management system than the computer versions.

	DAIVA Story 6: Imperial of Nirsartia is the sixth part of a seven part series developed by Toshiba EMI. The series is not a collection of sequential stories, but rather a presentation of the same story from seven different perspectives. Billed as an "Active Simulation War", each game has the player direct a different protagonist (or "hero") through a galactic war. In most versions, the player must travel from planet to planet, defeating enemy defense armadas, and then storming the planet in a mobile attack suit, destroying as much of the planet's defense systems as possible, all in an effort to take over the planet.nnWhen designing the Famicom version of the game, Toshiba EMI took the system's capabilities, as well as it younger market audience, in to account. The game has been considerably simplified compared to its computer counterparts. Before starting an action sequence, the player is allowed to place three power-ups along a map of the stage. When the player reaches these designated locations, the specified power-up will fall from the sky for the player to collect. The game concludes when the player locates and conquers two specific planets; the Vuritora manufacturing planet, and Nirsartia.

	There's a cross-country motorcycle rally going from San Fransisco to New York. In Rally Bike, the player has but one goal, to work their way up through the ranks of the racers and place high enough to qualify for the next race. The game contains six stages to race through.
	.
	The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.
	.
	Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides  invincibility.
	.
	If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2 cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).

	Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi he no Tabi. Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist "swordsman" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.

	Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yjutsushi (lit. Deep Dungeon IV: The Black Sorcerer) is the fourth and final installment in the Deep Dungeon series. Unfortunately this game has removed the custom character feature of the previous game. Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept "requests" from the non-player characters. These are optional tasks that will reward the player with bonus items, experience or money when finished.

His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola.Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's "Life" meter.

	Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo - Zenin Shugo! is a Japanese-only sequel to the classic beat 'em up/rpg hybrid Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari aka River City Ransom.
	.
	The game takes place in the Edo period of Japan, making it a prequel really, as you take control of an ancestor of Kunio (also named Kunimasa) tasked with saving the life of his ill friend. Kunimasa must traverse the Japanese countryside beating the collection of gang members and other assorted baddies in the same way as in River City Ransom. Each location is represented by a side scrolling level filled with enemies, which you must take down using a collection of attacks and special moves that can be purchased from shops scattered through the levels.
	.
	The game uses the same engine and Super-Deformed character design, only changing the sprites to reflect the new setting. Unlike RCR, you can freely select which stage to tackle at any time, making it a more non-linear experience. And while money is still used to buy items, weapons and moves, you now also gain experience directly by defeating enemies, which is used to enhance Kunio's base stats.
	.
	A two-player mode is available and, even if you play the game solo, the game provides help in the form of an AI-controlled partner who can be change as you gain more allies  thorough the game (including former enemies).

	Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).

	The game is based on the popular Japanese manga series "Dragon Ball" - more precisely, its Saiyajin Saga part. It follows the events that occur after the evil Radditz tells Son Goku, the series' main hero, about his true origin as a Saiyajin, and suggests uniting their powers. As Son Goku refuses, a battle takes place, and the defeated Radditz threatens to harm Son Goku's son, Son Gohan. Many friends come to help Son Goku, and even his rival Piccolo joins forces with him. But the quest leads them much further - to the ultimate battle against the leader of Saiyajin...
	.
	In this fighting/RPG game, you control multiple characters from the series: Son Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, Chao-Zu, and Son Gohan. You have to train each character by taking him to battles. All the movements in the game, in battle as well as on the field, occur by collecting and choosing cards of various strength. You move around by selecting a card, and can advance a certain amount of fields depending on its value. You train characters in special training stations before taking them to fights. Once you have trained your character and chose the cards, the battles flow automatically, as cinematic sequences that show Son Goku and his foes exchanging blows while flying.

	The second in the Dragon Ball Z RPG series, "Freezer the Planet Destroyer", as it is often unofficially translated, follows closely the popular manga series and continues the story of the first Dragon Ball Z RPG,  Assault of Saiyajins. After the fight against the Saiyajin leader Vegeta, Son Goku, the series' main hero, is heavily wounded, while his ally Piccolo is dead. Son Goku's son Son Gohan and his friends go to the planet Namek to find the magical Dragon Balls that would bring Piccolo back to life. The trouble is, Vegeta is heading to the planet, and so does the evil Freezer, who is also after the Dragon Balls...
	.
	You control both Son Gohan's and Son Goku's parties, including popular characters like Krillin, Yamcha, and others. The gameplay is pretty much the same as in the first game. Locations are composed of squares, and you move through them in a board-game-like fashion, drawing cards that will determine the amount of moves you can make. Random cards will also make you participate in battles, heal your party, add extra cards, etc. In battles you also depend on cards - your choice determines the strength of the move and the outcome of the automatic battle.

	In this game, you control many characters from the anim√© series, including Son Goku, Son Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Trunk, and even the archrival Vegeta, who has now joined the team.

The cinematic battle sequences are now more fast-paced, and there are many mini-games to speed up the leveling up.

You have a limited supply of arrows, but you can find quivers among other items in the dungeons.

description:
	Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example), draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family: It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.
	The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.
	"Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.

The second is "Cosmos Mode", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however.

You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.
	.
	More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).

description:
	This 2D platformer has elements of role-playing and adventure in addition to side-scrolling action.
	.
	The story is a classic one of good versus evil.  Disaster strikes the once peaceful Elf town of Eolis. The sky rains meteorites upon the World Tree - wild animals and evil monsters terrorize the citizens - the water supply from the wells is dwindling - plants are withering - people are dying. Only you can restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil Place.
	.
	There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score.  You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items.  Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell.
	.
	As areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in ‚Äúlevels‚Äù and achieves a new ‚Äúrank‚Äù which is tied directly to the restore password (called a ‚Äúmantra‚Äù in the game).

	Fighting Road is a one-on-one fighting game in which you take the role of a nameless martial artist out to pummel a collection of enemy fighters in order to be crowned grand master.
	.
	The game plays from a non-scrolling side view and plays like most one-on-one fighters: you move around the screen avoiding your opponent's attacks and then unleash your own with combinations of your attack buttons and directional arrows. Additionally the game features special moves in the form of specific combinations of directional moves that trigger unique attacks. These moves however deplete your stamina bar which can leave you defenseless against enemy attacks.

	Final Fantasy II (not to be mistaken with Final Fantasy IV, released in USA as "Final Fantasy II"), like its predecessor, is a top-down role-playing game where you travel through the overworld, fighting baddies and buying things and resting in cities. It features round-based combat (you input menu commands for the whole party, and then watch the combat round unfold). It has an unusual character-building system: there are no classes and also no levels, but characters grow stronger by performing the same action over and over. Get hit a lot and your HP will increase; cast more spells and your intelligence will raise (but your physical power might decrease), and so on. Weapons and spells, on the other side, can be leveled up. The more you use a certain type of level, the more proficient the character who uses this weapon becomes; the more you cast a certain magic spell, the more damage it does.

	The initial race takes place on an oval track in New York while subsequent tracks with more challenging turns and corners will take players all over the world; from Mexico to Monaco. Each car can be upgraded before a race with allotted points to customize the tires, engine, brakes, and nitro. Nitro is kicked in by pressing up on the control pad. Colliding into competitors will bump your car back but sliding into billboards on the side can cause your vehicle to spin out.

	Fire Emblem is a strategy game where you have to move your units on a map. You can control the blue units while the red ones are enemies. You have to attack enemies from various ranges, in function of the weapon you're using. Usually, you have to be one or two squares next to the enemy. When a battle is set, you see both characters; allies in blue on the right and the opponent in red on the left with a detailed animation. The enemy will counterattack if he can, and either you or the enemy may also do one more hit to close the battle. When you've finished, it's the computer's turn and it will do the same with its units. Once the HP (Health Points) of any unit reaches 0, they are definitely out of battle and can't return again, whether it's an enemy or an ally.

description:
	Fleet Commander is a strategy game developed and published by ASCII Entertainment for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.
	A couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the "Turbo File," which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.

description:
	This is a sequel to the  first Ganbare Goemon Gaiden (side-story) RPG. Goemon, a cunning thief and an avid treasure hunting, has nothing to do and sits in his house, bored. But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure won't be just given to Goemon: he'll have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...
	.
	The game is very similar to its predecessor, as well as to most other console-style RPGs of the period. You talk to people in towns, buy various equipment, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. The combat perspective is slightly changed in this sequel (over-the-shoulder view of the battle instead of semi-animated pictures).

	Garfield, the lovable fat orange cat, has gotten himself into a spot of trouble. His pal and center of abuse, the yellow dog Odie, has gone and disappeared somewhere. Their owner, Jon, is too lazy to go look for Odie himself, so he has Garfield go out and look for him. And so Garfield heads off, out into the world.
	.
	A Week of Garfield is a side-scrolling platform game based on the comic strip by Jim Davis. Garfield heads to the right through various indoor and outdoor city environments, dealing with endless vermin like frogs, birds, and mice using his judo kick skills and several different weapons such as bones that can be thrown. He has a life bar that can quickly deplete if he isn't careful, but hidden all around each stage are various items, which can replenish his health, refill his weapon supplies, and give him super speed or invincibility; be careful, though, as sometimes he'll also find fish bones which will harm Garfield if eaten.
	.
	The game is divided into seven stages, each representing a day of the week, and each with several sections. At the end of each section is a door, and Garfield must find the key hidden somewhere on the screen to unlock the door and continue. At the last door of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated before Garfield can find the key. Each stage also has a strict time limit to keep him from dawdling, and between stages, Jon will appear to encourage Garfield or give him some advice.

description:
	Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and y√Ö kai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.
	Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.
	The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.

	Geimos is an arcade style space shooter where players take control of a spaceship that flies over several different planets' surfaces destroying the incoming enemy units.
	The game contains two different game modes. "Mode A" keeps the games camera perspective in the same position. Players have control over their spaceships altitude while flying around the screen and can fire two different weapons. One weapon is meant for ground enemies while the other weapon is meant for aerial enemies. While the majority of the enemies are gun towers, ships and tanks that can be defeated in one shot, at the end of each round players will have to face off with a gigantic boss enemy that will require several shots to defeat.
	Mode B is similar to Mode A, but now the camera follows the players ship's movements instead. This mode also features a fixed target reticle in front of the player's ship to help with aiming their fire.

There are also a few first-person dungeons later in the game. In the dungeons you can collect money and then use it to buy weapons and other accessories on the overworld.

	In the hardest difficulty levels, players are confronted with wind levels approaching that of a hurricane while the wind is almost stagnant in the easiest difficulty level.[3] One of the drawbacks of the game is that the player must determine the angle of their flight separately from the strength of their swing and the type of golf club that they will use.

Bonus points can be gained by picking up diamonds and other valuables, rescuing the other Goonies, or by dispatching enemies with your slingshot or kicking them.

description:
	Grand Master is an action RPG, featuring a cool intro, neat music, and most importantly: a hero with a sword so high you can't get over it, so low you can't get under it, and so wide you can't get around it.
	The game itself plays from a top-down perspective, a bit like The Legend of Zelda, but with some extra RPG elements added in. It features a basic leveling system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the first five stages.
	The game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid, Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will
	get the bad ending.If you enter the Pyramid before the Cave level, you will get an alternate story branch.

Because of the unituitive controls, and unforgiving game mechanics, this game is considered quite difficult and generally not fun to play.

	Ufouria is a (side scrolling) platform adventure video game. You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.
	.
	The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.

	During the course of this video game, Hello Kitty must water all the flowers in each stage while avoiding the many animals and insects. Kitty's ribbon always stays on the left side of her ear; even if the player changes the orientation of the character.
	She can defend herself with the use of a large mallet. Running into enemies will make her cry, which causes Kitty to get angry and lose a life. Points in the game are collected as money for the cash register. Allowing the time limit to expire will also cause the player to lose a life. However, there are infinite continues and losing the game score is the only penalty for "game overs." There are 18 stages in the game and the game does not repeat itself after the 18th stage. While the second half of the game is more difficult then the first nine levels, they can be cleared once the player is accustomed to the game controls.

	The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.
	.
	Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid ‚Äì a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.
	.
	Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.

	In this second installment of "Greek mythology" RPG series, the main hero is not the legendary hero Herakles (Hercules), but a young boy from a town Nana, where he lives with his grandmother. The queen tells you that people are being tortured by Titans - an ancient god-like race controlled by the Lord of darkness. You must help to liberate people from the wrath of the Titans. Your first assignment is to go to Athens and to find the famous poet Homer who can tell you about the way to defeat the Titans. During your journey you meet many characters from the Greek mythology, including Daedalus, Cerberus, and Hephaestus, and recruit interesting creatures to fight at your side, such as the half-horse Centaur or the Woman Without Soul. You'll also encounter real people from the Greek history, like Homer the poet or Hippocrates the doctor.
	.
	The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Warrior style: you travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, talking to people, and fighting random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. An interesting innovation is a full day/night cycle. Locations look different at night, and it is sometimes necessary to visit them at different times.

Here you play as the bandit Gaou, who lost an arm and eye as a baby and as such was scorned by his peers. Since then he has resorted to various tactics, not least murder, to survive. However, one day he fought a monk who encouraged him to change his ways and follow his unfound natural talent to sculpt, which is thus put to good use in a variety of sculptures unique in their raw emotion. And then, he meets a fellow sculptor, Akanemaru, who once was attacked by him, and the two engage in encounters with a phoenix, who, it is said, will grant to those who drink its blood eternal life - and the rest is history.

	Higemaru Makaijima (Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken, lit. Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed "Makai Island".
	In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.
	Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.

	Hirake! Ponkikki was a long-running Japanese children's program similar to Sesame Street; this game features the show's two main characters, Gachapin the dinosaur and Mukku the yeti, in a little friendly competition. Five mini-games repeat over the course of five islands, and each island must be cleared of all five games before proceeding to the next. The set-up is mainly intended for two players, with one player controlling Gachapin and the other Mukku. In one-player mode, either character may be selected, but the CPU will not compete at any game other than rock-paper-scissors. Players begin with a limited number of lives which may be lost by colliding with enemies or performing poorly at minigames; one extra life is also awarded at the end of each island. However, there is also a password system which allows the game to be resumed from any island.

	Combat whisks you away from the top-down perspective to a battle view in which you see your opponents and heroes in a first-person perspective, and assign actions in turns, with the ESP powers taking the place of magic spells.

description:
	After the evil dragon lord Varalys tried to enchant the princess Ann, he was thought to be defeated by a brave warrior. But evil can never be defeated once and for all - once again, a curse has fallen upon the land, and you, a nameless young boy, is the only one who can save it. Equipped with your magical sword, you must roam the land of Hydlide and defeat the evil once again.
	.
	This is the second NES game of Hydlide series ("Hydlide 2" was only available for the MSX platform). You can choose one of the four character classes to start the game with, and also upgrade your class during the game. The combat is action-based: you can either attack your enemies by ramming them with your weapons, or cast magical spells. In towns there are equipment and items to buy.

	Hey there, this is the Nekketsu High School Paper. Our own Kunio has become famous as a leader. With him we won both the dodge ball and soccer championships. They competed and won at the world stage, it is truly amazing. But did you know, Nekketsu High also has an ice hockey club? Sadly, our team is very weak... We probably won't even make the playoffs in the next national championship. Perhaps Kunio can lead our ice hockey team to victory as well. With him, would it become a successful team, or still be in the minor leagues? Passionate ice hockey spirit! Good luck everyone!

description:
	The game is set in medieval Japan, where a poor farming village is planning an insurrection to overthrow their feudal overlord. However, the only participants in the revolt are the player's character, Gonbe, and the optional second-player character, Tago (??), and the player battles against an army of ninjas instead of samurai and foot soldiers. The game displays text in the vertical direction, which was very unusual for a game of the period, and all in-game messages use speech reminiscent of jidaigeki films.
	The game consists of four different levels, with the fifth level being an alternate version of the first, the sixth being an alternate version of the second, and so on. The difficulty gradually increases as the game progresses, and the game levels loop infinitely. There is no ending screen for the game, and completion of level 99 brings the player to level 00, which is an alternate version of the fourth level. The player returns to level 01 after completing level 00. A "secret letter" appears on-screen after each of the first 8 levels in the Famicom version. The secret letters displayed are E, R, A, W, T, F, O, S, in order, and if the letters are read backwards as indicated in the game's instruction manual, they form the word "SOFTWARE." This code word was required for the gift campaign that was conducted during the game's initial release.

	In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate.
	Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

	JJ is an action game developed and published by Square for the Famicom in 1987. In English, it is sometimes referred to by its long form, Jumpin' Jack, or by its subtitle, Tobidase Daisakusen Part II. The game was only released in Japan. The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets. JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the "3D mode" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.

	To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.

	Juvei Quest is a RPG which could easily compete with the heavyweights like Dragon Quest. The title contains an immense story, lovely characters, thoughtful turn-based battle system with many skills and abilities to use. the game even came packaged with a table game.
	The story itself unfolds in the Age of Sengoku of Ancient Japan attacked by some demonic force called "The Demonic Horde", being quite a loose interpretation of the famous one-eyed samurai - Yagyuu Juubei, one of the most romanticized figures in Japanese history who presumably lived during the second Shogun Tokugawa's.

	The legend of Kaguya-hime is one of the most popular stories in Japanese mythology. Once upon a time, an old man went to the forest to cut some bamboo, and found a little baby girl. He took her to his house and named her Kaguya-hime. She grew up there, and soon became the most beautiful girl of Japan. Many young men, including the son of the emperor himself, tried to conquer her heart, but for no avail. One day Kaguya-hime confessed she was a moon angel, and returned back to the moon. In this game, you control the son of the emperor, and you'll do your best to reach Kaguya-hime and to protect her. You must overcome various obstacles and meet characters from Japanese folklore.
	.
	The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: all the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a  top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as "look", "take", or "use" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under "extras", such as "kiss", "attack", and even "undress".

description:
	Kaijuu Monogatari ("Shell Creature Story") is an 8-bit RPG for the NES that more than superficially resembles Enix's Dragon Quest. As with many RPG contemporaries for the system, it borrows the basic premise (talk to the King, discover what to do next, fight some evil force) and the turn-based tactical combat and gradual character development of its major influence, but also much of its aesthetic: The box art has some Akira Toriyama-inspired artwork and the protagonist wears a familiar suit of blue armor. Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle - Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name.
	The plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors, then regrouping for another attack.
	A unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high level.
	The game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.

	One day, a mysterious theme park called Karakuri Land appeared in Edo. In it were various mechanical attractions, built around different themes. Many people went to visit, and the park was very popular. The princess asked Yanchamaru if he would like to go with her, but since he was busy with his training, she went by herself. However, she didn't come back, and so Yanchamaru must make his way through the oddly-aggressive attractions to find and rescue the princess!
	.
	Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 is the sequel to Kid Niki, and once again stars the big-headed, sword-spinning, headband-sporting fighter Yanchamaru. Each stage is based around a theme, such as a world built from cakes and a world built from volcanoes, and each is filled with animatronic enemies, with a boss at the end. Yanchamaru has his trusty spinning sword, and can also find bonus items to improve his abilities and increase his score.

Miraculously, it reaches her boyfriend Yanchamaru who, being the upstanding samurai that he is, immediately sets out to save her.
	.
	Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 is the final sequel to Kid Niki and is a significant departure from the first two games. Not only does the game feature full four-way scrolling and large maps to explore, but Yanchamaru himself sports a completely new look and numerous new abilities. His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a bo, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.
	.
	Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.

	Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru is a side-scrolling platform game by Capcom. Hanamaru, a ninja boy in training, is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre happenings and disappearances. In a local theme park called Leisure Island, children have been mysteriously disappearing and these disappearances are being attributed to a ruthless rival gang of ninjas. Equipped with his red mask and a mechanical hawk, it is up to the brave Hanamaru to journey throughout the park's fourteen areas and to rescue the captive children. The young ninja can run, jump or allow his hawk companion to attack enemies at long range. He can also collect special scrolls to increase his magic powers and cast various spells (press Down and B to activate them) - they range from lightning attack (kills all enemies on screen), ground shake (kills all enemies on the ground), Fire Hawk (unleashes the hawk super dive attack) and super jump (increases jumping speed for a short amount of time). Various special items are also available throughout the game, such as extra lives, invincibility and battle cards. Battle cards are a very important part of the gameplay - every now and then, Hanamaru encounters a boss that he must fight in a really unusual way (and apparently loosely based on the traditional Japanese disciplines of Ninjutsu). Boss battles are round based, and the player must pick a card with a higher face value than his opponent, and the difference represents how much damage the player (or the boss) takes. Thankfully, Hanamaru can collect special battle cards along the way - some can double or triple the face value of a card, whereas others prevent the boss from being able to attack for a round, or help Hanamaru regain some life. Although most of the game offers traditional side scrolling platformer action, several levels try out very different gameplay styles (Hanamaru can ride a Skateboard in some stages, or fly through the air with the help of his hawk companion).

To get there, he is traveling through the Tokaido highway which is composed of 53 checkpoints along the way. However, an unscrupulous merchant is attempting to capture Kantarou and steal his explosive technique secrets.

Both your party and the foes can jump and attack in close combat and from a distance.

	Labyrinth is a maze game similar to Gauntlet, but with a more definite goal and some adventure elements. It is based upon the Jim Henson film of the same name incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.
	.
	The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.
	.
	Throughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.
	.
	All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.

	In 22th century, mankind has left the Earth. A new space epoch began, called the Isis era. Human beings built an oasis in deep space, a space station called LaGrange Point. From there, they could send expeditions to remote planets and to explore the space. You control a young pilot named Jin. One day, when you descend into LaGrange from your space ship, you are attacked by mysterious robotic invaders. Your task is now to travel through space and to find out the cause of the assault. But you don't even suspect you'll soon be involved in a deep mystery that was destined long time ago...
	.
	"LaGrange Point" is one of the few old-school console-style RPGs to be set in a science fiction environment and to feature space flights. The combat system requires you to use special points (called BP) in order to perform simple attacks, cast spells, and use various techniques that will cost you your HP. You fight random monsters and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, like in Phantasy Star series.

In order to get the fame and funding necessary to make Childs a big hit, the player (as the manager) must "fight" various stressed out officials and convince them to give the band royalties, equip the band with the equipment they need to perform and fly across Japan setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as a single entity - each piece of equipment also applies to every band member simultaneously.
	The game plays almost identically to Dragon Quest, but is made considerably stranger by its modern Japanese setting and unusual premise.

	Totally Rad is an action-adventure game in which you play Jake, a magician wannabe being trained by the Master Magician Zebediah. One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.
	.
	This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.
	.
	Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.

	Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.
	.
	The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.
	.
	After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.
	.
	After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.
	.
	The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.

The player must explore every possible option in order for new choices to appear. However, if the player makes a wrong selection, the game will end and the player must restart the game from where they left off. The player can quit at any point of the game and continue later via a password feature.
	The game takes place eight years after a great war was waged between colonies in outer space, and peace has finally settled back onto the Earth. The main character, a 17-year-old war orphan named Tadashi Himukai, purchases a used worker-mech in order to start a construction business with his girlfriend, Elina Furfa. However, when he first activates it, the worker-mech disguise falls away, revealing a combat model Metal Slader, which were all supposedly dismantled after the war, and an enigmatic message is displayed in the cockpit: "EARTH IN PERIL... SEEK THE CREATOR". Prompted by this warning, Tadashi, his sister Azusa, and Elina head out into space to find the answers behind it.
	It was the final game released by HAL Laboratory as an independent third-party developer before their buy-out by Nintendo. The game's story and character designs were done by manga artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who loosely based the game on his 1984 manga Ak√ªtens√¥ Fixallia

	Minelvaton Saga: Ragon no Fukkatsu is a Role Playing Game first in the Minelvaton series, being followed by Silva Saga and ending with Silva Saga II: The Legend of Light and Darkness.
	Minelvaton Saga takes place on the world Minelvaton, in the area known as Southern Ofelia. In the kingdom of Palmeccia both the King and Queen have been murdered by the hands of a servant of Ragon, son of the Zuhl. The player takes control of the Prince of Palmeccia in a quest for revenge and to kill the evil Ragon.
	Fundamentally, the game plays and looks like Dragon Quest. The player is given control of a single character and can explore a number of towns, dungeons, and the world map itself. However, once the player receives the ship for sailing, the game becomes non-linear as the player can explore almost anywhere that can be reached.
	Another unique feature is the battle system. Like a typical RPG, there are random battles, but actual combat resembles a sort of action RPG. In battle, the player starts at the bottom of the screen facing the enemies that are at the top. In order to defeat enemies, the player must run into one in order to exchange blows. The closest analog to this unusual system is the MMORPG, or the MMORPG-ish single player game Final Fantasy XII.
	Beyond that, the basic plot and some of the battle system concept seems to have been co-opted by Sega's Sword of Vermilion.

You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.

The man's name was George, the woman's name was Maria. Two years passed, and George suddenly returned. He never spoke to anyone about what he had experienced. Instead, he lead a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned.
	.
	Eighty years have passed since then. You play the role of a young boy who lives in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters. One day, something strange happens: the house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and to learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge. The four heroes will explore the world and find out the connection between the strange events of today and the mystery of the past.

On Madara's 15th birthday, when most of the world had already fallen to the Moki controlled by the Emperor Miroku, Madara sets out to find his real body and save the world from the Moki.
	.
	Mouryou Senki Madara is an RPG in which players control a party consisting of up two four characters exploring towns, dungeons and a world map from a top-down perspective. Battles occur randomly and the characters move and fight autonomously, although it is possible to pause battles at any time and order characters to fight, defend, use magic or items or flee. Furthermore, a basic battle strategy (attack, defend, stop or flee) can be selected from a tactics menu, where it is also possible to change the characters' starting formation.

	The player controls a young boy called Musashi, who lives somewhere in medieval Japan in the village of Arima . He is the son of the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and a skilled fighter himself. One day he hears of a rumor that the evil wizard Kojiro, his father's archenemy, has apparently reared up his ugly head once again! Kojiro's demons invade the land, and threaten death and destruction. "I shall defeat Kojiro!" - says Musashi, - "and maybe even get laid"...
	.
	Musashi no Boken can be described as Dragon Warrior set in feudal Japan, as apart from the distinct classical Japanese flavor demonstrated here, the games are very similar. Musashi travels over the world map, visits towns, buys weapons and armor, descends into dungeons, and fights enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective.

description:
	Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu (lit. "Sword of Musashi - Now in the Middle of Training") is based on a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Motoka Murakami that focuses on kendo, simply titled Musashi no Ken. The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.
	The game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.
	There are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him. Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses, Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over.
	On two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three or more victories wins the game.

	Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Issh 80 Nichi Dai Boken (lit. "Puss in Boots: An Adventure Around the World in 80 Days") is a video game based on the third film of The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots that was released exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer. Four years later, the game (with several modifications) was released in North America under the title Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure.
	Pero has to either avoid or eliminate this cat-like enemies who stands in his way. The main character is the Puss in Boots character from the tale; a cat named Pero (Toei Animation's mascot) He is also known as 'Perrault' in the game, as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story; Charles Perrault. He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through the use of trickery.
	Loosely based on Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored include: England, the Atlantic Ocean, Arabia, Hong Kong, the Pacific Ocean, Alaska, the North Pole, and Big Ben. The game features "death water," a video game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact with a watery substance.
	This game also involves driving boats, cars, and balloons in addition to the standard walking through the stages.

	Kakuto Densetsu is another 2d side scrolling beat'em up in Nekketsu High series, featuring the same gameplay which involves beating up your enemies in side scrolling levels with a combination of punches, kicks and special moves. The differences in this title however, are that the entire game is laid out as 2-on-2 tournament fights in non-scrolling arenas in which your team must come up on the winning end and advance to the next round. You can play with good old Kunio or create your own character and advance his stats as he goes along in standard Nekketsu High fashion, and you can play alone with an AI-controlled partner or with a friend (you can also go for a 4-player battle royale in the Vs mode).
	.
	Backgrounds have a major role in the fights, with several hazard zones and unique features, and the game also encourages teamwork as many special moves can be unlocked only by combining both of your characters (depending on their compatibility)

But one of the king's guards, Radley, took the young heir of the throne and brought him securely to Damascus, where he grows up. Realizing he is the true prince of the Littleland dynasty, the young hero follows Radley's instructions and sets on a quest to find seven magical rainbow pieces, which alone will be able to destroy Zrool.

Instead, by fighting a lot your popularity increases, and you are able to trade items by buying them in one town and selling in another. Trading is the only effective way of getting money in the game. You become stronger by buying and equipping better weapons and armor. Also, there is a thirst factor in the game. You have to drink water regularly, or else you'll be dried to death.

	Ninja Hattori-kun (lit. "Little Ninja Hattori") is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.
	The plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year-old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on.
	In the game, player controls Kanzo Hattori in a side-scrolling action game. Hattori must run to the right over various terrains, but primarily through the woods. In addition to using throwing stars, Hattori can access one of the other ninja techniques, like Kagebashin, Happou no Shuriken, etc. In fact, he learns a total of 11 ninpou; however, he must first collect scrolls that provide those abilities before he can use them. Due to sluggish controls, it can be difficult to clear some of the obstacles that he will face without the ninja abilities to enhance his mobility.

	The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.
	It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.
	Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.

	In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate.
	.
	Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.
	.
	In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.
	.
	As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.
	.
	Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.
	.
	The items in this game are:
	.
	1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.
	.
	2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!
	.
	3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.
	.
	4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.
	.
	5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
	2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!
	.
	6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.
	.
	7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.

	Ashura no Shou expands upon the basic gameplay introduced in Ninjakun, by introducing new exploration concepts and challenging the player to complete 31 stages of action, with branching levels, larger enemies, and boss battles. The game was ported to the MSX and published by HAL Laboratory. It was also ported to the Famicom in 1988. A US release for the NES was planned under the name Ninja Taro, but ultimately cancelled. The Famicom port was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2009.

	Oishinbo puts us in the role of Yamaoka Shiro as he helps brainstorm for Tozai News' upcoming VIP banquet. He meets with a trio of gourmands visiting his publication, one of whom extols the culinary merits of foie gras. Shiro is dismissive due to its ugly appearance (never mind the animal cruelty), causing a heated argument between the two. Filled with rage, Shiro heads back to his desk to try and come up with a dish that will blow foie gras out of the water.nnnnIt is here that the game begins in earnest, and the most familiar hallmark of the ADV genre begins to rear its head: busywork. The player needs to look at and interact with everything they possibly can if they want to make any progress, often multiple times. The lengths of which the game goes to to pad itself out is often ridiculous, such as when Shiro is only able to visit his own workplace cafeteria after reading a sign that informs him that it exists.

description:
	Players must play the role of a mother cat called Milky who lives in a dangerous metropolis full of dogs. The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.
	Unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be "average" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of "dog catches cat; cat catches fish" - emulating the food chain.

	Tetsuya Wakatsuki was just an average guy, lazy but well-meaning, and a photographer for the local newspaper. Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.
	.
	They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!
	.
	Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.

When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss.
	.
	There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

description:
	Palamedes II can be described as "its predecessor, turned upside down". As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.
	.
	Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer.
	.
	Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in match or quest mode.

	Having been sucked into and stranded in an alternate universe, you and your girlfriend must work your way around the puzzles of a magnificent castle to make your way back home.
	.
	The castle itself consists of a total of twenty worlds consisting of five stages apiece, each of which is filled to the brim with enemies. From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).
	.
	This game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.

	There's a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and there's a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff. You can't fly though, but you can jump, which is pretty useless. What's cool about this game is the sheer amount of fun crazy bonus rooms you can go into and sometimes at the end of these rooms you can earn neat stuff, like new weapons or weapon upgrades.

	A pizza delivery guy is in love with a girl named Betty. He's going about his careless job, delivering in hopes of big tips, when something catches his eye. It's a beautiful diamond ring, and it's impossible to resist! Unfortunately, it costs $10,000 - way beyond his budget. And to make matters worse, another man named Nick has eyes for Betty. Now our hero will have to work extra, EXTRA hard to buy it and impress Betty!
	In Pizza Pop!, the player fights through seven crazy neighborhoods populated by a whole host of pizza-hungry characters. The player can, however, defeat his enemies by jumping on them, or whacking them with his pizza pan. The player can also run through the level or use motor vehicles to get around, but he can't run for too long or else he'll get tired - unless he jumps while running. In addition, there are two pizza-stacking mini-games which can earn the player points and extra lives.

	Pocket Zaurus: Ju Ouken no Nazo (possibly translated as "Pocket Zaurus: Mystery of Ten Kings Swords", the Ten Kings are the ten judges of hell who review the conduct of the recently deceased) is an action game developed by Bandai and published in February 1987. At the time of this game's release, Bandai produced a line of dinosaur pens, stationary, and similarly theme school supplied under the label Pocket Zaurus. As such, the game itself has a slight educational aspect to it.
	The game is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control Hashimoto-Zaurus, named after Hashimoto, an employee of Bandai who presumably invented the concept of Pocket Zaurus. Despite sharing the name with the product line, characters which resemble those used in the product are hardly ever seen, and the enemies are not at all related either. The idea for the game was submitted by a reader of the game magazine "Family computer Magazine," which was published by Tokuma Shoten.

description:
	In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.
	.
	The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.
	.
	The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)
	.
	The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.

description:
	Popeye no Eigo Asobi (Popeye's English Game) is the Japanese-exclusive spin-off to the Popeye arcade game.
	The game includes three modes: Word Puzzle A, Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.[3] In Word Puzzle A (based on the first level of the original game), the player is given the Japanese term for a word in one of six categories: Animal, Country, Food, Sports, Science, and Others (due to technical limitations, these terms are displayed entirely as katakana, regardless of their origin).[3] Blank squares for the English word are given, and the player must maneuver Popeye around to point to letters of the alphabet in order to fill in the blanks. Each wrong letter entry prompts Brutus/Bluto to punch a basket carrying Swee'Pea; the player must solve the puzzle before Swee'Pea's basket is knocked off the platform it is attached to.
	The player may also forfeit the puzzle by punching the "?" icon. If the puzzle is lost or forfeited, the correct English word will be displayed. Word Puzzle B is identical to the "A" mode; however, the player is not given the Japanese term beforehand. In the two-player Word Catcher mode (based on the third level of the original game), the first player controls Popeye and the second controls Bluto. Three Japanese words are displayed on the screen's left side, and both players compete to collect letters thrown by Olive Oyl to spell out their English equivalents. A player wins when he or she has correctly spelled five words.

During the pre-set (not random) battles, your party and the enemies can freely move around the battle screen. You control the main character by attacking in real time, but you can pause at any time and give a command to other party members: attack a specified enemy, be offensive in general, use a healing or other technique, pretend to be dead, etc.

	Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.
	.
	Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.

	RPG Jinsei Game  is a Japan-only role playing game for the Family Computer that is similar to Jinsei Game, which is the Japanese version of The Game of Life.
	The object is to explore a city full of stores, places of employment, and learning places. Starting from home, the player must earn money and statistics in order to unlock the better features of the game.
	Unlike most games based on the Jinsei Game series, RPG Jinsei Game doesn't use a spinner system. Instead, the controller pad is used for movement and random encounters are featured like in Dragon Quest. The player can also talk to strangers who might either give him/her advice or do something malevolent to him/her. As in the actual Game of Life board game, the player has to choose from a series of careers ranging from a musician to a photographer and even a professional wrestler. Most of these tasks are mundane while one of the quests directly involves chasing down unidentified flying objects. Buildings that are crucial to the quest (other than shops and learning places) can be fully explored; otherwise the player simply talks to the resident.
	Fights can occur like in a real role-playing game. However, the players stats are used instead of hit points and magic points

At specific parts of the game, you'll have to choose a specific character in order to trigger a story-related event.
	The gameplay is split into side-scrolling action and RPG-like turn-based fights. During the side-view sequences you travel through short levels, beating up goons who are trying to stop you, jumping and trying not to fall into the abyss. You accumulate experience points, called "Seven Senses", which you can then distribute to raise your HP or Cosmo Power. Cosmo is a kind of energy you need to perform an attack, and it decreases the more you fight. In the end of a level, a boss usually awaits you, whom you fight in turn-based style, performing punches and kicks.

	Whomp 'Em tells the tale of a little Native American Indian named Soaring Eagle who is on a quest to fill his magic pouch with totems. These totems are guarded by fearsome bosses at the end of different environments spread throughout the land. Each totem gives Soaring Eagle a new power to help him complete his journey.
	.
	Whomp 'Em is a side scrolling action platformer. The hero can run, jump, and attack with his spear. Not only can he jab forward with his spear, Soaring Eagle can also stab upwards or downwards while jumping. Further, he can use his spear to defend from attacks coming from above.
	.
	Soaring Eagle must first conquer a bossless, introductory level. From there, he is free to choose from among 6 different lands to explore: Fire test, ice ritual, secret cliff, water test, magic forest, and sacred woods. Each level is highly unique with its own dangerous enemies and lethal boss. After completing these 6 areas and collecting the associated totems, Soaring Eagle is whisked off to a cloud realm where he must use all of his accumulated power to defeat a much larger enemy.

	Sansara Naga is set in the fantasy-filled lands of India during the Vedic age and also mixes elements of Japanese folklore such as the legend of Brahman Umibozu ("sea bonze"). Many of the NPCs in game will tell you that Cows are sacred animals and a few will mention the Tower of Rta Satya. There is a set of armor in the game called Dharma Armor, which will prevent the player from dealing or being dealt damage.
	The story revolves around a Boy/Girl that steals a treasured Ostrich egg from the village of Orissa and decides to reflect upon one's actions; aspiring to become a Dragoon to restore their lost honor. The protagonist will set out on an adventure saving lives, performing good deeds, and raising a newly hatched dragon. There are bosses and many NPC street vendors will attempt to scam you with defective items or attempt to mug you. While the main protagonist does not level and their base stats are fixed at 40 STR, 40 DEF. The dragon that you raise does level. More unique game mechanics to this game include the ability to feed dead bodies to your dragon to raise his level, enchanted armors, field map events, hidden landmarks, a few side quests, and mini-games.
	Sansara Naga's gameplay and gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dragon Quest I, Pok√©mon and Earthbound.
	The Silver Mountains are also referred to as Heaven.

Each member is a demon of a different hierarchical class with His Excellency Demon Kogure being leader of demons and His Majesty Damian Hamada being crown prince of hell. In accordance to the prophecy and after completing the world conquest, the band would disband at the end of the century on December 12, 1999 at 23:59:59 Japan Standard Time (09:59:99 Eastern Standard Time).

Ironically, the dark being addressed your grandfather, saying it's been a long time. Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name Rosenkreuz. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: "Save... Miu...".

description:
	Shikinjou, or Shikinjoh, is a puzzle game inspired by Mahjong Solitaire and Sokoban. Like most Mahjong Solitaire variants, it takes its name from a region in China: in this case, the former Imperial Palace of China, also known as The Forbidden City.
	The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade.

	There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.

	Silva Saga is a game that would be boring to someone who doesn't like the Dragon Quest games on the NES.  After all, the game is basically Dragon Quest, with some easier mechanics and a different design philosophy.  If you do like the Dragon Quest games, however, you get less grinding, some pretty nice music, pleasant graphics, and a new world to explore.

	All weekend ballplayers know softball's no joke, but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with it. And when you step up to the plate in this cart you'll find the wackiest bunch of players to ever hit a softball diamond!
	.
	Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.
	.
	There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night
	.
	In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.
	.
	With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.

This game is a side scrolling adventure, where the game field advances automatically, and the screen is divided in six different floors, all of which are populated by enemies or obstacles that will kill you if you touch them; but both Son Son and Ton Ton attack their enemies by shooting small bullets at them out of their weapons (a magic cane and a pitchfork, respectively). Their attack can also stop many enemy projectiles! Your chosen character must jump from floor to floor, evading hunters, bats, fish, statues, insects, skull coins, and mad bombers! As you advance, you can pick up several food items to increase your score. Clearing the screen of enemies will also net you several hefty bonuses.
	.
	The story is heavily based upon "Journey To The West"; the player characters as well as the kidnapped ones are based upon the main characters in the story. This game is also a port of Capcom's original arcade game.

Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots.

You are told to defeat Geyla and to free the Fairy Land. But you are unsure about your motivation. Do you really wish to save the world, or are just interested in all those treasures buried deep in mountain caves, waiting for you to find them and to pick them up? You have a special meter called Toku that will indicate exactly how much you are interested in saving the world, and how much in grabbing treasures. Your actions will influence the outcome of the story...

	The gameplay is platform action with some RPG elements (such as the ability to use different weapons or to follow a specific style or behavior). You travel overworld through forests, fields, and mountains, whacking or shooting enemies, facing ferocious bosses, and descending underground, searching for treasure. There are many hazards that await you on your journey, including lava fields, pits, etc.

	Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.
	.
	Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.

	When the rulers of planet Neptune find that they are running out of their main food source ‚Äì man-ham ‚Äì they hit on a devious plan: Invade the nearby planet earth and melt the polar ice-caps, thus sinking all cities. Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.
	.
	The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.
	.
	In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.

	Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation.nnnnThe back-story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the countryside. Of course, what kind of game would it be if there weren't fearless heroes to step in and fix things? That's where the four Dice Heroes step in. The four Dice Heroes will, of course, be under your control.nnnnThe four Dice Heroes are your basic stock-issue fantasy characters. There's the fighter, he's got a moderately high amount of strength, and a decent balance of everything. There's the dwarf, who's got plenty of strength and endurance, but he's dumb as a brick. There's the elf, who's really good at magic but has no HP and very little strength. Then there's the half-elf, who's fair and balanced. You must pick one of these characters before each level, and you're stuck with them until you finish.nnnnNow, all of this may sound cliche, and you'd be correct. But all the cliches in the story are offset but the offbeat game play. Each area is made up of a path that is predetermined for the most part. Every time you move, you roll a die and move that many spaces. Some squares trigger events, which range from encounters with townsfolk, to warp tiles, to healing spring, and more. Some squares have multiple exits, and the one you end up using depends on which character you are, or how you answer a certain question. Any square without an event leads to a battle.nnnnBattle is a bit different compared to most NES role-playing games. You face monsters one-on-one, and each side rolls a die. The side that rolls the higher number gets a number of attack equal to the difference between the die rolls. So if you roll a four and the monster rolls a two, you get two attacks. The loser gets to sit there and take it. In the even of the tie, you keep the tying roll and roll again. The winner of that roll gets to attack, and the defender loses their defenses. Using magic operates on the same principal.nnnnBasically, each level continues like this until you either die, or you reach the cave where the boss resides. Then you can go back to the castle, buy some gear, and get your next assignment, until you finish the game.nnnnIf you're looking for an NES role-playing game that's a welcome departure from Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy clones, this game is right up your alley.

This frenetic shoot-'em-up taxes the Famicom system and the player's reflexes with huge quantities of enemies while maintaining smooth, fast gameplay!  In addition to a single player campaign, there are also score attack and time attack modes available.

	The object of Super Arabian is to collect all the pots on the screen, while avoiding pests like birds and worms who will block your way and eventually destroy you. If they do this, you can kick their Arabian butt and knock them off the screen. If you manage to kick two or more enemies at once, something will hit you that will make you invincible for a few seconds.
	.
	It doesn't matter about the order in which you collect the pots. However, each pot has a different letter on it, and if you collect the pots in the order that they appear at the top-right of the screen, you will receive a whopping 5000 points. After you collect the pots, you move on to the next level.  There are four levels in each part (section), and each part has a theme to them. In Part 1, Level 1, for instance, you have to collect the letters that make up the word ANIMAL. In subsequent levels, you have to create words that are actual animals (HORSE, RABBIT, MONKEY). Also, if you take too long to complete the level, a red genie will emerge from one of the pots and will attack you.

	Rumor says that the legendary Black Onyx, an artifact that grants eternal youth and happiness to those who can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro. You assemble a party of brave adventurers and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.
	.
	The Black Onyx is the very first RPG made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. You create a party (up to five members) and explore a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. You also meet adventurers whom you can convince to join your party. The combat engine is turn-based.

The standard enemies are similar to those in the originals, but they speed up when they reach the middle of the screen and never shoot. The level designs are considerably more basic than those in Contra and are mostly original, although the first half of Area 4 bears a strong resemblance to Area 4 from Super C.

	Super Contra X is a pirate based off the Contra series, created by Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co sometime in the 1990's. (Likely 1994).
	This isn't a complete clone of Contra or any games in the series, but instead tries to remake the engine and use it in completely different levels. Most of the weapons from that game are present, but function differently. The default gun is similar to the original, but sometimes pressing the fire button doesn't shoot a bullet when it's supposed to due to unresponsive controls. The machine gun fires slower and and doesn't allow you to fire while jumping. The spread gun only fires in three directions and the laser is more like the one from Contra 4 in that you can fire multiple shots on the screen at once and that the shots don't disappear when you fire repeatedly. Occasionally in certain spots, the player can die for no reason. Many consider the game to be incredibly difficult because of unresponsive controls and poor programming.

description:
	Super Donkey Kong - Xiang Jiao Chuan is a Donkey Kong Country bootleg for the Famicom. The developer is believed to be Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co with Liang Yi Productions as the publisher.
	While this game takes many elements from Donkey Kong Country, it's more of an original game than a port. The player can only choose to be either Donkey or Diddy Kong and you play through the whole game with only one. They lose a life after three hits as opposed to one as shown in the top left. (Which is not displayed anywhere on the HUD.) A jumps and the B button lets the character perform their attack (unlike the original, doing it while standing doesn't cause you to move), run, and pick up and throw barrels. The game is notorious for its controls: the jumping is considered to be awkward because jumping causes the Kong to move at a running pace and the player can only turn around when at the peak of the jump while jumping forwards, which makes it difficult to do precision jumps. Another issue is holding B doesn't automatically make you run; you need to complete your attack before you begin running. It's also been noted that the Kongs themselves feel rather slippery when attempting to stop, especially when running.

Despite the name, it has no relation to Mario at all. (with the exception of the main character being an edit of Mario from Super Mario Bros.).
	The gameplay is very simple. You're a man and you have to go after the woman running around on the screen. At the same time, you have to avoid the dog that is chasing you around. After grabbing the woman, you are awarded a scene of her stripping or posing. Later, your character and the woman also begin to lose their clothes during gameplay. If you grab the woman for the second time, the game will display an erotic animation of the woman in sexual practices. After that, you have to repeat the whole process again. There are currently four erotic animations within the game.

So now it's up to Commander Ralph to travel in time through six distinct time periods in the Neo Final Star space patroller and finally figure what exactly caused Gordess to come into existence.
	Gameplay involves flying in a vertically scrolling shooter defeating various enemies in order to collect time pieces. Time pieces can be spent at teleporters so that the player can travel to different time periods and also these time pieces can be spent at shops in order to buy equipment.
	The player can also find buildings to enter into. The game turns from being a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up to an isometric dungeon exploration shooter. The main objective in these areas is to locate one of the seven time stones.

	WCW: World Championship Wrestling is an isometric  wrestling game of the National Wrestling Alliance.
	Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"), Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.
	.
	Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.

Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

	"Sweet Home" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre, created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However, "Sweet Home" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.

	The game was never released outside of Japan.

	On the surface Takeshi no Ch?senj? is a side-scrolling adventure game, where the player character can wander the streets and buildings of Tokyo, and later the islands of the South Pacific. Various people and shop-owners can be spoken with, and frequently attacked if the player so chooses.nnnnKitano incorporated many of his unique and controversial ideas into the game. For instance, the player can beat up a yakuza gangster at a pachinko gambling establishment, and take the yakuza's money to exchange for prizes. The player can use a hang-glider to fly over into a strange land called the "Red Country" (an amalgam between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany). The player can gain access to the Red Country if they pass over the four other islands, but a huge mountain blocks the way into the country, and the player will be forced to crash into either the mountain or the ground, resulting in an automatic game over screen. There is also a choice on the password-entry screen ("Punch the old man") which results in an automatic game over, even when the player has not even started the game. Other in-game events include: a game over screen where the player's character is given a funeral, singing karaoke at a pub (using the second-controller's built-in microphone), the main character divorcing his wife and paying a settlement, beating up yakuza, or even punching the main character's wife and children (presumably to death).nnnnThe game's plot, where a despondent salaryman seeks to find a hidden treasure on an island, is introduced as having been created by Kitano while he was drunk at a bar; however, Kitano himself explains that the plot was solely the result of an hour-long talk at a caf√© near his production company

	Probably the first game to be based on the Transformers toys, Convoy no nazo pits the player as Ultra Magnus, who must find out the secret of Convoy (known as Optimus Prime in most of the world). To find it out, Ultra Magnus must travel through a set of platform-style worlds and fight a range of bosses, ranging from the Megatron, through the combiner series to a flying Decepticon emblem(!).
	.
	Ultra Magnus starts out in robot mode, where he can jump far but his shots travel only halfway across the screen. Press down, and Magnus transforms into a trailer. In trailer mode, he can pass below the planes as well as shoot upwards. When a plane is shot down, it transforms into a robot, which must be killed with the forward-pointing shot. Later on, the game becomes more platform-oriented.

	Tetrastar The Fighter is a 3D shooter by Home Data and published by Taito. In the year 2089, humanity forms an alliance with the intergalactic Baal empire but soon Earth finds out about the alien's true intentions. A group of resistance assembles the project Tetrastar to prepare for the potential upcoming threat. But the project lead by the general Nelson is soon put on hold and a short lived peace settles in. But the whole thing was nothing more than a hostile invasion and the Baal empire finally breaks the alliance and attacks Earth. The player's first mission is to prevent New York to be destroyed and then to retrieve Omega, the faithful robot navigator, to warp to the alien's mother world. The Tetrastar super fighter can move around the screen and fire a standard Vulcan gun. Special weapons become available later in the game from Bombs (WID), Homing Missiles (AAM), Napalm Bombs (NAP) and the powerful Bio Cannon (BIO) - they are accessible via the Select button and triggered by pressing A. They all come in limited quantities and must be refilled by picking up power-pods along the way. Tetrastar features nice stages and cutscenes between them unfold the game's episodic story.

description:
	This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.
	.
	The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.

	Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.
	.
	Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.
	.
	BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.
	.
	BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.

	Tetsuwan Atom is an action game developed by Home Data and published by Konami for the Famicom in Japan early on in 1988. The game stars Tetsuwan Atom, a popular early anime character who is better known as Astro Boy outside of Japan. Tetsuwan Atom was originally created in 1951 by Osamu Tezuka. The successful series started as a comic strip and was turned into a black and white animated series in 1963. It was one of the first (if not the first) animated TV series produced in Japan, and has influenced countless Japanese animated series that followed. The little robot-boy is one of Japan's most recognizable character. The story takes place in the future, at a time where humans and robots live together in harmony. The powerful robot-boy Atom lives with Professor Ochanomizu, an old scientist who takes good care of the little robot, and helps him fight crime and injustice. One day, burglars break into Professor Ochanomizu's lab and steal all of his money. It is now Atom's duty to recover the stolen loot.

Cute nasties which look like fantasy creatures run at him and must be shot down. Others come out of holes in the ground beneath collapsing platforms, and certain monsters will, when shot, run away from Tokoro-san and run down all monsters in their path. Shooting the pistol will use up the water reserve, which will decrease the range of the shots. Leaving enemies alone when possible is therefor a good strategy. When Tokoro-san enters a house, a boss battle must be run through before he can choose a path to other districts in the town. When the player is hit too many times by monsters, or the water pistol runs out of water, the game is over.

	Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:
	.
	1. Yellow: grants bonus points;
	2. White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
	3. Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
	4. Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
	5. Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.
	.
	The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.
	.
	One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.
	.
	In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.

	Third game in the Twinbee series of vertically-scrolling surreal cute 'em ups. Once again you take the role of either Twinbee or Winbee (Gwinbee having been kidnapped by the final boss) as they fly through the fantasy kingdom shooting the hell out of their... uhm... enemies, or whatever they are.
	.
	As in other games in the series you can gain power-ups after defeating certain amounts of enemies by shooting the magical bells they leave behind, depending on the amount of times you shoot them, they change color and thus give different power-ups such as multiple shots, options, etc.
	.
	If correctly powered-up both ships can join-up to perform a screen-clearing attack, and you can choose your starting stage from any of the first four stages (the fifth and last remaining locked until you clear all the others).

description:
	Space Defence Force SDF is a vertically scrolling space shooter. Though it scrolls vertically, you are granted some movement horizontal movement as well. The action isn't frantic, but the game is still somewhat difficult due to tight enemy attack waves and the possibility of being shot in the back. For this reason, you should not let enemies pass unscathed, since they may shoot back at you from off-screen. At some points, power up capsules will materialize in space. They will grant you not only greater firepower, but also serve as a reconfigurable armor, which is SDF's main selling point. The armor may be moved from your front to your back, and while it is moved in a large arc, it will destroy any enemies it happens to ram. When fastened to your rear, it will also grant a small speed boost. Learning to use the armor is the key to surviving in this game.

	Ultraman Club: Kaijuu Dai Kessen!! is an action platformer for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
	Ultraman Club: Great Kaiju Battle is a pretty simple platformer, typical of the NES era. You walk generally right/up and beat up various bad guys from the Ultraman franchise. You can also use sub-weapons and switch between them at will. Every once in a while you get a balloon popping minigame where you can win various prizes.
	One thing to keep in mind, though, is that several of the Ultramen look VERY similar, with the only real differences in their artwork being around the shoulder area. This can cause a bit of confusion as to who is speaking. Just remember that after beating a boss, Ultraman Zoffy speaks to your Ultraman, your Ultraman isn't talking to himself!
	After working out how text is formatted in this game, hacking it was fairly straight-forward, although the script had to be trimmed down to fit into the available space. The planet names in-between stages have proven difficult, though, so they have been left untranslated for the time being.

The games features standard side-scrolling stages where the player must reach the goal, as well as boss encounter where the player must compete in a mini-game such as concentration and shiritori. nnThe objective of the game is to reach the end of each action scene by making the best use of Wagan's sound wave attacks and jumping ability. The player must confront a boss at the end of certain stages, but instead of actually fighting the boss in battle, the player is challenged to a mini-game where they must score more points than their opponent. The graphics in this installment featured simple backgrounds with bright colors. The boss theme that was later used in Wagan Land 2 and Super Wagan Land was first used in this installment for the shiritori and concentration mini-games.

	Wagyan Land 2 plays pretty much identically to the first Wagyan Land. You're a cute green lizard dinosaur thing, and you walk to the right and shoot various syllables out of your mouth, which don't actually hurt enemies. They just remain frozen for a certain period of time, depending on how powered-up your attack is. Once you get four power-ups you become invincible, and you can finally kill the damned things. Which doesn't happen often.
	So, how can you defeat the bosses with a crappy syllable that can't hurt anybody? Why you play minigames with them, of course! The whole game's pretty frustrating, with the whole ?one-hit-and-you-start-the-entire-level-over? thing that's so popular in the world of videogaming. Honestly, it's fun and all, but I don't understand why the game needed to have two sequels.
	While this isn't quite as polished as AlanMidas's translation of the first Wagyan Land game (the title screen, for instance, and the GYA syllables that he shoots out are left in Japanese), it's still all in English, and pretty damn fun to play. You can just pretend those projectiles are magical, uh, runes, or something.
	July 2009 Update
	The translation is incomplete. Another ending was left untranslated and was even removed if the patch is used (as the author's notes state so). The unofficial addendum released April 2008 only added additional graphics, but the ending is missing.

	A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.
	Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.
	Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.

	Based on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master.  Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment.  Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones.  Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy.

	This is an extremely hard action platform type game. This game is mostly similar to other Mario Bros run and jump variants we are familiar with. This game however, throws in a bit of a Castlevania type theme. You mostly travel upward and not side to side like most similar side scrolling games. This contributes to making the game more difficult than the others. It also has a added twist that you have to work your way around obstacles, lines of fire that come out the floor, and many other things. You collect keys, bombs, and other items of which I am not sure where you use them because I didn't make it that far. All in all it is a fun game, though a very challenging one.

	The player controls a boy named Tarosuke, who travels through "Jigoku" (the Japanese concept of Hell) fighting off "yokai" (mythical Japanese monsters) on his way to his final fate, as determined by Buddha. He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning "Monmotaro" (not to be confused with "Momotar√Ö "), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.

description:
	You are Adol (Aron in Sega Master System version) Christian, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day you encounter a fortuneteller who sends you on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long you learn that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in Sega Master System version, Malificus in PC version). It is your task to defeat the villain and to discover the secret of Ys!
	.
	Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the "attack" button, you simply run into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol's death if the monster is stronger than him. You gain gold and experience points for defeating your foes; once you have gained enough experience, you level up and become stronger. You can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.

	This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is...
	.
	This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: Book I & II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and inventory, like in any other RPG.

	Adol's long time friend, Dogi wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.  Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.
	.
	Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.

	Gameplay consists of the player dodging cars and other roadway hazards on their way to the next checkpoint. Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.

description:
	Zunou Senkan Galg ("Brain Battleship Galg"), referred to as just Galg by the game's title screen, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player must navigate a serious of canyon-like environments for missing pieces to a war machine. Each stage has at least one piece, so the player must visit them all in order to find the necessary number. In addition to this, there are numerous secrets hidden throughout the many stages of the game, and the player frequently has to choose between multiple paths which lead to different stages. The game advertises itself as a "RPG" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.
	Like The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.
	Though it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named "Team Bioteckers". Galg is their only known video game credit.
