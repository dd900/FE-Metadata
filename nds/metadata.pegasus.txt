	Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series. It is an interquel set between Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney.
	This game is a standard "point and click" adventure, with the player controlling Edgeworth's movements and what he interacts with. For each case, the goal is to collect evidence to determine who the perpetrator is, how the crime was committed and their motive. This is presented as a combination of a third-person view showing the characters at the crime scene and through animated close-up images of the characters, annotated by text dialog. In some cases, still images are used to highlight dramatic scenes.

	After arriving at the Animal Village, you try desperately to fit in and make friends.  After almost succeeding, a boxing gym opens and all the animals join up.  Looks like you'll have to take part, too.  Get ready to box!
	.
	Animal Boxing is a game that requires you to hold the Nintendo DS upside down to play.  The player uses the touch screen to punch in a variety of ways - tapping your opponent throws a standard punch, swiping horizontally throws a hook, and swiping upwards throws an uppercut.  By holding the stylus on-screen longer, you can charge power for a more powerful punch.  The Control Pad is used to dodge left and right, as well as block.
	.
	As your boxer takes and delivers hits, their Anger Meter increases.  When it is at its maximum, your boxer fills with rage, and all of their attacks become more powerful for a limited time.  This can be used to turn the tide in a match.  However, opponents can also use this tactic, meaning that blocking and dodging become very important during these moments!
	.
	As with other boxing games, your goal is to defeat your opponents in a series of bouts to win the championship belts.  Once you defeat the champion, you'll win the belt and progress to the next championship.  Each championship you win unlocks new animals to fight against in the Vs. Animal matches, as well as new items to decorate your boxer with.

	Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation in which the player can choose from 30 different underwater animals.  Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.
	.
	And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fish in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.
	.
	Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.

	Arctic Tale is based on the National Geography documentary of the same name. Players control a polar bear (both cub and adult) trying to survive in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are eleven stages where the little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and additional chapters. Later, two other animals can be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale.
	.
	The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. These games include Ice Slide (obstacle course), Shuffle (slide to the center of a ring), Food Fight, Ice Flow Rodeo (control a broken piece of ice through rough currents), Survive the Cold (cross an icy area using shelters to hide from the cold), Catch-a-Seal, Ice Sheet, Clam Scavenge (find eight hidden clams), Herd Flow (guide an ice block without hitting anything), Walrus Hunt, Orca Race and more.

	As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level, etc.)
	.
	The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.
	.
	The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.
	.
	The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.
	.
	In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)
	.
	The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.

	Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end.  Choosing between a male or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade.  Everything in the world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.
	.
	Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space.  Think of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus.  For example, elemental properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice.  Removing codes from enemies allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.
	.
	Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves.  Additionally, the player can begin a Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem bonuses.  Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.

	Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.
	.
	Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.
	.
	The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.
	.
	With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels.

Serving is done through the stylus by matching the correct colours, but Betty also has to keep an eye on the crowd kept outside by doorman Gorilla and the rest the band needs between songs.
	.
	When the first shift is completed, Betty enters the stage to perform. A bar of notes is shown on the top screen and players need to select the corresponding notes in the correct order on the bottom screen to wow the audience.
	.
	By doing well through both shifts, a gold star is awarded. It can be used in the following shifts to trigger the power mode where Betty uses her charm to entertain all guests at once. Customers such as Snobby Sally, Goons, Lazy Bones, Slobs, Critics and Military boys all have different characteristics and needs that are to be taken into account.

	Help the Biker Mice From Mars, Vinnie, Modo, and Throttle, in their quest to save planet Mars from destruction with the help of the Regenerator, a machine that can create water for the Martians to continue to survive with.  With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue Stoker, who can help them create another.
	.
	Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up.  Take the role of Vinnie, Modo or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars.  During the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the track), or boost ahead of opponents.  You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the track before time is up.  Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.
	.
	The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward.  You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with punches and kicks as you progress.  The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat them before you can move on.  The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.

	Bomberman Land Touch! is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (Bomberman being the first game) and it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.
	.
	In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green.
	.
	Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and challenge you to it.
	.
	In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one, all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.

	Bubble-blowing dragons Bub and Bob return (now with buddy Bubu in tow) for a more traditional 2D platform romp than earlier DS title Bubble Bobble Revolution, still however retaining some of its gameplay innovations.
	.
	The basic gameplay is as has lasted the test of time: expelling bubbles from their mouths, the adorable dragons first incapacitate monsters by enveloping them in bubbles, then put them out of commission by popping the containing bubble (replacing the enemy with a tasty piece of fruit!) -- each level ending with every enemy popped, through ten worlds of ten levels each with a boss fight at the end of each world.  A trapped monster, if left unpopped, will eventually free itself, now red, angry, fast and aggressive, and if it takes too long for the dragons to clean up a level, the notorious invincible ghost whale "Baron von Blubba" appears to turn up the heat.
	.
	Things escalate in complexity quite quickly, however, considering that each dragon blows a different colour of bubble -- and that some enemies (designated by colour-coded stars) can only be trapped by certain-coloured bubbles.  (Complicating things further, some enemies need to be trapped by combinations of two differently-coloured bubbles before they're down for the count.  These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)
	.
	An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of the new star bubble type.
	.
	When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.

Shanoa, a young acolyte of the Order, is chosen for her extraordinary magical abilities to wield Dominus: the ultimate spell against evil. As she is about to complete the ritual to absorb Dominus a rogue acolyte named Albus steals the three tomes containing the spell.

	Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens. The top screen is used to show the gameplay, while the bottom one shows statistics such as the remaining time, the score, the type of gun and the remaining ammo. The game can be controlled through the buttons, or in combination with the stylus to aim at the chickens.
	.
	The basic game modes are identical to those of the Wii version: Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground). Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic). There are six levels/environments: The Village, The Forest, Nevada Desert, Antarctica, Rocky Island and Sahara.
	.
	There are two multi-player modes: cooperative gameplay for two players or a four-player competitive game mode where players need to score as much points as possible in a set amount of time.

	What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.
	.
	Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle.
	.
	The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely.
	.
	The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.

description:
	When a mysterious alien being arrives on planet Skyla, the planet's inhabitants tried to make peace with it.  However, its intentions were anything but... destroying all in its wake and forcing the planet's inhabitants to flee as none of their weapons could even harm it.  Study revealed that the alien was able to exist in two different times simultaneously, and could only be harmed in both.  A special time machine was built - one that can transport someone into the past and the present at the same time...
	.
	Chronos Twin is a side-scrolling platform game with a difference - the action takes place on both Nintendo DS screens simultaneously.  The top screen shows the player in the present, while the touch screen shows the player in the past.  Pressing the A Button will make both the past and present player jump simultaneously.  While there are certain differences in the past and the present (for example, a platform in the past may not exist in the present), as long as the player is standing on the platform in one time period, they won't fall.
	.
	The player also has a weapon at their disposal - a gun which can be fired in the present with the X Button, and the past with the B Button.  However - the gun cannot be fired in both time periods simultaneously.  The gun can also be charged up by holding down the button, releasing a more powerful blast.
	.
	After a certain point in the game, the player is also able to stop time in one period while moving about freely in another period.  This can be used to move blocks to allow both present and past players to get through, or to release platforms that a player in one time period couldn't reach.

	.
	The game is made of 15 chapters, and each chapter is split into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D point-and-click adventure, where you take control of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to people, gather items, and generally watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap among characters and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world. Occasionally, the player has to solve touch-screen puzzles and pass vehicle-based levels.

	Color Cross is a picture puzzle game similar to Picross, where the objective is to fill all the correct cells in a grid to form a picture. Each row and column has a series of numbers as clues, indicating the groups of continuous cells that must be painted. The player must use logic to discover the remaining spots and complete the figure.
	.
	The main difference this time is the addition of multiple colors per picture, instead of the monochromatic approach of other titles. Players can select back and forth between colors by clicking on the palette at the side of the screen. Cells can be painted individually or as a group by clicking and dragging across them with the cursor. In each color option, cells can be marked with an X to point them out as incorrect places. Any mistakes are corrected automatically, affecting the final score.
	.
	New levels are unlocked with each completed picture. They are organized by picture theme at the level selection menu. Every time a line or column is completed, the clue numbers become grayed out and a shower of candies, fairies and other theme-related items fall from it to the bottom of the screen.

He and his assistant, Terry, have crash-landed on an unknown island, and the professor needs to make repairs to his ship.  Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to help them both.

	Contact is an adventure game with a difference.  The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his assistant, Terry, is not.  You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to him.  Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them frequently.  Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase.  Take damage, and while your health will decrease, your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits.  Steal items and your thievery skills will increase, and so on.
	.
	The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into their copy of the game.

	Similar to The Incredible Machine the player needs to use animated parts to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption and solve puzzles by doing so.
	.
	The game features three different modes: Classic, Arcade or Construction Kit. The classic mode requires the player to place the parts and manually activate the machine to get the ball to it's goal, the arcade mode confronts the player with an already finished and running machine which needs a little help. By using the stylus or blowing into the microphone the player not only moves the ball through the experiment but also activates and uses the parts of the machine. By successfully completing all those puzzles, the player unlocks additional components which are then at his disposal in the construction kit to freely construct anything he wants without a time or space limit.
	.
	Although the game doesn't feature a traditional multiplayer-mode, the players can trade their experiments with friends over the wireless connection.

	The fifth game in the Custom Robo series, Custom Robo Arena moves the action into the portable realm again with the first entry on the DS. It is the first in the series to be released in PAL territories, and the second in North America.
	.
	The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.
	.
	In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.

	These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.
	.
	Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4 basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.
	.
	The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.

The INKT Corporation. as before, manages to drain all colour from the city and also turns its inhabitants, the Raydians, into generic drones. Once again, it is up to Blob and the members of the Colour Underground to restore the city to its vibrant former glory. Blob frees the lands one by one, as he did in the last game, fighting against many foes, including a massive monster created in a factory accident, as he approaches Comrade Black. Black, however, is shown to be more clever than was suggested in the previous game. At one point, he kidnaps the other members of the Color Underground. Once De Blob frees all of Prisma City, he confronts Comrade Black again, only to discover, as he flees to space once again, that Black had used Blob's own journey against him, using color beacons that were mysteriously activated as Blob progressed to power an orbiting satellite to enslave the entire planet. As Blob gets closer and closer, Black taunts him and forces him to make a series of choices: continue on, or rescue a few Graydians that Black had placed in biodomes rigged to explode and risk running out of time. Once Blob finally reaches him, Black uses a high-power beam of color to grow gigantic and fight Blob.

	Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS.
	The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the game’s attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep Labyrinth’s magic system requires the player to draw symbols – Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique symbols.
	.
	The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.
	.
	In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As it’s getting late, and a storm is approaching Shawn and the family pet – dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out – Shawn’s parents’ memories of him and each other are scheduled for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world of memories.
	.
	The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.
	.
	The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.

description:
	When Tiger Island is taken over by the evil Wizpig, Timber sends a letter to Diddy to request his assistance.  Diddy, Dixie, Tiny Kong and the rogue Kremling Krunch turn up to help Timber and his friends, Bumper, Tiptup and Pipsy.
	.
	Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  However, while the story and setting remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port.  Players can still race around assorted tracks around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating bosses to confront Wizpig.
	.
	There have been subtle tweaks to the gameplay.  While you can still level up your balloons by collecting another of the same colored balloon in a row, collecting a different colored balloon will not change your weapon - you'll have to fire your current weapon first.  The Silver Coin Challenge from the original game has been removed from the main adventure, and is replaced with a first-person touch screen shooter where you fly around on Taj's magic carpet and aim to pop as many balloons as you can.  There's also an optional racing mode where you race by using the stylus to guide the vehicle through a top-down map.
	.
	The game now supports currency system for most unlockables - dotted along the track are coins, which can be used to buy 'wishes' from Taj the Genie.  These include anything from new characters, exclusive tracks, a custom track editor, battle modes to unlock in multiplayer and so forth.  The DS version of Diddy Kong Racing also heavily supports multiplayer.  You can play with one game card or multiple game cards (to a maximum of eight players), or online to a maximum of six players.  Similar to Mario Kart DS, you can design your own custom decal and have it as your visual representation for when you race around the world.

Along the way, you will have to complete dozens of quests which you discover by interacting with your Digimon.

Play the role of a student wizard at the College of Runes and battle other students to see who is the best, fighting teachers and then ultimately fight a secret boss. Players use the stylus to draw shapes 'magical runes' on the DS touch screen, which then travel towards your opponent on the other side of the playing area. In the playing area is a circular drawing board on which you draw runes that activate your spells, assuming there is currently enough mana to do so. Once cast, a little icon starts moving anti-clockwise around the board, up towards an image of the opponent (at the 12 o'clock position). If it hits your opponent the effects of the spell are manifested, whether it's simply inflicting damage, cursing them with effects.
	.
	Both players players have a shield which can be activated by pressing their own icon (at the six o'clock position). The shield only last few a few seconds before needing to recharge and some spells are able to cut through it, so players need to keep an eye on not only which spells are traveling towards them, but how their spells are likely to be received by their opponent. Tactics are used to combine these runes both in timing and effect.

	Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 gameplay follows closely to its predecessor. Players explore areas and tame wild monsters into their party. Monsters fight in turn-based combat and grow stronger. The battle system itself is very similar to previous Dragon Quest Monsters games. The player controls up to three monsters that make up the party, and can issue them direct orders or set them to one of 4 AI settings. This game features two new monster sizes: large monsters, which use up two spaces on one of the player's two benches, and gargantuan monsters, who take up an entire bench on their own. The main character, who is henceforth referred to as the Hero, does not directly participate in battles except for when the player uses items. He can, however, use any item in his possession and not just the ones 'in hand'. 311 monsters from the Dragon Quest games appear in Joker 2, with a few new species, many from the original "Dragon Warrior Monsters" games. This is the second game in the series to feature Wi-Fi support, after the first Joker game, and the first to support direct battling between players.
	Square Enix released Joker 2 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on March 31, 2011. Professional features over 100 new monsters, as well as new regions and abilities, but the same story. Players are able to import their old monsters from the original game.

	In the beginning, the Creator built the world and left its people, the lighthearted Raposa, his blueprint -- The Book of Life.
	.
	It's been nearly a generation since the Raposa have been in contact with the Creator, and most assume he's left them to take care of themselves.  Still, the time has passed peacefully, and the Raposa lived in relative happiness and comfort.
	.
	However, the Book of Life has been stolen, and a madman has been reshaping the world according to his own whims.  Most of the Raposa have moved away, looking for safer lands, and those who remain plead for the Creator to return and save them from the darkness, which has crept across their village.
	.
	As the Creator, your job is to rebuild your fragmented world, and recover the now missing pages of the Book of Life.  Use your stylus and draw your own hero to platform his way to saving the Raposa's world. Along the way, draw your own platforms, vehicles, and all manner of other things. It's up to you to bring color back into the darkened landscape.
	.
	The player's character can be drawn for various elements such as torso, head, arms and legs with different color schemes. In the village shop, games, songs, patterns and moves can be bought to travel through the world with 2D-platformer gameplay.

	Drawn to Life Collection is a compilation game including Drawn to Life and Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter.
	.
	Drawn to Life is a 2D game where the player must draw their own character, weapons and accessories, platforms, and objects.
	.
	The main "race" of creatures inhabiting the universe of Drawn to Life are anthropomorphic fox-like beings known as the "Raposa" ("Raposa" means "fox" in Portuguese). They were drawn by the Creator, who also drew their world and everything upon it. But the Creator abandoned the Raposa long ago.
	.
	The story begins with a Raposa named Mari crying out to the player, the Creator, to help save the village she lives in. Along the way, you meet her best friend, Jowee, and her father, the Mayor. These characters are the last remaining villagers. You design a hero for them, and then run into Wilfre, a corrupted Raposa that dabbled in creation, and spawned a legion of evil shadow-like creatures.
	Will you be able to save the Raposa race and their village, or will the shadow creatures take over the whole village?
	.
	Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter follows the same concept as the first game, taking place after an unkown amount of time following the first game.
	.
	The game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of "that day", though at this time, the player is not aware of the event's importance (or even occurrence). Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core "draw" functionality.
	.
	Following this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters realize she's missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as Heather's captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the Creator.
	.
	Their numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the Raposa's struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the Creator's Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong, Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre's Wasteland, a combination of all three villages.

description:
	In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes, lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.
	.
	The story tells of a TV weatherman by the name of Marty Storm  who is fired from his job for reporting the truth about bad weather conditions instead of lying about good weather conditions in which the station's producer hopes will result in better ratings.  Afterwards he vows revenge as his former co-workers ridicule him, unknown to them however, Marty Storm is also a part-time mad scientist that has created a device that can create disasters at will.  With this device, Storm goes on a quest to bring the city and his former co-workers to their knees.  The gameplay is divided into three weeks (levels) which have seven days, each with their own set of goals.  Some consist of causing a set amount of damage, others consist of destroying a certain percentage of building while others consist of destroying certain buildings.  These objectives must be done within a certain time limit.
	.
	To conjure these storms a menu is on the right side of the bottom screen which has a list of disasters available (some are only available on certain days).  After selecting their disaster they use the stylus pen to create a path of destruction for the tornadoes and storms or pick a certain point for either the earthquake or meteors.  For the storms and tornadoes, players can click onto them with the stylus and continue to change their path until the run out.  Additionally, the player must have a certain amount of energy to be able to select them which regenerates over time or can be obtained by destroying buildings.  To help the player, a mini-map is also located at the top of the screen which shows locations of buildings, which types of buildings they are and the buildings health status.
	.
	Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster.  The tornado becomes much more powerful and has the ability to cause more damage.  The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them.  The ice storm causes a blizzard which will weaken buildings for other storms.  The earthquake will become more powerful when the player continually taps the center of the earthquake with the meteor storm has the same effect.
	.
	However there are attempts to halt the players progress which certain buildings that can instantly stop the players selected disaster.  A tornado trapper can suck up a tornado while a cloud cruncher takes out lightning and ice storms.  The seismic nullifer prevents earthquakes while the meteor shield keeps meteors from destroying buildings and the weather sucker stops both tornadoes and storms.  The storm free zone building prevents any disaster from being performed around it and a weather repeller bounces storms and tornadoes off of them.  There are also two types of drones that come in from time to time: a repairing drone will fly around and repair a building while a rebuilding drone will instantly bring a building back without any time to rebuild it.  The player can use the lightning storm to hover above these drones and destroy them.
	.
	Power-ups are also scattered throughout the level which will upgrade their storm or disaster to the next level for a brief amount of time.  To use these power-ups, the player must have their storm or disaster consume them, however the color much match the disaster that is being used, otherwise the power-up will have no effect.
	.
	There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players.  A race mode lets players complete a certain set of objectives given to them with the winner being the first player to complete them.  There is also a Tug-of-War where the main objective is to either have the largest amount of destruction monetary wise or through a certain percentage.

	Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!  In this rhythm-based music game, the Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the power of song.
	.
	The game is played entirely through use of the stylus.  Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song.

	Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.
	.
	Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth.  At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes.  You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must.  As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall.  Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it.  Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right).  Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.  During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth.  Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.
	.
	The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps.  The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area.  In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps.  This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are.  It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map.  However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon.  Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives.  Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.

	Fantasy Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation. Contrary to Aquarium by DS by the same developer, which is limited to "normal" aquarium suiting fishes, the player of this game can choose from 30 different underwater animals which can't be held in fish tanks in real life (e.g. whales, dolphins, sharks, penguins). Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.
	.
	And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fishes in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank, for example killer whales and penguins at the same time, will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.
	.
	Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.

	In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS, finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.
	.
	Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.
	.
	Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.
	.
	Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.

	Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West.
	.
	Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.
	.
	It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc.
	.
	Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.

	A second retelling of the original Fire Emblem on the Famicom, Shadow Dragon utilises the Nintendo DS online options in a first for the long running Fire Emblem series.
	The game offers a graphical enhancement from Ankoku Ry? to Hikari no Ken and Monsh? no Nazo, which was the first remake of the original, as well as utilising the dual screens on the Nintendo DS to display the action and character stats simultaneously.
	The main story centres on prince Marth as he embarks on a quest to reconquer his home kingdom and rescue his kidnapped sister. Characters and chapters that were not present in the original have been introduced in this version, as well as some that were omitted for Fire Emblem: Monsh? no Nazo. Over twenty character classes are included in the game as well as over fifty individual characters to aid Marth.
	Also included is the ability to save mid battle on special save point so a mistake in the last turn will not force a restart. Other features are the class swap for characters to change their abilities. Online battle features up to five characters per side in a two player battle.

	The story of New Mystery of the Emblem remains from the original version. The game is set on the continent of Archanea, a land also featured in the first Fire Emblem title Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. In Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, the land was threatened by the dark sorcerer Gharnef, who summoned the dark dragon Medeus into the world. After becoming a fugitive from his kingdom after an attack on his kingdom, Archanean prince Marth went on a quest to reclaim his kingdom and defeat Gharnef and Medeus. By the events of New Mystery of the Emblem, Marth's old ally Hardin has ascended the throne, but begins expanding the military and dominating the other regions of Archanea. Marth investigates, and discovers that both Gharnef and Medeus are still alive, and Hardin has been corrupted by them.[4]
	A new sub-plot introduced in New Mystery of the Emblem involves the inclusion of the Avatar and a group of assassins sent by Gharnef to kill Marth and his allies. The assassins initially send a spy named Katarina to infiltrate Altea as a new recruit, where she befriends the Avatar and the other members of her squad before revealing her true purpose and launching an attack on Marth. The recruits prevent the attack while Katarina escapes, and the Avatar is appointed as Marth's personal bodyguard to protect him from future assassinations and accompanies him during the war against Archanea as "The Hero of Shadow".

However, this proves to be too much even for him, and he slowly falls asleep and his nightmare begins.
	Garfield suddenly wakes up in a haunted castle; rather than the real world, he has entered a strange dream world populated by the monsters of Garfield's sub-conscious. To make things even worse, Garfield smashed his alarm clock in the real world, and now his only chance at waking up soon depends on his ability to find the shattered pieces and put them back together.

Rather than a third person chase camera perspective, the DS version uses a top-down perspective for most of the game. The story is the same as the other versions but the Ghostbusters receive side missions as well as story missions which they can use to boost the populace's opinion of them. Unlike the other versions in this there is no rookie character and the player takes control of the four original Ghostbusters one at a time while issuing commands to the other three. The money earned from missions can be used to buy new equipment and take part in the resource management aspect of the game. Also, between the game hub of the Firehouse & the missions, there are driving segments which uses a chase camera perspective where the player takes Ecto-1 from location to location, catching ghosts along the way.

	Giana Sisters DS is a modern 2009 remake of the cult game The Great Giana Sisters from the year 1987. The original game appeared on the C64 and Amiga, but had to be pulled from the shelves after Nintendo threatened to sue over similarities to the Super Mario games. Surprisingly, more than 20 years later the sisters make an appearance on the Nintendo DS.
	.
	Giana Sisters DS is a classic platformer. Giana is caught in a dream world and must now recover her lost diamonds and find a way to the mysterious castle. The game features more than 80 new levels (i.e. is not a one-to-one remake). There are also new special items that make use of the features of the DS. Giana can, for example, collect a bubble gum item that can be activated using the touch screen. The bubble enables Giana to fly and is controlled by blowing into the microphone. Another new feature is a world map that allows the player to select and replay levels.

	The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.
	.
	The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.
	.
	Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.

	Gormiti: The Lords of Nature! features characters and locations from the popular Gormiti TV show co-produced by Marathon Media & Giochi Preziosi. The action starts as a character named Razzle, while cleaning the library, accidentally knocks some old books into a Portal. These books tumble down to the 'Island of Gorm' where a never ending battle is going on between vast armies inspired by the elemental forces of nature. The books eventually land at the feet of Magmion, the evil Lava Gormiti. Magmion reads the book and learns of an old legend which talks about reuniting five sacred amulets which have been scattered across Gorm. Once reunited these amulets allow the holder to open an inter-dimensional portal to Earth! The Lords of Nature need to use all their unique powers to hinder Magmion's plans and save Earth. The game recreates the beautifully illustrated island of Gorm, where the Lords of Earth, Sea, Air and Forest are charged with stopping the evil Magmion from wreaking havoc.

	Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film.

	Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells.
	.
	The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you.  Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.

On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.
	.
	The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.

	Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.
	.
	The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.
	.
	The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.

description:
	Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The NDS version, by A2M, is the most different one.
	.
	The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.
	.
	The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.
	.
	As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.
	.
	In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.

	Jump Ultimate Stars is more or less an expanded version of the original game, Jump Super Stars. It features the same Super Smash Bros.-style fighting gameplay with a plethora of licensed manga characters, bringing in a wide variety of new franchises and characters. The roster has been expanded to more than 300 characters from 41 different manga titles. There is also Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support, making global internet play a possibility.

	The DS version on Justice League Heroes, while not following the plot of its console brethren, has a similar premise where you play as a member of the titular super-hero team and travel to a number of locations where hordes of enemies run amok.
	.
	The game is played with a top-down view of the environment on the lower screen and a map on top.  The map displays the location of your next checkpoint and the positions of the enemies along with the status of your characters.  The lower screen, in addition to the action, has various function icons that can be activated with the stylus.
	.
	There are about a dozen missions broken into about forty sections.  Before each, you must pick two heroes from the line-up of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash.  Each has regular melee attacks, strong melee attacks, a ranged attack and a unique super-power move. They must use these abilities to defeat many enemies and move to the next checkpoint, completing objectives such as switch-flipping and item collection along the way.  You may swap between your two heroes at any time by tapping an icon on the screen.  Another icon lets you call in an AI-controlled hero for brief support.  There are six of these to choose from: Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Huntress.  Each of these has a unique ability based on their powers.
	.
	In addition to the main game, there are two minigames and a third can be unlocked by inserting Justice League Heroes: The Flash into the GBA slot.

description:
	A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.
	.
	Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.
	.
	Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.
	.
	The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into another.

	In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.
	.
	Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.
	.
	Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to progress.

In addition, the Nintendo DS version offers an addictive card game called "Five-Card Fu," which can be played either alone or with a friend. The game is played on a 3x3 grid which contains nine squares. To get started, the player must select five cards from their in-game library and place one card in one of the nine squares. Each card will have a number ranging from one through nine on each side of the card. In order to win, the player must strategize on which square they will occupy first as well as which card to use. Once the player places a card in a square, the opponent will have to place a card on an adjacent square that beats the numerical value of the card the first player placed. The player that occupies the grid with the highest numerical value wins.

	Labyrinth is the sequel to a SNES game called On the Ball.  The object of the game is to manipulate a ball through a maze to the checkered goal line.    To do this, players must rotate the level around to navigate their way through obstacles.  The ball is constantly falling towards the bottom of the screen, ignoring whatever direction the maze is facing.
	.
	There are two ways to control the ball.  The first is by using the L and R Shoulder buttons to rotate the maze left or right.  The other method is to rotate the maze map on the touch screen using the stylus.  Players can also briefly surround their ball with lightning which will shatter certain blocks.  It's also possible to customize your ball - you can increase or decrease the weight of your ball, as well as change the colour and material it is made from.
	.
	In addition to the single player mode, Labyrinth also features a Single-Cart Multiplayer mode.  In this mode, up to four players can take part in making their way through the maze.  The first player to reach the goal is the winner.

	Two of gaming's all-time classics are reborn on DS. Stories tell of a land of yore, now shrouded by centuries of time forgotten, called Ys. Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.

	While being transported to the Iga village, the secret princess Kirihime is kidnapped by the evil Yoshiro Yukikusa, commander of an evil demon army. Kage and Chihiro are ninjas from the Iga village, and are sworn by their loyalty to do all they can to rescue her. They must face Yoshiro's endless demon ninja army on their quest across Japan.
	.
	As ninjas, Kage and Chihiro make use of a variety of ninja equipment and abilities. Kage uses katana and shuriken, while Chihiro uses a kusarigama (a chain with a blade on the end). Between stages, the player can arrange orbs they've collected on a grid to create different ninjutsu, or ninja magic. These have a variety of uses, including elemental attacks, damage reduction, and quicker attacks. New skills are also regularly learned, such as combination moves and new attacks, as well as increased jump height (in keeping with the absurd jumps the original game is known for).
	.
	After clearing the game, a hard mode is unlocked. There is also an art gallery featuring production illustrations, unlocked by meeting various conditions in the game.

Spyro and Cynder are tethered together with mysterious green energy chains created by the Dark Master before being carried away while Sparx is found by Hunter of Avalar, who was watching them from the shadows. Meanwhile, Spyro and Cynder find themselves in a dark, volcano like area. When they try to leave, they find out that they cannot as they are chained to the platform they awoke on. After defeating several waves of Grublins and avoiding an earth Golem that attacks them soon after, Spyro and Cynder manage to escape the Catacombs with the help of Hunter, who is with Sparx. After reaching safety in Twilight Falls, Hunter reveals to Spyro, Cynder and Sparx that the Dark Master, Malefor, had returned to the realm shortly after the events of The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night and has covered the land in darkness ever since.

	Continue the Wind Waker adventure in Link's first DS game.
	The epic story of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker continues as Link finds himself lost and alone in unknown seas in a new adventure. Featuring intuitive touch-screen controls and innovative puzzles, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass offers new challenges for fans of the series and an easy-to-grasp introduction for gamers new to The Legend of Zelda. But time grows short, and only the Phantom Hourglass can buy Link the minutes he'll need to survive.
	Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy's voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra and his way back to the seas he once knew.

	? Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time
	The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.
	? Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he?s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.
	? When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.
	? Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.
	? As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.

	The handheld Nintendo versions of LEGO The Lord of the Rings (based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, and in turn based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books) follow the same storyline as its home console cousins, where players must help Frodo Baggins and his friends travel from their peaceful home in the Shire to the perilous Mount Doom to destroy a powerful ring created by the antagonistic Sauron.
	Like various LEGO games, players control a variety of characters using the control pad (as well as the 3DS Circle Pad) across several levels in an open-world environment, completing a set of quests along the way. Players also need to utilise special items like the Light of Eärendil, Elven rope and a wide arrange of weaponry to defeat several enemies (especially in the dark region of Mordor).
	Unlike previous LEGO games, character biographies are also scattered throughout the levels that give players general summaries for each unique character. Red Bricks are also scattered and can unlock special abilities with the Extras menu.
	While the slapstick humour is absent in these games, the 3DS and DS versions still retain the family-friendly approach as the home console versions.

description:
	Fairy Tale Land faces its greatest crisis yet! A plague has swept through the population, turning former upstanding citizens into blood-crazed zombies.
	.
	Fortunately, the world's greatest adventurer and weapons collector, Little Red 'Ready To Rock' Riding Hood is still unaffected and is determined to uncover the source of the disease. She teams up with Momotaro, the boy who emerged from a peach in the Japanese folk tale, and the two set out on their quest. Red has her trusty machine gun and Momotaro has his ninja stars. They'll take down anything, living or dead, that gets in their way.
	.
	Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is a classic, arcade-style vertical shooter for one player. The action is viewed from a high angle, with visuals taking up both screens of the DS. The game world is presented in 3D, as are bosses and various other enemies. However, the main character and standard zombies are 2D sprites.
	.
	The player's character (either Red or Momotaro, neither of whom has any obvious advantage over the other) is situated at the bottom of the lower screen and waves of zombies march toward her/him. The character automatically moves forward through the world, but the player can control left/right movement along a 2D plane, enabling them to move out of the way of obstacles, projectiles and zombies.
	Touching the stylus to any point on the screen causes the character to shoot in that direction, and shots can be fired along the entire length of the play area (i.e. to targets at the top of the DS's upper screen).
	The standard machine gun has infinite ammo, but must be reloaded, which simply means taking the stylus off the screen for a second. Along the way, there are other weapons to pick up - a shotgun, laser rifle and flamethrower (hence the 'BBQ' of the title). These special weapons have limited ammo, so must be conserved.
	Players also start with a grenade launcher, which can be launched by double-tapping an area on the screen. Ammo is strictly limited, but can be replenished.
	.
	There are 21 levels, split over seven chapters. Each chapter is set in a different location based on a fairy tale or classic story and consists of two regular levels (fighting through hordes of zombies, as well as some mini-bosses) followed by a boss fight.
	.
	The boss fights are one of the game's main selling points, with varied and lengthy encounters against twisted, undead versions of Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Santa Claus and others.
	.
	By completing the game on higher difficulty levels, new gameplay modes can be unlocked, including Boss Attack (defeat every boss in sequence) and Survival (timed battle against waves of zombies).

description:
	Lock's Quest is a strategy / action / adventure game, for the Nintendo DS, that follows the adventurous life of a young "Archineer" named Lock (An Archineer is a mix between an architect and an engineer). Lock's village is attacked by an enemy known as the "Clockwork." During the invasion, the story is set in motion when Lock's little sister, Emi, goes missing. Lock, his new friend Isaiah, and Lock's grandfather Tobias set out in search for Emi. Along the way, Lock joins the Archineers and Kingdom Force in hopes of defeating the Clockwork army and their leader Lord Agony.
	.
	The game play consists of two main modes of play: "Build Mode" and "Battle Mode." In Build Mode, the player has a limited amount of time to build defenses that will stand up against the approaching Clockwork army. Each defensive object costs a certain amount of "Source" (the game's currency). Many levels have protection objectives that the player must defend and prevent from being destroyed by the Clockwork. The player can build walls and gates of various material types (Wood, Stone, Metal and Spiked), unique "Turrets" that automatically fire at approaching enemies, "Traps" that can be placed in the battlefield and stationary "Helpers" that give nearby turrets specific buffs. Each player can develop a personal strategy that best fits his play-style based off of the current terrain and his choice of defences. New abilities, enemies and areas are constantly unlocked as the player progresses through the entire game.
	.
	Battle Mode begins when the Build Mode timer runs out, or when the player chooses to advance to the battle. The player is thrown into a real time battle and must defend the protection objectives for a certain amount of time while holding off the attack. Other objectives include: destroying specific groups of enemies, capturing enemy objectives, rescuing friendly characters and destroying boss enemies. The battles involve controlling Lock directly with the Stylus as the enemies attack. The player may engage the Clockwork enemies in mêlée combat. Doing so brings up various mini games which can increase Lock's attack damage or add a status effect, such as poison, to the Clockwork. Lock may also repair walls and turrets which have been damaged. This also brings up a mini game where the player must use the stylus in a back and forth "ratcheting" motion to fix the wall. Not only is the player able to control Lock directly, but he can move the camera independently from the character. This control scheme allows flexibility for the player to focus on repairing or attacking in one area, while looking at what's going on in another area.
	.
	Lock's Quest is broken into 100 Build and Battle phases called "Days," covering a wide variety of areas and scenarios. The story is advanced through interactive free roam areas, villages and cinematic cut scenes which take place in between the battles. Plot twists and character development becomes the vehicle for pushing the game forward after the initial game play techniques are taught in an interactive tutorial. A multiplayer feature is also present in Lock's Quest using the wireless DS multi-card play. In this mode, two players compete head to head in a mix of Build and Battle modes where the players can choose the paths and type of clockworks their opponent will face.

However, soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.

	Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.
	.
	Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after.  Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.
	.
	The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.
	.
	The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.
	.
	At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.

	Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.
	.
	Gameplay[edit]
	The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]
	.
	Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.

	Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will O’ Wisp magical academy. When their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.
	.
	The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay.
	.
	As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the attack is extra effective.
	.
	There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.

description:
	Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.
	.
	A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.
	.
	Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.
	.
	Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.

	Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 shrinks the console game to fit on Nintendo's handheld. It is still in 3D and played on the upper screen. The lower screen is used to switch characters and use the star meter.
	.
	As with other versions, you play a squad of four characters at a time. You can switch between them at any time. There are shield points throughout the game where you can save and swap out characters.
	.
	Defeating enemies builds up a star meter. You can spend two stars to resurrect a fallen ally or all five to perform a powerful fusion attack where two characters combine their powers. Any pair of characters has their own unique fusion.
	.
	Defeating enemies also builds experience, which causes your characters to level up, increasing their powers and stats. Each character has four active and two passive powers and you can distribute the points however you wish or let the computer do it for you. Points can be reassigned at any time.
	.
	The story is told through 2-D cutscenes staged in the style of cardboard cutouts. It combines the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury uses superheroes in an unauthorized attack on Latveria, public sentiment turns against them. Then, after more than six hundred people are accidentally killed in a super hero fight, Congress passes the Super Human Registration Act, mandating all powered individual reveal their identity to the government. The game has you pick a pro or anti registration side. The beginning and end of the game are the same either way, but the middle section is different depending on which side you choose. The levels are mostly the same, but have different objectives. Several characters are restricted to each side and locked out if you play the other.

	Master of Illusion is different from other exercise games. This one is a take on magic, teaching the player but also performing magic tricks against the player itself. There are three different modes including Solo Magic, Magic Show and Magic Training.
	.
	In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as  guessing what card the player has just picked out or guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen.
	.
	In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone.
	.
	The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed. There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes with the game.

	Master of the Monster Lair is a dungeon crawling RPG with a different twist, whereas in previous dungeon crawlers the objective is to find the dungeons and monsters to clear them, the player creates the dungeon (or a monster lair in this case) in order to attract the monster and trap it to destroy it.  There are 23 different rooms to customize for the player's Monster Lair.
	.
	The story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens.  This is where the player takes control of an orphan called Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel.  After realizing his destiny, he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.
	.
	The view of the game uses the DS dual-screen technology, showing the world in the top screen while the bottom screen will show maps and item menus.  The gameplay is the standard turn-based RPG battle, selecting options from a menu such as attack and casting spells as well as the option to turn and run from the battle.
	.
	Players can pick up items and currency from monsters that are defeated in battle and use them to buy new weapons and armor for future battles or even furniture for Owen's house.  There is also wireless capabilities where players can view and exchange dungeons through Wi-Fi.

On the Wii, the player will use the nunchuk for player movement while the remote controls your marker. At any point the player can pause the action to draw their way out of sticky situations. Max, the game's hero, is a young boy who loves to draw. One day he receives a mysterious orange marker in the mail. As he begins drawing with the mysterious marker he quickly notices it has magical powers. Anything Max draws starts moving on the paper and comes to life. The monster he draws begins messing around with Max's artwork and so Max decides to draw himself into his picture and that is where the adventure begins.

The e-Reader cards that were exclusive to the Japanese version of Mega Man Zero 3 and provided in-game enhancements are now discoverable throughout that game as collectibles.  There is also the option to play through all four games in one continuous playthrough, rather than having to select each game individually.  Finally, an included "Easy Mode" makes the game more accessible to those not used to the game's tough difficulty level.

description:
	Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.
	.
	Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS.  While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.
	.
	As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities.  Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled.  New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies.  While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.

	Grey was a Reploid found in a hidden factory in suspended animation, accidentally awakened during battle.  Ashe was a human Hunter, chasing after treasures and bounties.  After their encounter with the evil Prometheus, they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious Biometal.  With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man!  But other people are after Model A as well...
	.
	Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX.  Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same.  The game itself plays much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X.  However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as their abilities.

description:
	Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).
	.
	Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.

	An episode in the Metroid Prime series which started on the GameCube, this game takes place between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is sent to the distant Alimbic Cluster by the Galactic Federation to investigate a message saying that the source of ultimate power lies in this desolate part of the galaxy, once home to an advanced culture.
	Samus is not alone, however. Other races have heard this mysterious message, too. Six other bounty hunters, each with unique characteristics, will do everything to get their hands on the Alimbic relics for their own reasons.
	The single-player mode is more focused on shooting than other Metroid games but also has puzzles in classic Metroid fashion. Unlike previous games, Samus has all her moves from the start, but she still has to look for weapons. The player may also run into other bounty hunters in this mode.
	The multiplayer mode is similar to Unreal Tournament or Quake games. Players can choose from any hunter that was defeated in single-player mode. There are seven modes in total including: Nodes, Survival, Bounty, Prime Hunter, Battle, Capture, and Defender. Each mode has its own unique rules. There are a vast number of arenas that can be played over local wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When using friend codes, voice chat before and after matches is enabled.

	Mixing miniature mayhem with maximum multiplayer racing, Micro Machines v4 features knockabout, breakneck racing in the fastest scale miniatures, complete with explosive weapon power-ups. Letting you loose with hundreds of vehicles, each with distinctive performance abilities, you'll be racing your inch-long miniature motors on the wildest tracks where everyday household objects appear immense in size and can become lethal hazards. Sport cars, street racers, stock cars, 4x4s, beach buggies, lowriders and muscle cars are just some of the Micro Machines models you'll be taking out on the improvised tracks around the Micro Machines house, garden and - for the first time - beyond. Spin out around the breakfast table littered with cereal spills, tear through the kitchen but avoid literally burning tyre rubber on the blazing hot cooker, turbo boost around the pool table (while avoiding the treacherous pockets), or hit the gas as you drive around the rim of the bath, carefully negotiating the ferocious waters pouring over the edge of the bath (because someone left the tap running).

After updating the Renegade Engine, used for the first game, Dementium, this new shooter for the DS puts you in the role of Major Edward Kane, Chief of Military Operations for the Extra-Terrestrial Encounter Organization. The year is 2058 and you and your squad are sent to the moon to investigate strange things that have been happening at the new moon bases. An alien hatch has been discovered at the construction site of one of the bases. So you need to take charge and take care of business.

The Rider Reflex control system provides unparalleled precision and fluidity by separating machine steering from body positioning, which allows the independently controlled rider to shift his weight, perform death-defying stunts and avoid potentially devastating wrecks. Unprecedented terrain deformation creates ever-changing courses as off-road vehicles carve lines and deep ruts that have a real-time impact on gameplay and remain persistent through the full length of each race.

	Some mini-games have been included as well, including ATV hockey, Monster Truck Smash and Tag to name a few. The online mode has the player compete against other competitors. The gameplay is very similar to the console systems, certain buttons for gas, brakes while the Wii remote can be used as well.
	.
	The DS and PSP versions are almost similar. While the DS has few vehicles and only has a championship mode unlike the many series in the major console versions, it contains ten exclusive tracks and three stadiums. The PSP version is almost similar, but has different series from the consoles: Race, One on One, Time Attack, Stunt Challenge, Stunt Race, Hang-Time, Combo Challenge, Flag Challenge. It also has the X-Cross tournament, but it is named the MX vs. ATV World Tour instead. Games can be played against friends using Wi-Fi.

	You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.
	.
	Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.
	.
	The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.
	.
	The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.

	N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.
	.
	Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.
	.
	The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.
	.
	There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.

	At its core Nervous Brickdown is a Arkanoid-clone and the first ten levels feature the familiar gameplay of using a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom and a ball to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. But each of the ten worlds (divided into 9 levels and one boss fight) feature a different type of gameplay.
	.
	In the second stage the player needs to draw the paddle on the screen himself to knock the ball against ink blots. Depending on the form of the drawn paddle, the ball will bounce off differently. And to spice things up even more, the paddle isn't restricted to just horizontal movement anymore but can instead be freely moved around at the bottom of the screen. Other stages require the player to move through a haunted house and kill ghosts by blowing into the microphone or contain a laser beam which increases it's speed.
	.
	By playing successfully through the levels, the player unlocks bonuses which range from extra lives to the ability to change the trajectory of the ball by blowing into the microphone.
	.
	The game also features a multiplayer mode for two players in which the ball changes into the player's paddle color so it will only bounce off the paddle with the corresponding color.

	In a fitting reflection of the relationship shared with Amaterasu, the powerful sun goddess who embodied a wolf in Ōkami, the child deity Chibiterasu manifests in the form of a white wolf cub in Ōkamiden. The game is set nine months after the events of the previous game, and the young sun god is summoned to battle a sinister force that has drained the landscape of colour, leaving it withered and faded where once it was luminous with life.
	Ōkamiden shares many gameplay elements with its predecessor, including the paintbrush used as a weapon against enemies and for puzzle solving. Chibiterasu can also team up with various companions during the game for additional abilities.

	Onpu Island is an island populated by musical spirits called Ontama. These strange, multicolored creatures can allow skilled performers, called 'Ontamaestros', to perform music by gathering Ontama. Beat and Rest, two young friends from a small village on the island, find an Ontama on the street. They discover that the Ontama are being captured, and so they set out to find out what's happening to them, and to become Ontamaestros themselves.
	.
	Ontamarama is an action rhythm game that makes full use of the DS' capabilities. Ontama appear on the screen, and can be tapped, tossed, and circled. Clearing an Ontama makes fills a note on the bar along the top of the screen, and when the note reaches the end of the bar, the correct button must be pressed to play the note. There are four different colored Ontama, and you also need to watch out for the white and black ones which can help or hinder you in other ways!
	.
	The game includes a story mode, a tutorial mode, a free play mode where you can play songs cleared in the story mode, and a challenge mode. There is also a shop where you can buy songs and items with points acquired during the game.

description:
	Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name, where a rowdy brood of forest animals turn the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.
	.
	The game is a side-scrolling-puzzle adventure. The plot of the game is to complete puzzles and avoid traps to advance from level to level.  Every level completed will raise your friendship with the different animals of the forest.  Once friends, these animals can be used as allies to attack and defeat the hunters encountered along the way.
	.
	Following the plot of the movie, once the player has become friends with a sufficient amount of animals, he can then take on the evil hunter leader Shaw.
	.
	The gameplay loop is to find clever ways to solve puzzles that prevent you from moving forward in a level.  To solve these puzzles, the player can switch between the two main characters : Boog, a 900 pound bear and Elliott, a crazy deer.  Both characters have their specific skills which need to be wisely used to progress through the levels.  To solve most of the puzzles, Boog and Elliott, each controlled individually and seperately, will have to work as a team.
	.
	To complicate the gameplay a bit, the player will encounter hunters on the way which he can defeat "using" the now friendly skunks, beavers, squirrels...  which all have their unique skills.
	.
	This game is a 2,5D side-scrolling game with an emphasis on spatial puzzles. The story mode contains 27 levels. In addition, there's also eight minigames.

	Orcs & Elves is a turn-based role-playing game based on improved DOOM RPG engine. The story follows an elf named Elli who, along with a talking magic wand Ellon, heads to the depths of a devastated dwarven citadel to find out what happened there, battling foes of many kinds, finding mysterious items and meeting various people.
	.
	The game uses a first person perspective and dungeons are grid-based, similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series; the player can only move between squares, forward, backward, strafe left or right, turn in 90 degree increments. Enemies and dungeon features are drawn with sprite graphics. There are some 3D objects in the dungeons as well, and the game employs some 3D camera movements in the cutscenes. The dungeons mostly consist of one level, though it is possible to move between different parts of the dungeons and revisit the previous dungeons as necessary.

description:
	A portable adventure game based on the animated movie of the same name and which chronicled the adventures of a group of animals in their struggle against a recently-built housing development.
	.
	Playing as either RJ, Hammy or Verne you'll have to complete several incursions into the human dwellings to steal food, supplies and sabotage further housing developments.
	.
	Gameplay-wise the game is a 3rd-person perspective stealth-adventure hybrid in which you must navigate through several houses looking to retrieve your current objective while avoiding the many traps set by the homeowners (as well as the homeowners themselves). To get by you can make use of several unique items that allow you to set up diversions, or create them yourself by blowing into the microphone. Each character has individual strengths and weaknesses and in many missions you'll have to alternate between each character to successfully complete the level.
	.
	As a unique feature the game displays the standard 3rd person perspective on the top screen while the lower screen features a top-down view which allows you to better scan the levels for traps and items, both rendered with fully polygonal graphics.
	.
	Features a single player campaign and a wireless multiplayer mode with a two-player mode in which two players compete to clear out a level of food.

	Meet Giblet, Blaze, Stench, and Zap - an elite Minion crew who, assisted by minion master Gnarl, get star billing in Overlord Minions, an irresistible and accessible puzzle action game, designed exclusively for Nintendo DS. In Overlord Minions, the Overlord commands the Minion team remotely. The Nintendo DS stylus becomes an extension of his evil will and every precise Touch Screen command is the player-as-Overlord directing, commanding and combining minions in battle, pointing and sweeping them to attack enemies and solving puzzles to execute his dastardly plans. Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style.

Players can roll and dash around the environment as well as execute maneuvers such as hairpin turns, immediate stops and precision rolling with effortless strokes of the stylus. In his quest to save Pac-Land, Pac-Man will venture through stages such as Castle Pac, Gyro-Jungle and the Ghost House, while facing perilous hazards like moving floors, dash panels, jump zones and wind zones. Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the "Knight Chocolate," providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage. Pac'N Roll also includes the original Pac-Man arcade game, allowing up to two players to munch on pellets and claim the highest score.

	Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.
	.
	You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.
	.
	During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.

	Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!
	.
	Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:
	.
	1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
	2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
	3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
	4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
	5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
	6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.
	.
	Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?
	.
	You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).

While running an errand for Elm, the player returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pokémon. This event starts your quest to becoming a Pokémon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and capture all 493 Pokémon.
	Along with retaining most of the original game's features, HeartGold contains quite a few new updates. Like Gold the story will incorporate the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS iterations, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The ability to have any one of your Pokémon following you on the Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in Pokémon Yellow has been added.
	Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pokéwalker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pokéwalker allows you to wirelessly transfer a Pokémon from HeartGold to it. When there is a Pokémon in the Pokéwalker it gains "experience points" for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as "watts", which is used to help catch other Pokémon and buy items.
	The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pokémon SoulSilver, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.

Pokémon Platinum includes for the first time in the 4th generation, the Battle Frontier which can be played on and off-line, make Poffins on-line. Players can collect badges, challenge the Elite Four, and become the ultimate Pokémon master.
	The game continues the basic idea of previous Pokémon games - the player, a new trainer, sets out on a quest to catch every known Pokémon and defeat the Pokémon league. Along the way, the player will attempt to foil the plots of the evil organization, Team Galactic, who seek to use a trio of legendary Pokémon to awaken a sleeping titan with the power to control space. There are many sidequests and other activities along the way, the Battle Frontier, expanded on-line options, downloadable content via Mystery Gift, a brand new GTS with the option to receive notifications of completed traded over the Wii, record battle videos, the option to submit one's Pokémon party data for others to see and the Distortion World, which defies the laws of gravity and contains Platinum's mascot, Giratina.
	The core Pokémon series features an RPG turn-based battle system. Each monster can learn up to four attacks. In a single turn, the two opponents select their attacks, and the one with the higher Speed attacks first. The amount of damage is influenced by the Attack and Defense stats. In the past, attacks were automatically classified as Physical or Special based on their elemental type. In Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum each attack can be individually categorized, so attacks which use natural elements are Special, and those which use simple force are Physical.
	The Pokémon Contests from Ruby and Sapphire return, with many new features. In addition to the attack performance, where the player must try to impress the judge with flashy moves, players will also dress up their Pokémon and dance in time to music. Diamond and Pearl also bring back the real time system from Gold and Silver, where day and night are reflected in your game. Some Pokémon are only catchable during certain times.

	In the region of Oblivia, a gang of thieves known as the "Pokémon Pinchers" are stealing wild Pokémon and planning to use them for their own nefarious purposes.  Two Pokémon Rangers, Summer and Ben, are sent to investigate.  However, after an encounter with the Pinchers, one of them is kidnapped while the other is left stranded on an island.  There they meet a Pichu with a ukulele, who teams up with them to help rescue its Pichu friends who have also been captured by then Pinchers.  Can you rescue your partner, and save the Pokémon of the Oblivia region?
	Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs is the third in the Pokémon Ranger series.  As with the previous games, you move your character around using a device known as the stylus, as well as battling with a device called the "capture styler" (represented by the stylus).  To battle, you encounter a Pokémon on the touch screen, and your aim is to repeatedly draw connecting loops around it until you deplete its health to zero, allowing it to join your team.  Pokémon can be used in the environment to clear obstacles and help you progress (such as such as cutting trees, extinguishing fires and so on), or by assisting you in battle and helping you weaken enemy Pokémon.  Near the start of the game, Ukulele Pichu becomes a part of your team and randomly appears during battles to assist.  If you tap it when it appears, it will jump into battle and play its ukulele, which scatters musical notes around the screen which weaken enemies.
	A little bit further into the game, you also gain the help of the Legendary Pokémon dogs, Raikou, Entei and Suicune, first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver.  These Pokémon have special abilities that allow you to reach places that you normally couldn't (for example, Raikou can leap across large gaps).  To summon these Pokémon, you must draw a special sign with the stylus that represents them, but these can only be drawn outside where the sky can be seen.
	After a key point in the game, you also unlock the ability to travel back in time with Celebi, which gives you access to wireless multiplayer Pokémon Ranger missions.  These missions can be played with up to four players, and Rangers can team up to help capture Pokémon more quickly.  This is a great help as each mission must be completed within a certain time for it to be a success.  Most wireless missions can also be played solo, but are more difficult this way.  You can also earn experience which can be used to increase your capture styler's power, health and speed.

release: 2008-04-17

description:
	Polar Bowler is a bowling game. But no ordinary, the game uses an Arctic theme (more or less). Furthermore, there is not even a ball in the game.
	.
	First off, the game offers two different game modes, “Straight Bowling” and “Power Bowling”. Furthermore there are 7 different lanes and 6 different characters in the game, so you can play an Ice bear, a Penguin, a Snowman, or even Santa Claus. But the game starts only with one lane and one character.
	.
	Straight Bowling acts much like the classic bowling. You have the ten pins and your character, which is the game’s substitute for your ball, and you must smash as many pins as possible in order to get a good score (and to win the game when you are not playing alone). You start your ride by positioning your character at the beginning where you want him to slide from. In contrary to a real bowling, you can’t throw the “ball” diagonal, but that’s not needed too. Once your ride has started, you can move your character left and right and change his destination. You can even slide a curve, if you’re good. If not, the physic do their job. You can even control how fast you slide, but that only at the beginning of the ride. Their, you can choose the speed by tighten the line you use to throw you into the lane.
	.
	Power Bowling sets on top of this. Here the game gets spiced up by Power Ups. After you positioned your character and tightened your line, at that time you can’t change your position anymore, Power Ups appear on the lane. Once you collect them, they work in this throw, and this throw only, once you return to the start, their bonuses will be reset. So you must collect them, and use them immediately (will be automatically used, when the character impacts on the pins). There are two different types of Power Ups, one that affect your character, and one that affects your score.
	.
	The following Power Ups are possible to find: Bomb (doubles the power of the character; at the impact it will smash more pins then regular), Zap (will send an electrical discharge out on impact with the pins, which will smash much more then the bomb), Vapor (will vaporize all pins on impact; will result in a strike even when you only touch one of the pins at the far sides), Multiplier (will multiply the amount of pins you smash with the type you collected for your total score), Multiplier can be found as 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x. Smashing 5 pins with a multiplier of 3x will result in 5 regular points and 10 power points.
	.
	The basic scoring is on both game modes the same, it is also the same like regular bowling rules. In Power Bowling mode, once you finished the game, the amount of power points you gathered, will be added to the regular points, and so both of them will determine your final score. So, with many strikes you can get awesome scores.
	.
	Every time you reach 200 points on a single lane, you unlock a new lane or a new character.
	.
	And like a real bowling game, the game can be a multiplayer game, were up to four player can participate, playing on the same computer in Hotseat mode.

	This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.
	.
	There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical.  Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen.  The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same.  But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus.  There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.
	.
	The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer.  Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks.  As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary.  The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does.  The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play.  In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer.  The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.

The object is to form at least a single triangle formation by linking viruses together and erasing them from the screen. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but erasing all of the viruses will be the fundamental rule of this game. Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once.

Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!
	.
	A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.
	.
	When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.
	.
	Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.

But in addition to the standard "Puyo Puyo", "TSU" and "Fever" rules, there are also new gimmick modes and modes returning from past Puyo Puyo games. The most noticeable rule change in the game, however, may be the "Pair Puyo" mode, a co-op mode where two teams of two players battle it out to end all their opponents' lives.

	Throughout the world, the people of the major powers throughout the land live in peace and prosperity, unaware that a great evil lurks on the horizon. There is a clandestine group, under the guise of scholarly research, plotting to resurrect a goddess whose time has long since passed. To achieve this goal, they need two things; a vessel of flesh and blood to house the spirit of the goddess, and the lives of every living being offered up as a sacrifice. It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers named Shiera, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also of the world around her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will ultimately decide the fate of the entire world. Ragnarok Online, the international massively multiplayer online (MMO) phenomenon, now comes to the Nintendo DS. With over three million registered users in North America, Ragnarok DS brings the same addictive game play of exploration and customization to a handheld platform, giving the huge number of online PC players the next best thing when they are unable to log into their regular Ragnarok Online account from a computer.

	Bubby and Bobby return in this Nintendo DS update to the popular arcade game, Rainbow Islands.  The game takes place several years after Bubble Bobble, and the brothers now have the ability to create rainbows to destroy their enemies.  However, they'll need this ability, as the residents of the seven Rainbow Islands have been imprisoned, and need to be rescued!
	.
	The DS version of Rainbow Islands functions differently from the original.  Your character is now floating inside a bubble on the touch screen, and the levels can be seen both on the top and touch screens.  You can drag your character around the screen by touching them with the stylus, or you can drag the stylus elsewhere on-screen to create a rainbow.  If you tap a drawn rainbow, it will fall down vertically, killing any enemies underneath.
	.
	Finally, there are two special rainbows that can be drawn if you hold the L or R buttons, each with their own special function.  Drawing a circle will create a large bubble which you can drag around the screen and hit other enemies with; while drawing a triangle will create a kind of black hole that will suck in enemies, allowing you to take them out in one go.  Lastly, there is a special rainbow that can only be drawn when your 'Star Gauge' is full: when it is, this gauge can be tapped, and the player is given a short time to draw a five-pointed star (similar to the 'Healing Touch' in Trauma Center).  If successful, all enemies on both screens will be destroyed.
	.
	In addition to this new style of play, there is also a 'Score Mode'.  In this mode, you only have one life, and must earn as many points as possible as a barrage of enemies continues to attack you.  The game also has two secret characters to unlock, as well as a Versus Mode where players compete to reach the top of the level first.  The special rainbows are not available in either of these modes.

	Red Bull BC One is a Nintendo DS game based on a break dancing competition with the same name. It's a mix of a rhythm action game and a puzzle game where players get to compete against different break dancers from around the world.
	.
	Before starting the game players gets to design their own dancer. This is done in the dressing room where the players can customize their characters in different categories. It's possible to choose different body styles, hairstyles and clothing. Playing the career mode will let players unlock more clothing that their character can use.
	.
	The actual gameplay consists of performing different dance moves. These moves are shown on the top screen and are done by playing a simple connect the dots puzzle game on the lower screen. Dots of different colour are shown across the screen and the player has to create shapes by connecting at least three dots of the same colour using the stylus. For each turn the player need to create as many shapes as possible before the time runs out. There is also special star shaped dots. If these are included in a shape the player will perform special moves and gain more points. It's also possible to create perfects, which is the largest possible shape of the turn. By creating multiple perfects the player will gain multipliers that will multiply the overall score.
	.
	There's a couple of game modes. The main one is the career mode where players get to battle against different b-boys with the goal to reach the final of the Red Bull BC One competition. There's also the free mode where players can improve their scores of a specific battle. The game also has a multiplayer mode where players can compete against friends in a one-on-one battle via multi card play.

	The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.
	.
	Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other.  In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems.  The other 5 players don't even need the game.  There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though.  So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.

	Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
	Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.
	.
	Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.
	.
	In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.
	.
	The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.

	The battles in Rondo of Swords use the unusual Route Maneuver System. Instead of walking up to an enemy and attacking, instead you will run through enemies to attack. This adds tactical considerations; you can easily attack multiple enemies in a turn, you can run through allies to get bonuses to your attack, and you can attack from the sides or behind to get an advantage.

	Scribblenauts is a side-scrolling action game based on puzzles. The goal is to have the character Maxwell overcome obstacles by summoning objects based on a dictionary of more than 20.000 words, partly based on the concept of the real-life game Mad Libs. This is done by writing an object's name on the touchscreen, letter by letter. When the word is recognized, the object spawns in the world, where it can be manipulated or act on its own. This leads to an endless amount of possibilities to progress through the game. For instance, when an item needs to be retrieved from a tree, you could summon a ladder to get it out, a football to hit it, or just a helicopter or an albatross to fly over there. There are also more bizarre examples, such as summoning a time machine, going back in time to fetch a dinosaur egg, make it hatch and then use it in the future to defeat an army of robot zombies. The list also includes weapons, historical people, and even references to popular cultures and internet memes. Profanity and trademarked objects are not recognized. There is also a spelling checker included to offer suggestions.
	.
	This game is a logical sequel to the gameplay mechanics of Drawn to Life, an earlier title by 5TH Cell, relying on the same concept of emergent gameplay, where the actual game is more of a toolbox, shaped through the player's interaction and different in each session. During the game Maxwell needs to collect starites. To do this, two to four objects are often summoned at the same time. There are general, slow puzzle levels, but also faster action levels filled with enemies, platforms, switches and traps. Often, the summoned objects and characters need to interact with each other. Players can earn "merits" for not using weapons in a level for instance and finding a more creative approach. When a level is completed, a silver star is awarded and the Free Play mode for the level is unlocked. When the level is then completed three more times, using a different approach each time, a gold star is provided.
	.
	By solving puzzles, Ollars are awarded, the game's currency. It can be exchanged for different avatars or visual changes. The game includes a level editor and support for Wi-Fi to share the levels. The existing levels can also be edited and the way certain summoned objects interact with each other can also be modified.

	The Settlers is a remake of The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici for the Nintendo DS.
	.
	The premise of the game is set to ancient Rome, with you taking control of the Romans in the main campaign, or additionally the Vikings, Nubian and Asian empires in Free Play mode.
	.
	The game works very differently from most general strategy games. Your goal is to reach the gateway at the end of each map, usually hidden amidst the enemy lines. You must build military buildings to expand your borders that you can reach the resources that are initially out of your reach. Eventually reaching the gateway to proceed onto the next level. Your city needs roads to optimize the trade routes and allow different buildings to get the resources they need for production.
	.
	The game is highly based on gathering resources and optimizing the roads to provide maximal resource gathering. In example, you need a woodcutter to provide a sawmill with logs in order for the builders to build new structures and harbors to build ships for your expeditions.
	.
	The game is almost a 1:1 recreation of the original Settlers II game, but it adds few new things to the game such as new music and new GUI to support the stylus.

description:
	Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.
	.
	The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:
	.
	1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.
	.
	2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.
	.
	3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.
	.
	4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.
	.
	5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.
	.
	Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two players through a wireless connection (DS).

	As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.
	.
	Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.
	.
	New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office.  Players can send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each other, they earn special monuments for their cities.  Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.

	When Bart finds a mysterious game manual, he realizes that he and his family have become the main characters of the newest hit video game -- The Simpsons Game!
	Each of the Simpsons are playable in this sidescroller action game and feature their own wacky, special abilities. Homer can transform into a large blob and roll his way through levels. Bart can don a cowl and cape and become Bartman, using his slingshot and gliding ability to overcome the game's goons. Lisa can use an all-touchscreen Hand of Buddha to solve puzzles and remove obstacles from her path, and Marge can control mobs to overwhelm anyone who stands in her way.
	Each of the game's twelve episodes parodies some bit of precious popular culture, including spoofs of such classic videogames as Frogger, Space Invaders, Pokémon, and Madden. The game is chock full of video and voice overs featuring the original cast and written by the show writers. The voices, story, and cutscenes means the game's irreverent humor include plenty of references for Simpsons fanatics who will catch all the inside jokes from old episodes.
	Exclusive to the DS game is "Pet Homer," a sort of virtual pet game where the player collects various items to feed to Homer (and watch the crazy outcome), as well as several multiplayer minigames.

In this puzzle game players need to line up groups of three or more adjacent Snoods to remove them, similar to the Bust-a-move series. They are launched from the Snood-o-matic cannon at the bottom of the screen. For every Snood launched, the danger level increases and causes the Snoods at the top to move downwards. When the bottom is reached, the game is lost.

You'll see many dogs and cats along the way, but don't expect your furry friends to be on all fours – they're anthropomorphs. With his cigarette-like bone sticking out of his mouth, Red Savarin, an overconfident teenager, and his specialized robot Dahak have made a name for themselves by taking on odd jobs. Red's curiosity gets the best of him when he comes across a mysterious medallion. Ruh-oh, strange artifacts? This can't be going anywhere good. But before Red runs off with the medallion, he comes across Elh, a sullen, enigmatic creature who shares an unknown link with the medallion for Red to uncover.

	The story of Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood is split into ten chapters. The first six take place in Sonic's world, with the team attempting to find Knuckles, and trying to stop the Master Emerald from being taken by the Marauders. The final four sees Sonic and the team traveling to another dimension, called the Twilight Cage, in order to stop a new threat to their own world and confront the alien species that reside there.

	Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins. Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other characters include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus. Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.

With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.
	.
	Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush.  Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible.  By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.
	.
	When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices.  At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them.  Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels.  However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.
	.
	Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.

	Soul Bubbles is very similar to Bubble Ghost and requires the player to save lost Spirits by transporting them in bubbles to the exit of each level.
	.
	The player takes over the role of a Spirit Herder who is tasked with ferrying souls to the underworld. To move the Spirits and keep them relatively save, they need to be be enclosed in soup bubbles. The Spirit Herder then can blow those bubbles through the level, deflate them if they are too big and even cut them into two bubbles and rejoin them later when required. If a bubble bursts, the Spirit will slowly suffocate and eventually die if the player can't draw a new bubble around it fast enough.
	.
	But the way to the Gateway Cube isn't an easy one and it's not just as simple as blowing the bubbles from start to finish in the 40 levels. Besides the natural dangers in form of rocks, plants or hungry critters that all destroy the bubble, there are also environment puzzles waiting to be solved like activating a switch which requires a big bubble. There is also Star Dust and so-called Calabash waiting to be collected. While the Star Dust will increase the light emitted by the Spirits and can be collected by simply drawing a new bubble around it, the Calabashs are well hidden but once the player found them all, he will unlock the eighth World called Agartha, the Land of the Dead.
	.
	To help with the search, the Spirits will change their shape to heart if a Calabash is near or turn into yellow triangles if there is imminent danger.

	Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.
	.
	Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.

	Junior Nanairo Interplanetary Patrol officers Rallen and Jeena are on a routine mission when they hear a strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy.
	.
	Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it.
	.
	The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages.
	.
	The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy.

	While exploring the thought-to-be-long-abandoned palace of the Ancient Demon King, the young thief Anise stumbles upon a startling discovery: the palace isn't abandoned at all, and it's crawling with demons, no less! Equally startling is the deadly booby trap she triggers in the process of opening a locked door. She barely outruns the giant boulder bearing down on her, escaping the palace only to fall into a surging river, unconscious. The fairy Kukri, imprisoned for centuries in the chamber Anise inadvertently unlocked, rescues her and takes her to the Castle of Albyon. Anise awakens in the presence of the King, whose son is being held by demons in the very palace Anise narrowly escaped from. Recent events have unshakably convinced the King that this thief is descended from the Legendary Hero of Albyon, he who slew the Ancient Demon King centuries ago, and so he commands her thusly: free the Prince from the vile demons... or be tried and convicted as a thief and locked away for life.

description:
	Based on the movie of the same name, Superman Returns puts you behind the cape of the man of steel as he returns to the earth after his exile in outer space.
	.
	Your main objective is to protect Metropolis from the attacks of several enemies ripped right from Superman's comics.
	The main campaign gives you a hexagonal map of Metropolis which pinpoints your location as well as your current enemy's location and any disaster areas he may have caused. Since Superman himself is invulnerable, Metropolis itself has a health bar that keeps track of just how much damage the city is enduring, and which measures your level of success/failure.Your objective thus is to move around the map each turn to try and take control of each disaster area which triggers a timed 3rd person perspective sequence in which you control Superman as he flies through the city and uses his powers to solve whatever task is at hand (blowing out fires with his super-breath, destroying mind-control beacons with his heat vision, saving people, etc. etc.) catching up with your enemies triggers a fight sequence in which you must input the correct button-presses on cue to defeat your opponents. In between these rounds story segments that follow the movie's plot play out, which involve a unique 3D action sequence that mimics the movie's counterpart.
	.
	Features a single-player campaign as well as two wireless multiplayer modes in which you can face-off against four other Supermen in unique disaster areas to see who gets to clear the objectives faster than the rest. Also includes a gallery of Superman comic covers that are unlocked by collecting Krypton crystals in the game.

	Surf's Up is based on the 2007 animated film of the same name, featuring surfing penguins and wacky hijinks.
	.
	Surf's up for DS and PSP is a racing game that brings the player through an interesting adventure featuring all the characters from the CGI movie.
	.
	The player can choose from a bunch of the movie characters and compete in races against other movie characters.  Each character has their own specific skills and their own surf boards.  The different levels/races contain jumps/ramps which enables the player to perform tricks using either the stylus to draw objects (DS) or repeating a button sequence (PSP).  Performing tricks will give you a speed boost which might just help you finish the race first and move on to the next round.
	.
	The levels also contain shortcuts and the race track is populated with different objects that can be used to gain a speed boost, distract or hit opponents and ultimately will help you finish the race first.
	.
	The game also offers a multi-player mode which enables you to play with friends who have the game and even friends who don't have the game (but have a console).

	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack is a modern take on the original Turtles arcade game. Unlike Konami's Turtle beat 'em ups, Arcade Attack is in fact 3D while attempting to play as though it were 2D but with a slightly isometric camera angle. The game can be played alone with a CPU ally or with a friend wirelessly with a selection of the four turtles, each with their own varying stats. Also much like Smash Up, while the game tries to blend both the new and the old TMNT universe all into one it leans a lot more heavily toward the new with its visual style and enemy selection.

	At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.
	.
	Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.
	.
	Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.
	.
	Push mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.
	.
	Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.
	.
	Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.
	.
	Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.
	.
	Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.
	.
	Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.

	Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.
	.
	Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
	.
	You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.
	.
	It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T., but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.

	The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

	Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).
	.
	Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate, brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible. The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.
	.
	The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.

	Transformers: Autobots is the first game of the double movie tie-in for the 2008 movie. In the Autobots version players take command of the good guys. The game start outs in the big city where the players learns how to control the custom Transformer. Tapping the touchscreen has the transformer change from a quick-moving vehicle into a huge robot. The robot form can climb buildings, smash cars or other world objects, fight Decepticons, and learn the basics of the mission on earth.
	From there the player completes missions in the city and travels to other locations. By scanning the large number of vehicles in the environment it becomes possible to transform into them. Some are just for fun, like the ice cream truck, but there are also helicopters and planes.
	Players can compete against your friends, including those who bought Transformers: Decepticons, in several game modes in local 4-player multiplayer. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi players complete daily missions to earn points for the Autobots side in the battle for the Allspark. Player profiles can be uploaded and looked up on the game's official website where other profiles or scores can be checked out or compared.
	Aside from the gameplay mechanics and visual style, the Aubots version is quite different from the Decepticons version, with its own characters, missions, focus on situations in the movie and a different conclusion. Unlike the console versions the Transformers are initially restricted in their abilities and need to level up to a role-playing-like upgrade system. The game's focus is largely on attacking as there are little to no means of defence (including blocking), instead there are plenty of health icons.

	Transformers: Decepticons is the second game of the double movie tie-in for the 2008 movie. In the Decepticons version players take command of the bad guys. The game start outs in the big city where the players learns how to control the custom Transformer. Tapping the touchscreen has the transformer change from a quick-moving vehicle into a huge robot. The robot form can climb buildings, smash cars or other world objects, fight Autobots, and learn the basics of the mission on earth.
	From there the player completes missions in the city and travels to other locations. By scanning the large number of vehicles in the environment it becomes possible to transform into them. Some are just for fun, like the ice cream truck, but there are also helicopters and planes.
	Players can compete against your friends, including those who bought Autobots, in several game modes in local 4-player multiplayer. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi players complete daily missions to earn points for the Decepticons side in the battle for the Allspark. Player profiles can be uploaded and looked up on the game's official website where other profiles or scores can be checked out or compared.
	Aside from the gameplay mechanics and visual style, the Decepticons version is quite different from the Autobots version, with its own characters, missions, focus on situations in the movie and a different conclusion. Unlike the console versions the Transformers are initially restricted in their abilities and need to level up to a role-playing-like upgrade system. The game's focus is largely on attacking as there are little to no means of defence (including blocking), instead there are plenty of health icons.

	For Ultimate Spider-Man for the DS, developer Vicarious Visions takes the technology and gameplay style  of their earlier Spider-Man 2 to adapt the storyline of the console version for the handheld.
	Based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series, the game follows up on the comic's storyline about Peter Parker's childhood friend Eddie Brock and the Venom suit. Three months after his apparent death, Venom roams the streets of New York again. Thus Spider-Man must not only deal with the usual assortment of criminals and supervillains but also his old friend, while both Trask Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. have set their sights on Eddie, who struggles to take control of the Venom suit. The DS game follows a cut-down version of the console version's storyline, but differs a lot in the details. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes that emulate the drawings of series artist Mark Bagley and also feature voice acting.
	The game is a 2D side-scroller with real 3D graphics, with the camera moving and rotating to always keep the protagonist in view. Players will play as both Spider-Man and Venom, who have different abilities and are controlled in fundamentally different ways. Both must beat up various enemies and fight bosses, but other goals vary between the two.
	Spider-Man is controlled via a standard button interface, allowing him to jump, swing along his web, punch, kick, shoot web balls and use his web to zip to walls and ceilings. When attack moves are stringed into combos, a power meter fills up that allows Spidey to unleash a special move that can be selected beforehand from the touch screen. His Spider-Sense also comes into play: when in immediate danger, an icon flashes. Pressing the left shoulder button within time allows Spider-Man to dodge the attack that follows.
	A large part of Spider-Man's levels consists of rescuing innocents - freeing them from below heavy objects or carrying them away from danger. Lifting up the objects requires stroking upwards on the touch screen. The screen is also used for modifying electronics or disarming bombs. Lights flash up on a grid: green ones must be touched and red ones avoided.
	In contrast, Venom is controlled almost exclusively through the touch screen. Alternate button-based controls are available but don't offer the full variety of moves. Venom can attack through either his claws or his tendrils by tapping either close or away from him. He can also use his tendrils to pick up objects and enemies and throw them around or smash them to the ground, all done through stylus movements. A further use of the tendrils is a targeted attack launched by stroking away from Venom in the wanted direction.
	Another gameplay element that only applies to Venom is feeding. The Venom suit drains Eddie's health constantly, so he must feed on humans to survive. This is done by simply tapping and holding the intended victim.
	The game features branching paths: at some points, players can choose where to continue with the story (like Spider-Man choosing on whether to confront Shocker or the Rhino), leading to different sets of levels.
	A multiplayer mode is also available: it features five different characters and eight arenas for one-on-one fights.

Fire lasers and blue pellets at a steady wave of fruit and vegetable creatures, causing the personified food to explode in a bright burst. The depiction is mostly whimsical, though you do see their "kill percentage" tallied on menu screens at the end of each round. Game customized for each target platform.

	Slow - Joe's signature VFX move, this allows him to slow down time to effectively dodge and counter enemy attacks.
	Scratch - Shake things up and drop items on enemies, or just shake them until they're dizzy.
	Split - Alter your environment by cutting a new path yourself.
	Slide - Get a closeup view of the action and add a little extra power to Joe's hits.

description:
	This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.
	.
	The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.
	.
	The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.
	.
	The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.

	.
	Neku and his partner Shiki Misaki find themselves as "Players" in a game that lasts seven days.  Each day, players are given various missions to perform by the "Reapers" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.
	.
	Players use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against "The Noise", animal-like creatures which can corrupt the people and environment around them.  Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone.  Neku fights on the lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen.  Their combat styles are different, but can be combined to form more powerful attacks.
	.
	Players can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their pin abilities.  PP is usally gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with another person's DS.
	.
	There is also a wi-fi mini-game called "Ten Pin Slammer", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.

	.
	Adding to the replayability, each of the four monks has his or her own unique moves and special elemental attacks, which you can unlock as you play through the game. You can also use the weird and wonderful powers of the Shen Gong Wu that you collect to aid you in your quest, including the Two Ton Tunic, the Third Arm Sash and the Star Hanabi.

Like in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi is carrying Baby Mario on his back and is walking through the countryside. There are enemies, pits in the ground, and other obstacles you must circumnavigate. You do not control Yoshi; you must use the stylus to draw alternate paths (made of small clouds), kill enemies, and throw eggs for him. There is only one level, but it can be played as a Marathon game, Time Attack, Score Attack, and a couple other modes. You can also play against a friend in Versus mode.

	After failing to kidnap the Mario Bros. in the original Yoshi's Island, Kamek the Magikoopa has decided to set his sights higher.  Instead of just kidnapping the famous brothers, he's sent an army of his toadies out to kidnap children across the world!  Luckily, Mario avoids escape, and again lands in the hands of the Yoshis.  It's up to the Yoshis to carry Mario across Yoshi's Island and rescue Luigi and the other babies.
	.
	Yoshi's Island DS is a sequel to the SNES game, Yoshi's Island.  In it, players control Yoshi as he travels to Kamek's castle to rescue Luigi.  Yoshi can carry Baby Mario, Peach, DK, Wario or Bowser on his back - depending on the baby carried, Yoshi will gain a special ability; for example, Mario lets Yoshi dash, Peach allows Yoshi to float for a longer period of time, and Wario whips out a gigantic magnet to attract coins and other metallic objects.  If Yoshi is hit by an enemy, a counter appears, and begins to slowly count down to zero.  If it reaches zero, the baby is kidnapped, and Yoshi loses a life.  Yoshi can increase his counter by collecting stars that are rewards for some puzzles and defeating certain enemies.
	.
	Another feature of Yoshi's Island DS is the ability to hurl eggs to defeat foes.  Yoshi can eat nearly every enemy - if you press down on the control pad when Yoshi is holding an enemy in his mouth, he will turn it into an egg.  Yoshi can hurl his eggs at enemies and objects such as certain walls to destroy them.  You can even pick up coins and other collectibles by throwing an egg at them.  Finally, Yoshi can ricochet eggs off walls to hit things that he would otherwise be unable to reach.
	.
	While the object of each level is to simply reach the end, avid gamers will aim to get 100% for each level.  To do this, they must reach the end of each level with thirty stars, find the twenty red coins hidden amongst the regular ones, and collect the five flowers in each level.  One special  "Character Coin" is also hidden in each level - these have a picture of a particular baby on them, and can only be collected when Yoshi has that baby on his back.

	Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.
	.
	The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode.
	.
	At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.
	.
