    <desc>Barbarian II features only a single-player mode, in which the player assumes the role of either sword-wielding Princess Mariana or the titular savage, who is armed with a battleaxe. Their common quest is to pursue the evil wizard Drax, who has fled to his dungeon hideout after his defeat in the first game. The player characters battle their way through an inhospitable wasteland, a system of caves, and a dungeon before facing Drax in his inner sanctum for a showdown.</desc>

    <name>Batman the Movie (Europe)</name>
    <desc>The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The levels have varying gameplay:    The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher platforms and swing across gaps.  In the second level, Batman rides in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to swing around corners to avoid running into the police.  The third level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the market.  The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous gas without hitting the balloons themselves.  Finally, the fifth level, which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.</desc>

    <desc>Burnin' Rubber is the game that was included with every Plus and GX4000 on a cartridge, in a bid to showcase the Plus machine's new hardware abilities. Therefore it was quite popular, although it did not really show off the Plus capabilities, being an early title and all. Despite that, it wasn't a bad game on its own and is considered one of the good racing games on the Amstrad.</desc>

    <name>Fire and Forget 2 (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Fire &amp; Forget II is a 1990 futuristic racing-shooting video game developed by Titus Arcade and published by Sega for the Master System, and by Amstrad for the GX4000. It is the sequel to Fire and Forget, which was developed by Titus France SA for a number of platforms including the ZX Spectrum. Fire &amp; Forget II is one of a number of similar games which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of Sega's popular arcade driving game Out Run (1986). It is notable for the variety of its enemy sprites, and for its use of parallax scrolling. It is also notable for being one of the first video games to be launched simultaneously on two consoles.</desc>

    <name>World of Sports (Europe)</name>
    <desc>World of Sports, is, as its name suggests, a sports game. These events were already present on computer versions of World Games, but if the game was renamed World of Sports on GX 4000 is simply that, we find here only 4 of the many events present on the original version. So let's go over the 4 parts of the game. First of all the bike cross event, entitled BMX. The cap well pressed on the skull, gloved hands gripping the handlebars, you're ready to go. You have a minute to complete the course of moguls, descents, haystacks. Points will be awarded if you browse all this in style (but if metal tubes and wheels that can have style). There is mess in the air. In the slalom race, we stay on a track, but it is white and cold because it is snow. Your skier goes with the joystick, skid, acceleration, all responding perfectly to the player's orders. You have 45 seconds to hit the track, and points will score two points per pass. Fun and difficult to make a faultless course in record time. The third test is surfing titled Surfing very cleverly. With tanned skin, blond hair in the wind, and the board underfoot, you will have to ride a huge wave and do tricks in the air to score a maximum of points. As in other events, everything happens in a limited time. The character is animated, and the wave is composed of a gradient of pretty blue. Accapulco its beaches, its sun, its rocks, and at the top of the rocks, its crackers who plunge dizzying heights shouting "Yaaaaawaaaayaaaaa" and crashing in a few meters of water that goes and comes. You may not know it, but you are part of this race of the unconscious. Admit to the best dive possible by avoiding to smash you on the rock face, or to smash your skull at the bottom of the water. After each jump, a bird passes by with a beak, a banner indicating the note that you obtained for your modest performance. If you blow your mouth, a pelican covers his eyes with his wings. Funny. The animation and the neat graphics, make this event too, a success.</desc>
