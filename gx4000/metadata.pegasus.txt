	Barbarian II features only a single-player mode, in which the player assumes the role of either sword-wielding Princess Mariana or the titular savage, who is armed with a battleaxe. Their common quest is to pursue the evil wizard Drax, who has fled to his dungeon hideout after his defeat in the first game. The player characters battle their way through an inhospitable wasteland, a system of caves, and a dungeon before facing Drax in his inner sanctum for a showdown.

description:
	The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The levels have varying gameplay:    The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher platforms and swing across gaps.  In the second level, Batman rides in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to swing around corners to avoid running into the police.  The third level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the market.  The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous gas without hitting the balloons themselves.  Finally, the fifth level, which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.

description:
	Burnin' Rubber is the game that was included with every Plus and GX4000 on a cartridge, in a bid to showcase the Plus machine's new hardware abilities. Therefore it was quite popular, although it did not really show off the Plus capabilities, being an early title and all. Despite that, it wasn't a bad game on its own and is considered one of the good racing games on the Amstrad.

The game is played Operation Wolf style, though the screen won't move - you have to kill a pre-determined number of goons before you can progress any further down the street. There are also nice little bonus levels in between locations, involving loads of bottles of booze and some blokeys trying frantically to pack it. Your job here is to shoot the whiskey before it gets packed.

	Fire & Forget II is a 1990 futuristic racing-shooting video game developed by Titus Arcade and published by Sega for the Master System, and by Amstrad for the GX4000. It is the sequel to Fire and Forget, which was developed by Titus France SA for a number of platforms including the ZX Spectrum. Fire & Forget II is one of a number of similar games which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of Sega's popular arcade driving game Out Run (1986). It is notable for the variety of its enemy sprites, and for its use of parallax scrolling. It is also notable for being one of the first video games to be launched simultaneously on two consoles.
