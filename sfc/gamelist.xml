    <name>Acrobat Mission  </name>
    <desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.nnnnYour spaceship is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.</desc>

    <desc>The game continues the story of the young princess Ariel. After she rightfully regained her throne, people enjoyed a peaceful life under her benevolent reign. But this peaceful existence did not last long... Two adventurers who were wandering through mountains met a mysterious evil being, who threatened to ruin Ariel's kingdom. After that, the two men disappeared without a trace. Ariel's servants reported to her about the matter. After consulting her wise grandmother, Ariel decided to go out herself, to meet up with her old trusty companions and to find out the origin of the new threat.

The game is a console-style RPG - you fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Enemies may attack you from the sides, and you should pay attention which enemy you face. A unique feature the game uses is the ability to get special items called "souls" after battles, and then to use them to forge your own armor. </desc>

To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</desc>

    <path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
    <name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story  </name>
    <desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in  Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of  Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks. </desc>

    <desc>The game is based on the animé series Sailor Moon. The main character of the series is Tsukino Usagi, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who unexpectedly gets involved in an epic adventure. Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies. </desc>

    <desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic ("Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Super S: Floating Panic") is a puzzle game licensed by Bandai that features the various Sailor Guardians, including the new "super" transformations of Usagi Tsukino (Sailor Moon) and Chibi-usa (Sailor Chibi Moon) that debuted in the "Super S" season, which was the name of the fourth season of the anime adaptation.nnnnThe goal of the game is to fire at the balloons that appear at the top of the screen to pop them. By shooting a balloon adjacent to another of the same color, the player pops both simultaneously. By popping a large number of balloons simultaneously, they can create trash for the other player to clear - these appear as gray balloons that can't easily be popped directly but disappear when multiple balloons are popped near them.nnnnThe player can select between nine Sailor Guardians in the vs. mode (all except Saturn), but is restricted to Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus for the single-player story mode. Sailor Saturn appears in-game as an advisor, but is not playable. The game was followed by a sequel the following year: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2. It also received a fan translation in 2016.</desc>

    <desc>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object. </desc>

    <desc>In this action-strategy-RPG hybrid you play the role of a young member of a cave-dwelling race of warriors. As the planet is dying, it is your task to build the necessary mystic rooms in your caves to channel the energy back to the planet, but the surface-dwellers think that you are to blame for the current situation and constantly send waves of explorers and adventurers trying to clear your "dungeon".

The game is played from a top-down perspective using a 2D engine in different phases, first you can roam your cave freely, molding the walls at your discretion by simply pushing and pulling into them to create the rooms needed to channel energy into the earth or create upgrades for your character, summon monsters to aid you, etc. When a timer runs out you proceed to a menu-based interface from which you control the energy production and decide what to upgrade, equip, etc. rinse and repeat for a new turn. Each turn brings new challenges in the form of surface-dwelling adventurers, which you must fight with your weapons and magic spells while attempting to build your rooms. 

Whenever you reach a certain quota of energy production you get to move on to another scenario in a different cave. As mentioned you can create summon rooms to invoke creatures that can aid you in combat, help you gather energy and other resources, etc. etc. 

Depending on how you place you rooms according to certain Feng-Shui principles you get bonuses and upgrades and you will also face cave-dwelling monsters that you must defeat and other NPCs that may or may not aid you.</desc>

    <desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies. </desc>

The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose. </desc>

This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

    <name>Cyber Knight  </name>
    <desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

    <name>Cyber Knight II - Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou  </name>
    <desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

    <name>Cyborg 009  </name>
    <desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

    <name>Daikaijuu Monogatari  </name>
    <desc>The magical land of Shelldorado is populated by creatures who look like beasts, but possess a great wisdom despite their appearance. A long time ago, the land was attacked by the Demon King Fattobajah. The Demon King was only defeated by the power of the four great elemental shells - Fire Shell, Water Shell, Air Shell, and Earth Shell. In the ultimate battle, Fattobajah was sealed by the magical Aura Balls, and the Balls themselves were sealed in a crypt in Dorado City, so that the Demon King could never reawaken.

Years have passed, and a disaster occurred. Several meteors  fell to earth, causing huge tidal waves. The Shell-beasts realize it must be another Aura Ball, one they have not sealed. They call the Hero of the Fire Shell back to Shelldorado. He must seal the new Aura Ball, but he can do that only after finding the other Shell heroes. The Hero of the Fire Shell is you...

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with random battles and turn-based combat, viewed from semi-third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. There are a lot of party members to recruit, the Shell heroes as well as optional, secret characters. The party members you find might have a unique skill which can be required to solve puzzles. At one point in the game, you'll also be able to build your own town.</desc>

The player usually controls the Third Reich as a default but it can be changed prior to the game. The action takes place on both the Eastern Front and the Western front. The final battle involves either defending Berlin or attempting to occupy it. Like most Daisenryaku games, airplanes can only be manufactured on airports, ships can only be manufactured on docks, and land-based units can only be manufactured on urban hexes that are closest to the headquarters. Dive bombers can destroy cities and airports, destroying people and supplies. Even when retreating, enemy combatants can still catch up to the retreating units and knock them out, providing that they have enough ammo and gasoline to do the job.</desc>

    <name>Dark Half  </name>
    <desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>

    <name>Dark Law - Meaning of Death  </name>
    <desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

    <name>Der Langrisser  </name>
    <desc>"Der Langrisser" is a sequel to the game that was known outside of Japan as  Warsong, and is in fact a remake of the Genesis game  Langrisser II.

The Blue Dragon Knights of the Rayguard Empire are trying to steal the virtuous sorceress Riana. Their goal is to make her serve the evil Emperor Bozel, whose intention is to find the most powerful evil sword in the land, the Alhazard. Naturally, the main hero of the game, the knight Elwin, has not only to rescue Riana, but to retrieve the legendary holy sword Langrisser, the only artifact that is more powerful than Alhazard. At first, Elwin automatically follows the "good" path, but as the game progresses, he can choose whether to continue being good, to become an ally with Rayguard, or to side with the forces of Chaos whose goal is utter destruction.

"Der Langrisser" features a complex character creation process, during which you must answer morally ambiguous questions,  Ultima-style, that will determine the class and the attributes of the main hero. The game is a strategy RPG in which you control your party only during battles. You just hire soldiers and unite them under commands of generals. When your units attack the enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also use magic spells to heal your troops or to harm enemy soldiers.</desc>

    <name>Do-Re-Mi Fantasy - Milon no Dokidoki Daibouken  </name>
    <desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across.  

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green.  With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits.  Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red.  If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life.  There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

    <name>Dossun! Ganseki Battle  </name>
    <desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines. </desc>

    <desc>Dragon Ball Z: Super But?den was the first fighting game based on the Dragon Ball Z franchise and the first to introduce the split-screen mode to the games, where the screen is split in two whenever one of the two combatants moves away too far to keep them both shown in a single screen. This title features the adventures of Goku from the battle against Piccolo in the martial arts tournament to the conclusion of the Cell Games. 
 
The initially available characters are Goku (without SSJ), Vegeta (without SSJ), C-20, C-16, Piccolo, Freezer, C-18 and Original Cell. But upon entering the right code you can expand the list with Future Trunks (SSJ), Gohan (SSJ), Perfect Cell, Goku (SSJ), and Vegeta (SSJ), all of them relegated to occasionally appear in the Story Mode either as rivals or as alternative selectable characters. 
 
In the story mode, players select which fighter to pit against each opponent as while advancing rounds leading up to the battle against Perfect Cell. Players can also go one-on-one against another player or a CPU opponent. There is also a martial arts tournament mode, to play against eight players or CPU opponents in a elimination tournament.</desc>

    <desc>Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (known as Dragon Ball Z: Ultime Menace in France) is the last installment to the Super Butoden series for the SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin Buu saga. Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one available as a secret character: Future Trunks.

Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can now fly up or down while on the same screen as your opponent. You can also struggle with your rival pushing with your arms together to test your button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as well.

The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another player. This makes Super Butouden 3 the only game of the series without a Story Mode,. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released the Buu saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV. </desc>

    <name>Dragon Ball Z - Super Gokuu Den - Totsugeki Hen  </name>
    <desc>The first of the two "interactive fighters" for SNES based on the famous manga series Dragon Ball. "Totsugeki Hen" tells the story of the hero, Son Goku, following the first volume of the manga. The boy Son Goku meets a mysterious girl named Bulma, and she sends him on a mission to obtain the magical Dragon Balls. Naturally, Bulma is not the only one needing those Balls, so that the young hero will soon have to face and defeat some bad guys, including his first true rival Piccolo.

The game puts you in control of Son Goku only during battles or when there is a possibility to make a choice and to influence the storyline. There is no other gameplay in the game except fighting and picking answers from menu. The fights are one-on-one: you pause them by pressing the start button, and then program Son Goku, making him execute various moves: dash, kick, special attack, etc. Every attack can be countered by an enemy attack, and you have to follow the enemy's move pattern in order to attack and defend successfully. </desc>

    <desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls. </desc>

    <desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items. </desc>

    <desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively. </desc>

It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States. </desc>

    <desc>A young boy has a strange dream every night, where a voice calls him. In this dream there's a magical kingdom called Enderia. The queen of Enderia and her daughters were kidnapped by the demon Akuma, who now reigns supreme. The boy must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility. 
 
Yume Meiky?: Kigurumi Daib?ken is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master series template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc. 
 
When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.</desc>

There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade.

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

    <desc>The game's story begins with Filena, a girl raised as a boy by her grandfather Zenna. Filena is raised as a boy because the Empire ruling the country forces girls into prostitution and turns boys into gladiators. After turning 16 Filena prepares to make her debut in the imperial coliseum, however before the battle she and her fellow gladiators are assigned concubines. Filena ignores her assigned bedmate, Lila, but Lila forces her way into Filena's room and learns the truth about her gender. Filena later fights through the gladiator ranks and discovers that their battles to the death are all scripted by behind-the-scenes writers. Filena then sets off with Lila on a quest to bring down an empire and reclaim her rightful place in a lost kingdom.</desc>

    <name>Emerald Dragon  </name>
    <desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

    <name>Feda - The Emblem of Justice  </name>
    <desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

    <name>Final Fantasy IV  </name>
    <desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

    <desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

    <name>Final Fantasy VI  </name>
    <desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

The game uses the same turn-based strategy gameplay as its predecessors, but changes up the promotion system by making it entirely level-based, adds RPG-style status effects, and introduces the concept of the weapons triangle, in that a sword is strong against an axe, spear against the sword, and axe against the spear. Seisen no Keifu also featured much larger maps than previous titles (though a lower number of them -- 12 in all) and a handful of new units, such as the Troubadour, Dragon Master, and Falcon Knight. The game was released late in the Super Famicom's lifecycle in Japan and never published internationally. </desc>

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken. </desc>

    <name>Front Mission  </name>
    <desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the "Larcus Incident" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed "Carrion Crow". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

    <name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard  </name>
    <desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there... 
 
Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely. 
 
Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

    <name>Fushigi no Dungeon 2 - Fuurai no Shiren  </name>
    <desc>The legend of the Golden Condor... from village to village and  from town to town, everybody speak of it - somewhere, beyond forests and mountains, there lies an idyllic Golden Land, the land of eternal happiness. Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest. </desc>

    <name>G.O.D - Mezame yo to Yobu Koe ga Kikoe  </name>
    <desc>The year is 1999. A boy named Gen lives together with his mother in a small Japanese city. One day he goes to the nearby mountains and discovers an underground cave. In this cave, he encounters a strange bat-like creature guarding what appears to be a huge diamond. When Gen approaches the diamond, the floor crumbles, and all he can see is a group of aliens descending on the Earth...

Gen is awakened by a man in a military uniform. He quickly gets up, and notices a calender. The year is 2009! Ten years have passed, of which there is no recollection in Gen's memory. The world has changed a lot during those years. Aliens have invaded the Earth, many cities are destroyed, and he find himself amidst the members of an underground resistance movement. Now he has to travel all over the world, help the humans in their struggle, and discover the secret of the invasion.

The game is a console-style RPG with randomly encountered enemies whom you fight in turn-based combat viewed from "over-the-shoulder" perspective, similar to Phantasy Star IV. Gen and other party members develop special powers called "chakra", which can be leveled up just like the characters themselves.</desc>

    <name>Galaxy Wars  </name>
    <desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game. Players launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. The missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired from the spacecraft. The player controls the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft moves increases as their numbers decrease. 
 
 
 Once all spacecrafts have been destroyed another wave starts. The speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid. There are 3 game modes. Black &amp; white and color recreate the graphics and behavior of the original arcade game, whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behavior. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

Again, you (and your partner, in 2 player mode) control Goemon, his friend Ebisu-Maru and, new to the bunch, robot Sasuke, through loads of action stages and villages. Another new feature comes with 3D boss fights, featuring the giant mech type robot called "Goemon Impact". </desc>

    <desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness. </desc>

    <desc>The 4th title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. The game takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet. The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

    <desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

    <desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

    <desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

    <name>Gourmet Sentai Barayarou  </name>
    <desc>In Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou the player picks from three characters: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien. Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

    <desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is… a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute’s aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, you’ll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments. </desc>

    <desc>In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

    <desc>Hong Kong 97, stylized as HONGKONG1997 on the game's cover, is a 1995 unlicensed multidirectional shooter made for the Super Famicom in disk drive format by HappySoft Ltd., a Japanese homebrew game company. It was designed by the Japanese game journalist Kowloon Kurosawa, who said the game was made in two days. The game has gained a cult following in Japan and Taiwan for its notoriously poor quality, considered to be a kusoge. The game is set around the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. People from the Chinese Mainland started immigrating to Hong Kong and greatly increased the crime rate. As a countermeasure, Chin (Jackie Chan in his Wheels on Meals appearance), an unspecified relative of Bruce Lee, was hired by the Hong Kong government (represented by Chris Patten) to wipe out all 1.2 billion people in China. But meanwhile, in China, research was underway to bring the dead Tong Shau Ping (Deng Xiaoping) back to life as the "ultimate weapon". When the game was released in 1995, Deng Xiaoping, said to be dead in the game, was still alive. However, he did die months before the handover in 1997, which is when the game's plot actually takes place</desc>

    <desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat. </desc>

The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

    <desc>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of. 
 
Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</desc>

In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

    <name>Kirby no Kirakira Kids  </name>
    <desc>A Tetris-like puzzle game. There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types: 
 
Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score. 
 
Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared. 
 
Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. 
 
Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way. 
 
The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.</desc>

    <desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells. </desc>

    <desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

    <desc>This is Atlus' remake of Namco's two first Megaten games for NES. Graphics were improved to fit SNES standard, and there were some slight changes made to the interface (to resemble the classic look of  Shin Megami Tensei, especially in the first game).

The first  Megami Tensei follows the story of Nakajima, a programmer who has to become a devil summoner in order to stop an invasion from another world. Dungeon navigation and battles are viewed from first person perspective.

 Megami Tensei II puts you in the role of a nameless hero, a member of Devil Buster group who fight demons in a post-apocalyptic world that was caused by an atomic explosion in the end of the 20th century. Dungeon navigation gets a new top-down view in this sequel. </desc>

    <name>Laplace no Ma  </name>
    <desc>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. 
This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre,  Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

    <name>Last Bible III  </name>
    <desc>"Last Bible III" is a sequel to two Last Bible games for GameBoy and GameBoy Color. You control Shieru, a young boy who lives in a small village on a planet with a medieval civilization. With the help of his friends, he should fulfill an ancient prophecy and defeat the evil that threatens the planet. In order to do that, the heroes of the game have to recruit demons who will help them in battles.

As a part of Megaten universe, "Last Bible III" is focused on demon summoning and fusion. The concept is more developed in this game, since demons are now fully customizable characters that can level up and be equipped just like human party members. Unlike most Megaten games, "Last Bible III" is set in a medieval environment and has a more traditional flair. The battles are viewed from first person perspective in a standard Megaten fashion, but movement on the world map, in towns and in dungeons is controlled from third person perspective with a top-down view. </desc>

    <desc>This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is know outside of Japan as  Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</desc>

    <desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

    <desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

The introduction shows the Six Heroes in the middle of this confrontation. Flaus, the priestess of Valis, is slain in battle. The hero Beld, enraged, invokes a demonic power to defeat the god. But when the battle is over, the heroes disappear...

The game begins with Karla the Grey Witch, one of the Six Heroes, alone in a strange place, her powers lost. After completing Karla's scenario, the player is taken to the scenarios of the other heroes, and finally finds out what happened to all of them.

Record of Lodoss War is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, world map, and randomly appearing enemies. However, the battles have a strategic edge, allowing the characters to move on the battle field freely. The battles take place on an isometric screen. Characters can also acquire unique abilities, such as for example Karla's ability to possess bodies of other people.</desc>

    <name>Mahou Poi Poi Poitto!  </name>
    <desc>Mahou Poi Poi Poitto! ("Magic Poi Poi Poitto!") is a puzzle game developed by Metro and published by TAKARA for the Arcade and SNES. It plays similarly to other match-3 games of the era, like Columns, in that the player has to line up three identical pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Pieces fall in square clumps of four, sometimes including cloud pieces which immediately vanish, and very rarely including a sun icon that can remove all the icons of a single type. 
 
The game features a competitive two-player mode and a one-player story mode. In the story mode, the player takes on a series of monsters. The monster intermittently casts spells at the player that randomly transforms blocks into "enemy blocks". By casting magic back at the monster, best done by creating chains and combos, the ground beneath them moves towards the ceiling. Once high enough, the monster is crushed and the player moves onto the next stage.</desc>

    <desc>The sequel to "Majin Tensei" is a strategy RPG that takes place in an alternate Tokyo of 1996. You control a group of three special agents whose task is to stop a demonic invasion from a different reality.

The gameplay consists of large strategic battles. You move on the battle field, trying to complete your mission and exterminate the demons on your way. Attacking (or being attacked by) a demon results in a short auto-battle sequence.

"Spiral Nemesis" contains many classical Megaten elements, such as demon classification, Light/Dark and Law/Chaos alignment axis, etc. </desc>

Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi. 
 
At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky. 
 
"Whew, woosh!" 
 
And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head. 
 
"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!" 
 
The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</desc>

    <desc>Mickey to Donald: Magical Adventure 3 (the former sub-title translated to "Mickey &amp; Donald") is a side-scrolling platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan on December 8, 1995.nnnnThe sequel to The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey &amp; Minnie (and the third and final game in Disney's "Magical Quest" trilogy), Magical Adventure 3 follows Disney mascots Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck as they traverse through Storybook Land to rescue Donald's duckling nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the evil King Pete.nnnnAlong with a new fantasy setting, the game revamps both the two-player co-operative and magical costume mechanics by having each costume work differently for each playable character. In addition, players can use their costume's powers for the other player's benefit (for example, Mickey can stand on Donald's barrel armor to float above water).nnnnThe game was later ported to the Game Boy Advance and released in Japan on November 21, 2003. It later received a translated release in North America (on March 19, 2004) and Europe (on June 14, 2005) as Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey &amp; Donald.</desc>

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races.

Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to  7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock"  four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in  Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

    <desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

Pokonyan collects food items along the way - each of which adds to a bonus after the stage is complete - and Pokonyan can jump, sprint and change shape with his powers. His other forms give him stronger jumping and attacking capabiltiies, depending on the shape.</desc>

    <desc>Popeye Ijiwaru Majo: Sea Hag no Maki ("Popeye and the Harassing Witch Sea Hag") is a Popeye platformer-action game from Technos Japan. After Popeye trounces his nemesis the Sea Hag, she gets her revenge by separating all of Popeye's friends from their lifeforce, causing them to turn to stone. Popeye has to recover all their life energy (in the form of hearts) from a board game-like grid while avoiding the various heavies that have been sent to deter him, including his rival Bluto who is hoping to win Olive Oyl's heart by rescuing her first.nnnnEach stage takes place in a grid, and Popeye moves around by rolling a die and moving one to six spaces around the board. Some tiles allow him to purchase upgrades, recover health, move to other map squares and play through small platforming sequences. Occasionally, Popeye can bump into moving enemies on the map (similar to the overworld enemies in Super Mario Bros. 3) and fight a quick one-on-one battle with them for bonuses. His goal is to land on every square with a heart on it and find the heart in the stage somewhere. By collecting them all, Popeye saves a friend and moves onto the next board.nnnnThe game was released only in Japan for the Super Famicom.</desc>

    <desc>The game is based on an animé of the same name. In the kingdom of Whistler, the best fighters are young, beautiful women, proficient in many styles of combat. Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.

The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks.</desc>

    <desc>Psycho Dream is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming elements, similar in style to Valis games, though less story-driven. The game is set in predominantly modern-day environments. The player can choose to control either Ryo Shizima or Maria Tobari, two demon hunters who must save an innocent girl named Sayaka and rid the world of rampaging monsters. The two protagonists share the same stages; only single-player mode is available.nnnnBoth demon hunters rely mostly on close-range attacks - Ryo with a sword, Maria with a whip, though they can also use guns. Most of the gameplay consists of slowly walking through monster-infested areas, eliminating enemies and avoiding obstacles, which often requires jumping and ducking. Power-ups are obtained from fallen foes. Depending on their color, these power-ups can increase the attack level of a weapon, envelop the character in a protective force field, or restore his/her health. Rare red power-ups are unique to each character: Ryo dons a special armor that hits enemies with bouncing lasers, while Maria gets in touch with her angelic nature, growing wings and firing homing energy balls.</desc>

    <name>Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou  </name>
    <desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl). </desc>

    <desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

    <name>Romancing Saga  </name>
    <desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

    <name>Rudra no Hihou  </name>
    <desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to  choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells.

    <desc>SD The Great Battle is a top-down platformer/shooter that features characters from the Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Mobile Suit Gundam universes. It is the first game in what would be known as the Compati Hero Series. As well as for stylistic reasons, characters are super deformed -- turned into cartoonish caricatures with large heads and small bodies -- so that characters from the three franchises can be depicted at heights comparative to one another. Normally, Kamen Rider characters are human-sized whereas most Gundam Mobile Suits and Ultraman (and his kaiju opponents) are around 50-200 feet tall.</desc>

    <desc>Trials of Mana is set in the same world as the two previous Mana games (Final Fantasy Adventure, and Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Trials of Mana. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers. 
 
The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Charlotte the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawkeye the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole. 
 
Trials of Mana, like the previous game in the series, is an action RPG with real time combat.</desc>

    <desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers. </desc>

As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction.

and are now lost...

"Shin Megami Tensei If..." is a follow-up to the two classic SNES games. You choose your main character in the beginning of the game (by default it is the girl Tamaki, a character from the future  Persona series). Something weird is happening in the perfectly ordinary Karukozaka high school. One of the students made contact to a different universe that co-exists with modern-day Japan. With the help of your fellow students, you must investigate the matter and stop the insane plans of the student.

The gameplay contains typical Megami Tensei features such as demon summoning, demon fusion, and the ability to talk to enemies before (or instead of) fighting them. Enemies will react differently depending on your approach during conversation. The battles utilize a turn-based engine.</desc>

    <desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and   the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents  Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

    <name>Sound Factory    </name>
    <desc>Sound Fantasy was a game planned for release around 1994. An early title for this game was Sound Factory. Sound Fantasy was the creation of Toshio Iwai. A glimpse of the final version of the game came during an exhibition of Iwai's work during the release of Electroplankton for the DS in 2005 (see the article on this exhibition by IGN). There, the box art for the Japanese version of the game was displayed. Electroplankton is no doubt inspired by Sound Fantasy (and the PC game SimTunes). The game was also produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi. During a tribute to Yokoi at an art show in Tokyo in 2010, Iwai played the final version of Sound Fantasy. Also displayed was a promotional poster for the game that gives details on its release date. It says that it would be released in October (presumably 1994) for 6800 yen, and 9800 yen with the mouse included</desc>

    <name>Spark World </name>
    <desc>Spark World is a maze action game structurally similar to Bomberman where the protagonists are anthropomorphized cop cars fighting other sentient cars in a series of themed mazes. It was released exclusively in Japan in 1995. 
 
The goal of each stage is to defeat all the other opponents, though focusing on collecting power-ups is also important to overpower each stage's foes. Depending on the enemy vehicle type, they also have innate powers that the player does not. The player eventually faces a boss after a certain number of battle stages in each zone. 
 
The game also features a multiplayer Battle mode, which provides a number of customization and stage options.</desc>

    <desc>A young boy named Ratix lives in the town Clatos on a planet with medieval culture, together with his best friends Dorn and Milly. They belong to respectable families of warriors and healers, and excel in battles kills. One day, a letter from a neighbor town arrives. A strange disease has plagued the town and its inhabitants plead the healers of Clatos to help them. Milly's father decides to go, but he himself catches the disease. The young adventurers must save Milly's father and other people at all costs. But in the beginning of their journey, they discover a crashed space ship with people who belong to a much more advanced civilization. People from two different worlds must work together to solve the grand mystery...

This RPG contains some interesting gameplay details, such as Approval Rating: people like or dislike each other and their behavior towards Ratix and within the party might change depending on their feelings to him and your own actions. The combat is fast-paced, real-time: you control Ratix, while other party members are AI-controlled. You can customize combat tactics by assigning roles to your comrades, and you can pause the combat at any time to make strategic decisions.</desc>

    <desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. </desc>

While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

    <desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

The game makes a few significant changes to the original Super Gussun Oyoyo. The most apparent of which is its new setting of a tropical island with an active volcano: many stages will start dropping fireballs the longer the player takes, which must be avoided at all costs. The game also features a new "Puzzle Mode" which plays similarly to those found in Tetris sequels: the player has a limited number of pre-determined pieces and must figure out how to use them to get their little bald friend to the end.</desc>

Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats. </desc>

    <desc>Super Ninja-Kun is a 1994 Japan-only side-scrolling action game developed and published by Jaleco for the SNES. It is a graphically updated version of UPL's Ninja-kun Arcade games from the 1980s, which Jaleco had previously adapted for consoles (as well as creating their own spin-offs, named Ninja Jajamaru-kun).nnnnAs well as featuring 16-bit graphics the game now also features a story mode, bosses, an upgradable health gauge (the Arcade game only allowed Ninja-kun to take a single hit) and multiple weapon types. Ninja-kun can also create a powerful one-off magic blast by collecting the souls of dead enemies as they float off the screen. The game also includes a two-player cooperative mode.nnnnSuper Ninja-kun is not to be confused with Super Ninja Boy, another ninja-themed action game for the SNES.</desc>

Aside from Super Robot Wars EX, the plotline wasn't given much attention before; the main focus was on Bian Zoldark's Divine Crusaders (Super Robot Wars 2) and later the threat of the Inspectors (Super Robot Wars 3) and Guests (Super Robot Wars 4).nnnnPart 1 of the game elaborates on the background of Masaki Andou, explaining how Masaki became the pilot of the Cybuster and how he came to hate Shu Shirakawa. This part ends with Shu escaping to the surface and Masaki chasing after him, setting up the latter's introduction into SRW2. Part 2 takes place after the end of the war with the Guests (SRW4), and follows Masaki's and Shu's battles in La Gias.nnnnThis game was released before SRW4 was retconned in favor of Super Robot Wars F and F Final; however, the changes don't affect the Masou Kishin plot.</desc>

    <desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

    <desc>Super Tekkyuu Fight! ("Super Iron Ball Fight!") is a maze action game featuring characters from the Compati Hero Series, which combines the worlds of Ultraman, SD Gundam, Kamen Rider and the original character Fighter Roar. Rather than relying on explosives, as is the case in the structurally similar Bomberman series, each character has a ball and chain which allows them to damage opponents and destroy blocks. They can acquire bonuses that increases the size of the ball, which causes it to do more damage, and the length of the chain, which increases its range. 
 
The game features a single-player mode where the player takes one of the four protagonists through a series of maze stages that can be attempted in any order, each of which concludes with a boss fight. It also features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete for supremacy across a number of stages. Many enemies in the single-player mode use other weapons, like guns, missiles and flamethrowers.</desc>

    <name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss   </name>
    <desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

    <desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

    <path>./Sutte Hakkun (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
    <name>Sutte Hakkun  </name>
    <desc>Sutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks â€” that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then â€” and sucking potions â€” that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid â€” from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible. 
 
Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.</desc>

It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

    <desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies. </desc>

Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

    <name>Treasure Hunter G  </name>
    <desc>Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting. Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

Your standard-attacks include a shock wave and the ability to fly. </desc>

Yakisoban is obviously a bit dense, as he's standing at the altar and doesn't even realize Mayumi is not there until part-way through the ceremony.</desc>

    <desc>Uchu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's is based on the anime Tekkaman Blade, also known as Teknoman. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

    <desc>Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban is the third game in the Ultra Baseball (Baseball Simulator in the USA) series. It was released in 1992 for the Super Famicom by Culture Brain exclusively in Japan. The game remains much the same as the previous 1991 Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 with some new additions. This title included real life players from the NPB league; the word Jitsumeiban means Real Player Version. Additionally a World Series championship and an All-Stars option was added to this version. 
 
In the game, there are three leagues: Central, Pacific and Ultra. Each league has six teams. In the Ultra League, pitchers and batters have special power-ups that boost their abilities which gives the game a surrealistic feel that is rare in the sports genre. Players can even create their own baseball teams and assign special moves to the players that they name themselves. The game can be played in exhibition, season or All-Stars modes. 
 
Though the game was never released worldwide, an unofficial English translation was created by VX Translations</desc>

The game was fan translated in late 2016.nnnnThrob of the Demon's Heart is distinctive for the Wizardry series for adapting a lot of Japanese imagery and monsters in the familiar Wizardry format. This gives it a more home-grown feel among the Japanese-exclusive spin-offs, and heavily draws from Japanese folklore and religion.nnnnIt is the first Wizardry Gaiden to be released on a system other than the Nintendo Game Boy, and is also the last in the series. Many more Japanese Wizardry spin-off games would follow, however.</desc>

    <desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not. </desc>

In this fifth installment of the series, the combat has been somewhat simplified to resemble a more classical action RPG style. Adol can fight monsters using melee and magical techniques, and defend himself by pressing the Y button at the right time. The ability to jump has been also added. </desc>

    <name>Yu Yu Hakusho - Tokubetsu Hen </name>
    <desc>YuYu Hakusho: Tokubetsu Hen ("YuYu Hakusho: Special Edition") is a fighting game for the Super Famicom. Rather than controlling the character directly with the d-pad and buttons, the players charge attacks and unleash them at the right amount of power. Combat is depicted as a series of dramatic cutaways as each fighter launches their attacks and the other tries to defend or evade them.nnnnYuYu Hakusho, an anime series about a teenage delinquent that is recruited by the underworld to fight demons and spirits that have escaped into the normal world, saw multiple adaptations for the Super Famicom and other consoles. Most are straightforward fighter games, though this and its predecessor YuYu Hakusho use this timing-based variant.</desc>

    <desc>YuYu Hakusho 2: Kakutou no Sho is the second of four Namco-developed Super Famicom adaptations of the YuYu Hakusho manga and anime, featuring the delinquent student Yusuke who becomes a spirit world investigator after he passes away. While its predecessor, YuYu Hakusho, featured a combat system that was turn-based and tactical, Kakutou no Sho is instead a standard example of the four-button fighter game model that became popular after the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II.</desc>

    <name>Yume Meikyuu - Kigurumi Daibouken  </name>
    <desc>A young boy has a strange dream every night, where a voice calls him. In this dream there's a magical kingdom called Enderia. The queen of Enderia and her daughters were kidnapped by the demon Akuma, who now reigns supreme. The boy must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility. 
 
Yume Meiky?: Kigurumi Daib?ken is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master series template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc. 
 
When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.</desc>
