description:
	A side-scrolling sci-fi shooter, Gleylancer casts you as Lucia, a young pilot in the Space Fleet of starfighters that hijacks the experimental Gleylancer fighter to go explore the outer borders of known space in search of her missing father. Along the way Lucia will have to shoot down dozens of enemies in standard shooter fashion, while avoiding destruction and collecting power-ups that extend her ship's energy, upgrade weapons and gather screen-clearing bombs.
	.
	The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks. Features only a single-player campaign with two different endings depending on how the final stages are completed (e.g. if Lucia's father is rescued or not).

description:
	Streets of Rage 3 aimed to build on the success of its predecessor, so while the style of gameplay and control scheme is largely identical to its predecessors, significant changes were made to the overall structure of the game. Streets of Rage 3 is a faster paced release with longer levels, a more complex plot (which in turn leads to more in-depth scenarios complete with interactive levels and multiple endings) and the return of traps such as pits. Dash and dodge moves were added to each character's arsenal of moves, and weapons can now only be used for a few times before breaking.
	Changes to the fighting mechanics allows for the integration of weapons with certain movesets. Team attacks, absent from Streets of Rage 2 but available in the original Streets of Rage, make a return, and are occasionally used by enemies too. Blitz moves, performed while running, have also been altered and are now upgradable over the course of the game (predicated on how many points are earned per level). Death causes a downgrade, however holding the X button before a series of button combinations can give players access to the upgraded moveset at any point in the game, at the expense of the time taken to perform attacks.
	Enemies are also smarter with weapons, and some can even steal health upgrades, and there are also several secret playable characters, unlockable after overcoming certain conditions during the game. Special moves also no longer drain the user's health - a separate, automatically regenerating bar is introduced for this purpose.

	Gil Hazard, president of the Hazard Foundation, is secretly Professor G, the leader of the evil Dark Hazard organization. He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.
	.
	Battle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.

	It wasn't supposed to appear on the Genesis at all -- Sega's 16-bit system was well past its commercial prime by the late 1990's, even on the hand-me-down/bedroom system basis that tends to keep a trickle of kids' titles coming late in a console's life.  And it never did in any legal form.  But enterprising Asian game pirates saw an opportunity to cash in on Sega and Disney in one go, and thus this wholly unlicensed conversion of the GameBoy Color version of A Bug's Life appeared on the Genesis:

There are also homing missiles, smart bombs, speed-ups, and an option that can be placed on any side of the ship. The ship also has a shield which can absorb damage from smaller bullets, meaning it can take a few hits before exploding unless it's hit by an enemy ship, part of the landscape or some special enemy weapons that just ignore the shield.

	Christmas is a time where people get together and give others presents and spend all day eating food. But there's only one problem this year. You see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his house. There won't be any Christmas if Santa doesn't stop them.
	.
	In Daze Before Christmas, you're Santa. According to the game's Christmas calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse,  but also Mr. Weather.
	.
	Santa's health is represented by five Santa hats. When Santa is hit by any one of his enemies, one hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then he will lose a life. He will then have to restart at the beginning of the area, unless he passes a gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore each area, Santa can collect presents that contain a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or he may release an elf. Santa should be careful when opening these presents as some of them may contain bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a spinning star, he must get it as this will take him to the next area.
	.
	Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. In almost each area, Santa can get a cup of hot cocoa. Doing this will transform him into Anti-Santa, a type of Santa who wears nothing but white, grows Satan's horns on top of his head, is invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in which he can use to bonk enemies with. The Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but this can be changed via the Options menu.
	.
	Daze acts like one of those platform games where you run through the level, shoot at enemies, and proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas where the gameplay changes, and these areas involve Santa flying through the sky in England, Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents in chimneys to score points. The game also uses a password-saving system, where entering a password given will allow gamers to restart at the beginning of a specific area, in case they happen to run out of lives.

This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.
	.
	The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, "normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

	Dynamite Headdy is a platformer... with a difference. You control a little character whose main attack comes from his disembodied head. Yes, years before Rayman appeared, we already had a hero who used detachable appendages to attack his enemies.
	.
	Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds â such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.

	Eliminate Down is a horizontally-scrolling shooter similar in style to Thunder Force. The player has several weapons that can be freely switched (forward shot, back shot, and missile), and can also change the speed of the ship. Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.
	.
	The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to Whack-a-Mole where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.

The player controls a P-51D Mustang plane through different missions, with many enemies on the screen at the same time and a large aircraft as a boss at the end of every mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. There are different power-ups to collect, providing additional fire power and new firing patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging many enemies at once.

description:
	This is one of the several games based on the animÃ© series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!
	.
	Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.
	.
	Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!

	"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose original title is Langrisser). The events of the game take place several years after those described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army to attack the neighboring countries, obviously searching for something. This "something" might be none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the Emperor!
	.
	"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.
	.
	The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake",  Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.

	Lion King 3 is a platform game released for the Sega Mega Drive based, not the Disney film of the same name, but the original film itself, as a follow-up to The Lion King II. It was developed by an unknown company likely connected to Chuanpu & Gamtec and published by X Boy.
	A second release does not credit X Boy but it is unknown if it was published by another company or by X Boy without their logo.
	In this game, players get the choice of playing as either Simba or Mufasa, although they play identically to one another, through several levels, each with a boss at the end, all while having to contend with various platforming hazards such as floating platforms, swings and all sorts of enemies that obstruct their path.
	Both lions possess the ability to attack with their claws using the B button and can fire a special attack, a energy wave that shoots straight forward, with the A button. Extra special attacks can be found throughout every level.
	Health can be restored in game by picking up hearts and lives can be gained by picking up a 1-up. Atop of this, a life is earnt by picking up 100 Sun Emblems with the counter resetting afterwards. Throughout each level, progress can be saved by leaping at an unlit torch, which will light and act as a Checkpoint.
	There is no story in-game and the ending screen is simply a shot of the player's lion gazing out across a lake as the word "FIN" appears overhead.
	Trivia
	Strangely enough, Simba's in-game sprite is coloured a pale pink. Atop of this, while his idle graphics are taken from The Lion King, every other sprite seems to be an original.
	On the same note, Mufasa' sprite is simply Adult Simba's from the same game.
	Even more so then with Mulan, this game takes almost every resource from other games, such as enemies from Donkey Kong Country and the background on the Stage Screen screen is from the Transylvania stage in QuackShot.
	Most bizarrely of all, this game contains many sound samples taken from games like The Lion King and Disney's Aladdin often distorted immensely and employed in appropriate places. For example, a bug will sound like a monkey and the sound effect played when you pause the game is a portion of Mufasa's sound bite from The Lion King, slowed down incredibly and cut off. It merely says: "Everything the".

	There are two playable characters: Simba and Mufasa, the latter can be played by collecting a golden star. Simba can be reaccessed when touching an enemy, and torches act as checkpoints; the player's lion can activate them by jumping up when next to a torch.

The fighting engine isn't taken from the official Mortal Kombat games and instead uses an engine similar to one used in some other pirated Mega Drive fighting games. All of the opponents in this game are clones of major Mortal Kombat characters. There are four levels, each with a different set of clones to fight.

She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs.
	.
	In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

description:
	Sega even had a third project running, this time for the Mega Drive. Once again, the development was done by a third party. This time it seems to have been the mostly unknown developer called Opus, as in-game art and the sound engine used indicate. This game was never released, probably due to quality issues, but a beta copy was leaked and can be played on emulators nowadays. The game would have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of beat-em-ups. It is obvious that it either was in a rather early development stage, or Sega did right to pull the plug on this botched mess.
	.
	The game features a lot of cut scenes, all of them in the finest Engrish. The chapter titles are in Japanese, though. The story doesn't make any sense, at least not in its presented state. Later in the game, you meet people you should know but don't, and about halfway through the game you get to know that your goal from the beginning was to rescue Ryu's kidnapped lady friend.

	The fairy kingdom has long been threatened by the dark witch Wool, the leader of the Dark Undulation. The queen Velvet sent the cute little fairy Silk to seek aid by the red-haired witch Cotton, the only one who could defeat Wool. Cotton agrees under one condition: she will receive some willows as a reward, since willows are her favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, she begins to chase the mysterious enemy.
	.
	"Panorama Cotton" is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter reminiscent of  Space Harrier, set in an animÃ©-style fantasy world. Various levels scroll "into the screen", vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can move Cotton over the screen, shooting at oncoming enemies and avoiding obstacles on her way. Cotton can upgrade her weapon to higher levels as you advance in the game, and can also cast magical spells by collecting special items.

	The Sno-Bees are back! One day in Antarctica, an asteroid crashes into the crystal that protects the penguins, shattering it into many pieces and freeing the Sno-Bees who had been frozen in ice. In order to rescue his people, the blue penguin (along with a pink penguin in two-player mode) goes after the Sno-Bees and to recover the missing pieces of the crystal. The game takes the basic template of the 1982 original and expands on it, offering a greater variety of enemies, various environmental hazards, and power-ups, along with of course updated 16-bit graphics and sound. The goal is still to push blocks and crush enemies. Enemies now appear from generators, which must be destroyed to stop new enemies from appearing, and all enemies must then be eliminated to complete each stage.
	.
	In addition to the main story mode, the game also features a competitive battle mode for up to four players, as well as a conversion of the original arcade game.

	In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance. Will you be able to uncover the mystery?

The Snow Bros use  snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.

	.
	3. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.
	.
	4. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.
	.
	These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.

description:
	Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.
	.
	The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between  Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.
	.
	The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.

C jumps, B picks up and throws crates, and A allows Chip or Dale to throw fireballs, assuming they have some in their inventory.

	Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.
	.
	In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling their own pieces simultaneously.
	.
	The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a line.

In the game, the graphics in stages three and four are based off those from Super Mario World. Stage three appears to outright lift level graphics straight from the SNES game, while stage four uses what appear to be original graphics based on the Super Mario World style. Unlike stage three though, stage four also has enemy sprites that are based off of Super Mario World enemies, including Koopas and Chargin' Chuck, and pigs that fly with parachutes, much like Para-bombs.

	This is a fighting game with 8 opponents and no repeats between them. Each character has their own special moves and one super move, along with 8 backgrounds that are not character specific. The backgrounds are cobbled together using elements of backgrounds found in several different games, including World Heroes, Street Fighter II, The King of Fighters '95, and Fatal Fury 2. The controls appear to be somewhat better than other Mega Drive pirated fighting games, such as Tekken 3 Special. However, the A button is unused, leaving B and C to be used for all attacks, similar to a NES fighting pirate.
	Each fight lasts until one fighter wins 1 or 3 rounds and each round can last for up to 30, 60 or 99 seconds, depending on the settings. The hit detection is poor, with many attacks that miss the opponent when they're supposed to hit them. The endings are minimal, with a portrait of your character on a simple "YOU ARE BEST.
