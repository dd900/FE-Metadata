    <path>./Alien Hominid (USA).nkit.gcz</path>
    <name>Alien Hominid</name>
    <desc>You're a little yellow alien.  The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.

The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</desc>

    <name>Baten Kaitos Origins </name>
    <desc>Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands.

The main character of the story is Sagi, a "Spirit-born" individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...

Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.

The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</desc>

    <name>Batman Begins</name>
    <desc>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened.

Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.

Certain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.</desc>

    <desc>In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.

You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.

There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). As the game progresses, a large story unfolds, even dealing with some social issues on the way.</desc>

    <desc>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.

Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</desc>

The setting for the game is a space station that has been overrun by hostile aliens. You play as a bad-ass soldier dude who will single-handedly wipe the aliens out.

You travel around each level in a non-linear fashion.  You have to fight your way through endless hordes to find keys, flip switches, use elevators, and then ultimately defeat a big boss at the end.</desc>

The "Hardcore Tour" mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an icecream man, or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also have to watch out for a health bar which accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.

Do well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well.. 

There's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two player split screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.</desc>

In the single-player game, players take on the roles of Bomberman and Max. Your goal is to stop the Hige Hige Bandits who plan to destroy Planet Bomber by crashing an artificial comet, Dark Star, into it. In this platforming quest, you will be aided by your use of bombs, and by Charaboms, creatures that you find that have their own special abilities that will help you progress through the game. After feeding a Charabom it will evolve, which will then make it more powerful. There are many types of Bombs and Charaboms to find throughout the single-player adventure.

Jetters also contains the classic Bomberman 4-player battles in which you and up to 3 friends basically blast each other with bombs until only 1 Bomberman remains. There is a revenge feature which keeps you in the action even after you lose. If you get blown up by a bomb, you appear on the exterior of the arena and can shoot bombs at players in the game, making sure that you can always be a part of the action.

There are 8 main battle arenas and many different types of multi-player battles. Bomberman Jetters was also originally released as a budget title for only $19.99, which made it less than half the price of most games when they first come out.</desc>

There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.

One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter."  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

    <desc>Activision's popular CABELA series is great for hunters in the off-season, and the 2006 entry in the series, CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 for the Game Cube, offers yet another great adventure in the outdoors. As usual, players will be traveling the world looking for the biggest and most dangerous game, which includes wolves, cougars, bears, and even polar bears. This time, the game takes players through Australia, Africa, Alaska, and even to the frozen tundra of Siberia as they stalk the most wanted game. Players will have several options when it comes to choosing guns, bullets, and other accessories. Animal calls, traps, decoys, and bait are all available for sell and use in the wild. As players move through the single player missions, however, they will be given tasks other than just hunting down specific game. Some levels require players to keep wild animals away from a camp, save lost hikers from grizzly bears, or help an injured forest ranger get back to town. One of the most interesting additions to the game is the inclusion of slow motion time. Players can slow down time to line up that perfect shot. Slow motion time only lasts for a few seconds, however, so players still have to be quick on aiming and firing. CABELAS hunting games are always great, and CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 is no exception. Gamers looking for the next big challenge in virtual hunting won't be disappointed.</desc>

    <name>Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO</name>
    <desc>Capcom VS SNK 2 is composed almost entirely of classic Street Fighter and SNK fighting techniques, which means lots of charge moves, half and quarter circles, and super moves. What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</desc>

    <desc>Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems. 

The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. 

The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</desc>

    <desc>Gamers take control of the Chibi Robo, a pint-sized machine designed specifically to take care of a family's house. The robot needs to keep the house "happy." To do that, Chibi must walk around the home and clean it up, interact with other machines and people, and even -- according to the storyline - stop a group of bumbling thieves from making off with precious valuables. An electricity counter located in the bottom-right corner of the screen constantly counts down. When Chibi is getting low, players will want to recharge. The game features a day and night system, where days last about 10 minutes and nights the same. The environments slightly change depending on the time of day. For instance, a character not available in the day might be sleeping on the couch at night, and robots normally roaming the level in the afternoon might be gone in the evening.</desc>

The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. 

In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.

Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</desc>

    <name>Cubivore - Survival of the Fittest</name>
    <desc>Cubivore is a "Call of the Wild" brought to an interactive media. Gento Matsumotos serene and surreal portrait of wilderness lost then civilization reverting (or progressing) to wilderness. The music though not long is of high quality and presents eerie and beautiful pieces. 
Of course the most obvious thing about Cubivore would be the graphics. 99% of all scenery and creatures in the game are made of cubes, rectangles, or squares. Even water ripples away from a falling step in squares. Blood pools in squares upon the ground and even the moon and sun appear as cubes in the sky. 

As you move through the game you will eat prey (Or sometimes outfight a predator) To gain new forms and power. The more forms you gain the more wilderness goes back to the land (This wilderness has recently been stolen by a rather nasty Killer cubivore). Naturally it is your goal to dethrone this killer of the wild and set your self up as king of the beast, thus filling the land once again with wilderness.</desc>

    <desc>This is the fourth installment in the Custom Robo series, but the first one to be released outside of Japan. On an unknown planet in the future, custom robos are used for criminal purposes. Those who can manipulate the robots through brain waves are called "Commanders". When you and your comrades learn of a strong, autonomous maneuvering robot, you decide to investigate the matter.

The game mixes action (fighting), simulation (assembling) and RPG elements (do some detective work to unravel the mystery) in a single game. You can construct your own robot with over 200 parts, including over 50 guns, 30 bombs, 30 pods and 15 legs. In a typical arena match, you have to fight real-time battles and victory means you can acquire new parts and continue with the storyline. As there are different kinds of battles (two-on-two, tag team, four-player battle royale), you have to use different strategies and make use of the obstacles in the arena.</desc>

    <name>Dead to Rights</name>
    <desc>Dead To Rights is an action-game, straight out.  You play as Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City.  On a routine call, you find a dead body; the body is your father.  Later framed, Jack becomes a fugitive, on the run from the law.

Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate.

Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word.  When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion.  When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform "disarm" moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker.  Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress.

A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack's best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog.  Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow's jaws.

Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of "Bullet-Time" from Max Payne.  You can perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving you an advantage, as long as your adrenaline holds out.</desc>

Developed by AKI Corporation, whose previous experience in the genre includes titles WWF No Mercy and WCW/NWO Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta offers an estimated 1,500 animations for each of the 45 included characters.

EA combines the game-making prowess of Aki and the boisterous characters from hip-hop's Def Jam Records. The result is Def Jam Vendetta, a curious concoction that just might have the goods to attract hardcore and mainstream gamers alike. The game features 12 Def Jam artists including Redman, Method Man, Ludacris, DMX, N.O.R.E., and Scarface.

Eddy is the fearless leader, eager to make a quick buck; Ed is the tall, strong and stupid one, while Edd (or Double-Dee) is the smart, polite neat-freak, who communicates with his family through sticky notes. Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures allows you to play as the trio through a series of levels, called 'scams'. Each level is a get-rich-quick scheme dreamed up by Eddy, allowing the Eds to get some jawbreakers. Each level can be accessed via the hub world, the 'Cul-de-sac', where the Eds have their adventures and meet other neighborhood kids. Players control all three Eds; more specifically, they're always in control of an Ed, and the other two tag along. You can switch your Ed at any time with the press of a button. Each Ed has their own abilities: Eddy can hurl stink bombs and form a tower to reach high objects, Ed can dig in sandpits, lift and throw objects, and charge at things to smash them, while Double Dee can use his slingshot, activate machines, and be thrown high into the air by the other two Eds.</desc>

    <desc>First console installment of the strategy-RPG series since the SNES days. Previously released on Famicom (Japan-only), Super Famicom (Japan-only), and Game Boy Advance, Fire Emblem leaves the 2D overhead maps of old behind to serve up 3D villages, fields, and caves, and polygonal battle sequences. The continent of Tellius is divided into humans and half-man/half-beast demi-humans. These two races have battled for centuries and only recently established an uneasy peace. Now, a new force threatens to tear apart the seven kingdoms and reignite the flames of war. Joining the Fire Emblem ranks are new units, such as such as the shape-shifting laguz who transform into beasts to attack their foes. Additionally, characters can now learn unique skills as they gain experience, giving players even more ways to customize their strategy.</desc>

    <desc>This cartoon style racing game replaces the usual kart formula with planes (and all sorts of flying technology, such as UFO's, flying carpets and plenty more). 

Choose from one of the many different, and wacky, characters and take to the sky over various locations, each with its own set of obstacles and shortcuts. Each character has a different level of ability (for example, one may be highly accurate in cornering but slow, while another is much faster but less responsive in turning).

Apart from the usual race modes, you can also take on a 4 player race (split-screen only).</desc>

    <name>Freekstyle</name>
    <desc>Freekstyle is a EA Sports' take on motocross racing.  This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks.  There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first.  The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total.

The racing game, or "Freekstyle" mode, combines racing and tricks.  You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way.  Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion.  If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.

Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</desc>

    <name>Future Tactics - The Uprising</name>
    <desc>The reality you know is under threat.

                The reality you know has been infected with a retroactive virus capable of rewriting history in its own image. The reality you know must end in order to save it.

                At an indeterminable point in mankind's future, ordered society has reverted to a feudal state, scattered groups of survivors huddling together in small villages and nomadic enclaves. Mankind is running scared of the greatest to it's existence since reality first sputtered into existence.

                Decades ago, the face of the planet changed, entire cities disappeared overnight, whole countries vanished. Left in their place were creatures, hideous shambling monstrosities, technologically advance, and yet intellectually retarded. And as mankind would soon discover, this was an enemy that could not be stopped and killed. Strike one down, and it would be reborn without so much as a scratch.

                In the dark years ahead, when our enemies are but warped reflections of ourselves, and where our allies may be more than they seem, a boy, his sister, and a rag-tag assembly of unlikely warriors are the planets last hope. But as they soon discover, immortality comes at a price. Twisting perceptions, time and emotions.

                Future Tactics is a tale of love, loss, hope...and some mean green ugly muthas.

                Features:
                * Nine beautifully crafted characters, each with unique weapons and attributes
                * Nineteen levels, each with varied landscapes and challenges from rural idylls to deserted cities complete with seasons
                * High explosive action combined with turn based strategy allows the player to choose the pace of progress
                * Advanced AI enemies that respond intelligently to your every move
                * Unlimited replay opportunities as the combination of a unique enemy AI and deformable landscapes means that no two games are ever the same
                * Compelling plot driven missions written by TV script writer Paul Rose (of East enders fame) complete with rich FMV story driven objectives at the beginning of each mission
                * Fully destructible landscapes, buildings and scenery.
                * Enjoy the story-driven campaign or challenge a friend for a thrilling duell!</desc>

Filming is done in the toon world and then sent to the real world for editing and production, thus reducing the tedium and cost of animation. However the animation industry is under heavy pressure from new computer generated techniques of animating. In an effort to revitalize traditional Cel animation the real world Studio SPUMCO will be creating a cartoon based on Extreme Skating. And so auditions begin in the Toon World.

The cast of characters are all Cel-Shaded and mostly anthropomorphisms. You will control one of them through eight large sets to try and be selected for the cartoon. You collect points by doing what you would do in any skateboarding game, grinding, jumping, the usual ticks. However,  here there is a twist. Seeing as you are a cartoon you can gain points by being beheaded crushed and other familiar animated antics. Sometimes a level will consist of a battle or a race.

The game also contains a two player versus mode.</desc>

    <desc>Adaptation of the airborne wizard soccer game featured in the Harry Potter books. Two teams comprised of seven players compete on broomsticks in the air. The quaffle, a floating sphere, acts as the equivalent to a soccer ball. Three "chasers" on each team offensively move the quaffle up and down the airborne stadium and attempt to hurl it through one of three existing goals. One "keeper," or goalie, on each end tries to block and return those attempts. Players must also watch out for "bludgers," or hard spheres with minds of their own that try to knock wizards off of their broomsticks, and the "snitch," a tiny golden sphere that pretty much guarantees a win.</desc>

Only after they successfully escape the beast's huge jaws do they all simultaneously wonder why it's hidden within the confines of the wizardry school and perhaps more intriguing still, what it could be guarding. So begins the tale of the Sorcerer's Stone, the first of author J.K. Rowling's incalculably popular books about "The Boy Who Lived." The videogame take on the book and popular first Potter movie duplicates the action adventure gameplay found in EA's previous Chamber of Secrets title.</desc>

    <desc>Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to Radiant Silvergun by Treasure, on the Sega Saturn.

Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black &amp; white sides of his ship during gameplay.
The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. 

This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</desc>

    <name>Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer</name>
    <desc>Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. 

PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description.

Game Play Modes:
Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. 

High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?

Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.

Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.

Multiplayer Modes:
Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to "push" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.

Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.

Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.

The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.

The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4

GBA description

Surf Modes:
Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on.

Challenge - Pick a surfer and do challenges around the world.

Drop In - Instant action surfing - go and just surf.

Multiplayer - With a Link Cable and another copy of the game you and a friend can link up to compete against each other.

The Pros are the same as above.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Waimea Bay, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.</desc>

    <desc>Kirby arrives on the Nintendo GameCube at warp speed in his first-ever racing game. Based on the same principles as games like Super Smash Brothers and past Kirby titles, Kirby Air Ride offers an entirely new approach to the racing genre. The ultra-easy controls give Kirby Air Ride instant playability no matter how skilled the players may be. You control Kirby with the analog stick and the A button -- that's it. The stick steers the character left and right (he accelerates perpetually) and the A button when pressed slows him down and when released delivers a temporary speed boost. The idea is to hold the button down around corners, drift them, and then shoot out with a burst of speed. The game features a four-player split-screen mode and LAN support for link-up play.</desc>

Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up.

    <desc>THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING for the Game Cube. This time, the game focuses on Spyro?s childhood and recounts the story of his first major battle with Cinder the Dragon. The game begins with Spyro hatching out of an egg and being raised by dragonflies. He has no idea that he?s a dragon, but once Spyro discovers this, he will have access to many of his dragon talents, including fire breathing and flying. He will need all of these abilities to take down the evil black dragon Cinder, who is plotting to resurrect an evil force and take over the world. A New Beginning focuses more on battle than platforming. Spyro?s breath attack can be modified with elemental powers, and each of these four elements has three different attacks that Spyro can access once he collects enough gems. Each attack has its own uses. In addition to elemental blasts, Spyro also has access to one fury move per element. These moves damage enemies across the entire screen. The flying levels work just like aerial shooters, with Spyro blasting his way through Cinder?s flying forces while dodging and spiraling out of the way of incoming blasts. These break up the combat missions and, together, turn THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING into a great game that explores Spyro?s past and turns him into the dragon hero everyone loves.</desc>

    <name>Luigi's Mansion</name>
    <desc>Luigi's Mansion pits you as Luigi, Mario's forgotten brother.

Luigi, while checking his mail, found out he won a mansion in a contest.  What's weird, is he never entered any contest to begin with.  Being the curious person he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the house.

Luigi sets forth through a dark and scary jungle to find the house, but sees that Mario is nowhere to be found.  Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts.  He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000.  Luigi must now make his way through the mansion's many rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can.

As you explore, you must solve mysteries, collect cash/gems/jewels/coins, and encounter boss characters.  Luigi's vacuum has the ability to suck up ghosts that have inhabited this strange mansion.  However, the ghosts will not give up so easily.  You must struggle with them and pull them back to catch your prey with your trusty vacuum.  As you continue to your goal, you must face off with the deceased denizens of the house and the boos that haunt it, and unlock new rooms with the keys you find along the way.  You can also gain special abilities for your vacuum, such as the ability to shoot fire, water, or ice.  Remember though, treasure is scattered everywhere.  Check all the objects for coins and paper money, and who knows, you may just make enough money for Luigi to buy a mansion of his own...

As you explore the strange mansion, the plot slowly unravels and it becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on in that haunted house.  Will you ever see your lost brother Mario again?</desc>

    <desc>Mario Party 6 builds upon the style and mechanics of its predecessors by offering furious four-player fun rooted in board game mechanics. The new additions in Mario Party 6 include day and night cycles, new characters and mini-games, and of course, the new microphone. Two of the new characters, named Brighton (a sun) and Twila (a crescent moon) get into a heated debate over who's better. The dispute creates a day/night dichotomy that comes into play whenever playing on any of the six game boards. When you're ready to play, a pop-up book springs open and highlights your options. Party Mode is where you'll find the different board games, which you can play solo or with friends. Instead of just collecting stars, though, each board features different objectives. Mario Party 6 features over 80 different mini-games.</desc>

    <name>Metal Arms - Glitch in the System</name>
    <desc>Set to the backdrop of a distant universe inhabited exclusively by robots, Glitch is on an adventure to save his home planet Iron Star from the evil General Corrosive and his various mechanical minions. You take control of the colorful machine ? think of him as a mini-mech ? who seems innocent enough but in actuality is armed to the teeth with various weapons and unique abilities. The setup results in an experience that approaches perpetual carnage, and it's all paced along and broken apart by some witty banter, too. But the real draw is the character's ability to sneak up behind robot foes equipped with open rear data panels and hack into and take control of them. Add to that split-screen multiplayer battles, and you've got total robot destruction, third-person-shooter-style.</desc>

The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo attacks. 

During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for his and gets to keep his abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the story there is also a Survival mode.</desc>

    <path>./NFL Street 2 (USA).nkit.gcz</path>
    <name>NFL Street 2</name>
    <desc>NFL Street 2 is the second game in EA's arcade football series. Players try to become the world's best urban footballer by conquering other teams using several gravity-defying tricks like up-the-wall passes, off-the-wall catches, and highlight-reel wall jukes.

Like the other games in the Street franchise, the game is played with a small amount of players and a focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike the first game, the walls can now be used for run-up passes and receptions, or bonuses by aiming for posters and hotspots.

There are twelve arenas to compete in (2 unlockable) and the players are licensed from the 2004 NFL rosters. Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament.

Another one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars. Characters created in this mode can be imported into the NFL Challenge, but also in Madden NFL 06.

The PSP version is a faithful port, with some of the cut scenes removed, and 3 new street modes added for Wi-Fi multiplayer: Street Slalom (an obstacle course), Style Point Challenge, and  Style Standoff, a end zone dance contest, similar to Space Channel 5, next to the regular multiplayer modes. Up to four players can play on a single PSP in the Party Play game modes such as the 2 Minute Challenge and Jump Ball Challenge.</desc>

    <name>NHL 06 </name>
    <desc>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features.

Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.

With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.

All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.

The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</desc>

Using it's partnership with the ESPN sports network, Sega has created NHL 2K3 using the same presentation method as ESPN.  Natural camera transitions, cut scenes, and overlay graphics are all used in cooperation with ESPN to give the game a more realistic feel.

All the standard game modes are here, from exhibition games and playoff games, to a very in depth Franchise mode that gives you complete control over your team.  You act as the general manager, coach, scout and player.  You can negotiate contracts, make trades, and draft rookies.

On the ice, you have a lot of control over your team as well.  You can anchor lines with key players, rotate your lines to always be matched up, and make sure you have the advantage every which way.

You can also play online via XBox System Link or XBox Live.  The latter allows you to connect to a player from anywhere, and engage in a game of hockey.  Using the headset, you can taunt or compliment your opponent, without any interruption to the game.

Rosters are from the 2002-2003 season.</desc>

    <path>./Odama (USA) (Rev 1).nkit.gcz</path>
    <name>Odama </name>
    <desc>Odama is a quirky pinball title set in ancient Japan.  You are in control of a giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the Ninten Bell to its destination.

The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its destination before sunset in each mission.

Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama are quite simple for today's standards.  In each mission, you, representing the Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan's powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed the founder of the Yamanouchi clan.  It is there you will exact revenge for his betrayal.  Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in Japanese, but there are English subtitles.

The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as well as killing them with your own soldiers.  It is important that they are killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time.  When all Odamas are lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission.  In addition, you learn commands for your soldiers as you progress through the game.  Using these commands, you'll be able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways.  For example, by saying, "press forward," your troops will use all of their strength to try and plow through enemy soldiers.  These commands are not only very useful, but in many cases, are vital to your success.

However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your Morale Bar.  When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission.

There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you.  Most notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army over to yours when it rolls them over.

In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups, and storyline throw it into a league of its own.</desc>

The Open Season video game allows players to relive the movie experience by playing as Boog and Elliot. Throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, use acorn-firing squirrels and pull outrageous woodland pranks to scare the pants off the hunters in this action-adventure romp through the forest.</desc>

The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.

Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.  The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.</desc>

    <desc>Pac-Man Fever takes place again!  This time, Pac-Man is throwing a party, and has invited his other Namco friends to join in the activities.  Players can choose for the six following characters:

Pac-Man (from Pac-Man), Ms. Pac-Man (from Ms. Pac-Man), Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken), Tiger Jackson (from Tekken), Astaroth (from Soul Calibur), and Reiko (from Ridge Racer).

Gameplay is similar to Nintendo's Mario Party, in which each player competes in a set of mini-games to advance around the board of three various worlds (Medieval, Space and Tropical).

Players set the length of the game (short, medium, long), and play in rounds.  Each round begins with a mini-game which determines how far a player can move on the board. Each tile on the board enables players to move forward or go backward, lose, gain, or steal tokens, play a single or two-player mini-game, spend earned tokens, or a raffle game to earn redemption tickets. 

With "Store" tiles, players can spend tokens to move forward, move other players backward, buy raffle tickets, or gamble for more tokens.

Once a player reaches the end of the board, players receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can be used to buy each mini-game separately for tournament play outside the game.  Once all the mini-games have been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their overall high score.</desc>

In this game one person plays as the famous Pac Man while the other players take the role of the ghosts desperately trying to stop the yellow menace from eating his way to a predetermined score. 

Now the twist is Pac Man sees the game from the classic Pac Man view on the Game Boy Advance while to ghosts each have a limited view of the area in 3D on the television screen. Teamwork becomes vital as they try to hunt down Pac Man, the ghost who eats Pac Man then gets the Game Boy Advance and tries his luck as the hunted.

If Four players are not available computers will act as any ghost not directly controlled by a player. Computer ghost can not hurt Pac Man unless they have been touched by a human controlled ghost. Which ever human player touches them first will get control of the game boy if the computer catches Pac Man.</desc>

Years later the band of ghosts, who continue to roam Pac-World, have stolen the fruits from the tree. Unknown to them, they have also unleashed the evil that lurked beneath the tree on a helpless Pac-World. Only one Pac can return the five golden fruits to the tree and stop both the ghosts and the new evil from destroying Pac-World, and that's Pac-Man.

Using his famous munching skills, Pac-Man must explore 20 monster, pit and trap filled levels. But of course, the Pac-Pills can be found across each map to aid Pac-Man in his quest.

The game also features four classic Pac-Man games to unlock, all taken from different Namco compilations. They are, in order of appearance:

    <desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

    <desc>In this world, there exist two kinds of stones which hold great powers: Shadow Stones, which hold powers of darkness, and Rave Stones, which hold powers of hope. 50 years ago, a great battle took place which destroyed a great portion of the planet and scattered the stones all over the globe. Now, a group of youngsters are searching for the Rave Stones, but of course, things are never as easy as they might seem...

Based on the manga and anime series created by Hiro Mashima, Rave Master is an action fighting game not unlike Power Stone or Poy Poy. Up to four players fight in an enclosed arena using various attacks and abilities. During battles, weapons will appear which can be picked up and used. Items called Rave Stones and Shadow Stones also appear, which will grant special abilities to the player who picks them up. Twelve characters from the anime and manga are available to play as.

There are several modes of play, including story mode, where you choose one of five characters and play through their story; VS mode, where up to four players fight with various kinds of rules; and free mode, where the goal is to survive through a series of stages.</desc>

    <desc>Long since the revolt from the mining of Mars, a new group has taken over Red Faction, and their sights are set on the dictator, Chancellor Sopot. Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.

As the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.

As was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.

Multiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.</desc>

    <desc>Special forces S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team's helicopter malfunctioned and crashed during their mission, disappearing into the Arklay Mountains. This and what happens to them is told in the story of Resident Evil Zero. Now, S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is sent on a mission to investigate a series of murders around Raccoon Forest. Spotting the Bravo team's helicopter, or what's left of it, they land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not knowing it was probably better to stay out.

You play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only one mission to be considered now: survival.

The game is largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation, with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.</desc>

    <name>Resident Evil 4 </name>
    <desc>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.

Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back" movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. 

The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.

The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</desc>

30 missions are on offer with various objectives (destroy other cars, kill citizens and build alliances with other clans), with your ultimate goal being the leader of the gang that everyone fears.
Weapons and upgrades keep your car ahead of the pack, but to do so you need to search out the parts. Scavenger hunts for blueprints is the only way to do so, building the ultimate weapons while improving the speed and reliability of your machine.</desc>

From dogs, cats, caged animals and more, your Sims share new friends to experience life's precious moments. With so many different animals to choose from, there's no telling what unpredictable experiences could occur. Create-A-Pet: Choose from dozens of dog and cat breeds or customize features for a one-of-a-kind pet. You can even modify your pet's body shape by choosing from specific colors and unique markings. Don't like the way they act? Change their personality - from smart and sweet to silly and sloppy - anyone can create their ideal animal friend in The Sims 2 Pets. Your Sims can encourage and discipline pets, training them to shake, roll over, play dead, and more. Unruly pets might dig in the yard, claw the sofa, or topple the trash. Thankfully, a little training can go a long way. Create and control digital characters over a lifetime, setting their goals in life from popularity and romance, to fortune and family- their stories are in your hands. Use special codes to share unlockable pet accessories, fur types or markings with other The Sims 2 Pets players. Take your Sims and their pet for a romp at any of the nearby park areas, or head to the Central Town Park which is a favorite of pet owners. While there, watch your pet play well with others while your Sim can meet others and socialize with fellow animal lovers. Visit the adjoining Town Center, a great gathering spot for Sims that evolves over time. Once you've seen the latest styles and decided on a purchase, deck your pet out in the latest clothing and accessories around. From geek to chic and cool to casual, your Sim can customize their pet's look with one stop in the Town Center.</desc>

    <desc>Enhanced port of the Dreamcast RPG, offering a mix of real-time exploration and turn-based battle sequences. Like the RPGs of old, Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, the basic idea is to send a player out into the world to slay groups of enemies, gain experience, buy weapons and items, and accomplish something grand. As lead character Vyse and his trusty female sidekick, Aika, you dock one of the evil Valuan's ships to take it over and grab some loot. As members of the Blue Rogues -- pirates that in Robin Hood fashion give to the poor and steal from the corrupted rich -- it's your whole life. In the process, you stumble into more than you bargained for. The actual gameplay itself revolves around several different devices: turn-based ground and air battles, airship-to-airship duels, and real-time 3D exploration.</desc>

    <desc>In Sonic Riders, Dr. Eggman challenges Sonic and his friends to a Worldwide Grand Prix, and the prize for coming out on top is an ultra-rare Chaos Emerald! Gliding on air boards – which are performance-oriented for each playable character – gamers will experience a heightened sense of sports-style racing tension as Sonic and his pals perform tricks and stunts over treacherous wide-open terrain.

Sonic and friends speed through tracks on air boards, using individual special moves to strike down opponents. Air is a big element of Sonic Riders. Your board's "fuel" source is air. You can fill up your air at various points on the course, but to race well you'll have to use another means of replenishment: performing tricks with your board. You'll also want to make use of turbulence from racers who are in front of you.</desc>

Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (a la Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City, and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers, to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.  

However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</desc>

Unlike the previous two entries in the series, you must venture around the mountain, completely free to do what you wish, in order to find challenges and races to compete in.

There are a variety of events to compete in, from your usual all-on-all race through courses, scattered with obstacles and huge jumps to perform wacky tricks, plus there's a half pipe to bust tricks, and there's plenty of challenging tricks to master, and items to grind to gain bonuses. Plus, you can ride the entire mountain whenever you like, either to practice moves or learn all the bumps and corners for the big races.

With challenges and races comes rewards, and along with trophies and medals to fill up your gallery you can also win cash prizes to purchase new items, improving your board or improving your image. The more you race the more experience your chosen character receives, leveling up your abilities and improving your technique, plus even more wild tricks to perform.</desc>

With a different front end interface to previous versions, which looks like a mix between MTV and a doodle book, you select the challenge you want to take part in rather than boarding your way to the event as previous versions.

With improved controls making "Monster Jumps" (Uber Tricks) easier to perform, everyone can look like a professional without learning button combos. As before, if you perform the same trick over and over, you won't get the points to take your skier/snowboarder from a novice to what they have a labeled "black-diamond-dominating rockstar".

The game promises big jumps, fast pace and lots of coloured, detailed slopes.

The GameCube version delivers Mario, Luigi and Peaches on the slopes as special characters. Each has their own moves and is accompanied by Mario-style music.</desc>

    <desc>SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play. 

Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</desc>

Unfortunately, none of the old crew is willing to hit the front lines with Fox this time around; Peppy has taken a role in mission support, Slippy has gotten into the world of research and development, while Falco has decided to launch a solo career. This means you'll have to go it alone as Fox, battling enemies, flying combative missions, making discoveries, and more. The story begins when McCloud finds a magical staff, compelling him to leave the land of Arwing to travel the world. Eventually, you'll meet up with a loopy new sidekick named Prince Tricky, learn how to ride on the backs of dinosaurs, fight enemies in hand-to-hand combat, and much more. A bold departure from earlier STAR FOX titles, Dinosaur Planet is a mixture of just about every gaming genre imaginable. Whether you're solving puzzles, mastering flight, getting into bare-knuckle brawls, or making allies, you'll have your hands full with this gargantuan title that's only available for the Nintendo Game Cube.</desc>

Armed with all the weapons and gadgets he can carry and a jetpack to boot, the character flies and shoots his way through a variety of gargantuan worlds and encounters recognizable creatures from the movies.</desc>

    <desc>The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear. The game's story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included. Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</desc>

    <name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</name>
    <desc>Based on the newer anime styled FOX cartoon of the same name, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles features Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello as green ninjas. Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza. Fighting against the public face of inventor Baxter Stockman and the more shadowy figure of Shredder and his Foot Clan, these Ninja Turtles will get the chance to make their opponents eat shell!

The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick.</desc>

    <desc>TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and control than any other console Turtles game to date. Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.</desc>

    <desc>Trigger Man is an action game where the main protagonist Trigger Man works for the Coladangelo Family, who is on the brink of a mafia-style war with the rival Montagano Family, which believes Don Coladangelo is responsible of the death of their Don's son. Shown from a third-person perspective players need to visit typical locations such as villas, restaurants and casinos to take down members of the opposing family.

Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total.

There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.</desc>

    <desc>When 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten by a genetically altered spider he became faster, stronger, more agile and gained the spider-like ability to cling to walls.  Add web shooters and a costume and Peter becomes Spider-Man.  Eddie Brock, Jr. is Peter’s childhood friend.  In search of his scientist father’s legacy, Eddie came in contact with a symbiotic suit which transformed him into the monstrous Venom.  Ultimate Spider-Man follows both their Brian Michael Bendis-scripted adventures, as Spidey attempts to prevent Venom from killing innocents while Venom seeks to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D.’s machinations.

The Ultimate version of the Spider-Man mythos revamps the franchise, bringing in edgier (and often younger) versions of famous superheroes and supervillains.  The Human Torch, Wolverine, Electro, and Green Goblin are some of the Ultimate characters who make appearances.  Ultimate Spider-Man features a fully rendered, cel-shaded Manhattan open to exploration.  

With few exceptions, Spider-Man and Venom can explore Manhattan and Queens, climbing, jumping, and web swinging away.  Story missions show up as hot spots on the map as do other in-game objectives.  When the player is done patrolling (or destroying) the city, they can hit these hot spots to advance the story.  Between story missions, Spider-Man and Venom can follow race paths, go on combat tours, discover and collect hidden icons, and help (or hurt) the citizens of New York.</desc>

With ferocity and ruthless efficiency, they descended upon the townfolk, enslaving them to work deep in the caves that surrounded their village. 

Dark Yabu murdered the grandfather of the young Vexx, who managed to slip quietly aboard the enemy's windship. There, locked deep within Yabu's sanctum, was the last pair of Astani Battle-gauntlets. The gauntlets leapt onto Vexx's outstretched hands and bonded to his arms giving him special powers.

The goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape.

Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</desc>

Fortunately, Worms Blast is not just a mere copycat of Puzzle Bobble with cell-shaded graphics. Team 17 have made numerous changes to the gameplay, which make playing the game quite a different experience.
Along others, these change include the ability to actually move your character or to shoot on the other player, different kinds of weapons and a load of varied gameplay modes. The main change to the game is probably the fact that you're no longer firing bubbles, but missiles that color them on impact.</desc>

You can also create your own wrestlers and put them in the story mode.  The graphics and the fighting system have been improved. Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan join the roster as Legends.

If all stamina is gone, the player won't be able to control the wrestler. In addition, players can perform up to four unique submission moves. The game is also very bloody, ranging from a small cut on the forehead, to a face full of blood and blood on the chest. Blood also drips onto the mat and stays there. A new type of match called The Last Man Standing is included in this game. This is similar to being knocked out but being counted out while stunned. The Create-A-Wrestler feature has returned for this game and is used for story mode.</desc>

    <name>XIII </name>
    <desc>XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance. The game is loosely based on the first five comics. The main theme of the game is based on Robert Ludlum's book 'The Bourne Identity' and features a man who is suffering from amnesia and quite possibly involved in the recent assassination of the President of the United States. You must be damn important, because everyone is trying to kill you. As you progress, you learn more about your secret agent past and your curious name, XIII.

You unravel clues behind a conspiracy of epic proportions in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions such as head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, XIII has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than 15 weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and a whole load of baddies in levels all over the world. During the game, you can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.</desc>

    <desc>ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points.

The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</desc>
