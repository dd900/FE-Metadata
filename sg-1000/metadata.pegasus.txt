	Bank Panic is an arcade shooting game developed by Sanritsu and manufactured by Sega in 1984. It was later ported by Sega to the SG-1000 and Sega Master System. An unlicensed clone called West Bank was released for several home computer systems. The same hardware would also be used for the later Sega/Sanritsu game Combat Hawk.
	The player takes on the role of a sheriff in 19th century USA, protecting a bank from armed robbers. There are twelve doors arranged in a circle, with the player in the centre, which can be viewed three at a time. Robbers who appear from the doors are to be shot (after they draw their weapons, for a higher score) and customers are to be ignored while they make a deposit. Once deposits have been made from all twelve doors, the level is complete.

PC-8801 and MSX versions had been released in 1984 and 1985, respectively, meaning this version is unusually late. The game was followed by The Black Onyx II: Search For The Fire Crystal, which saw its original MSX release in 1984.

The game has a fairly standard plot of rescuing a princess from a castle, though the game itself was considered very large for the time.

	The SG-1000 version of the game includes extra cutscenes and a training level not seen in the arcade version.
	Though Chack'n Pop was not a particularly successful game for Taito, it would go on to inspire the success of Bubble Bobble, which shares many of the same characters and devotes a stage to Chack'n Pop. Chack'n has also cameoed in numerous Taito games since, including Bubble Bobble, Fairyland Story, Parasol Stars, Puzzle Bobble (and sequels), Bubble Symphony, Bubble Memories and Arkanoid DS.
	Curiously this SG-1000 version uses the katakana script for writing Chack'n Pop as opposed to the hiragana script used in almost every other version.

As a puzzle-platformer, everything is affected by gravity, and if the egg falls from a great height, it will smash. Success is achieved by making your way down the playfield carefully.

The concept of racing in four different types of GP is scrapped, replaced instead with a GP that spans the world and three selectable difficulties.

	You play as a character who needs to absorb water to put out fires dotted around a maze. The fires also spawn fire-based enemies which can be defeated in a similar fashion. You can only store up to three shots at one time.
	Compared to other SG-1000 games, Guzzler shows some very poor production values. It thrusts you into gameplay without warning (which can result in cheap deaths) and it has a broken pause feature, which although appears to work, will unpause the game after a few seconds. There are only three maps and far fewer enemies than in the arcade version and it is also a much louder game, as the SG-1000 omits a high pitched squeak every time you make a step.

	Despite the name, the game is meant as a direct sequel to the Mark III version of Hang-On, and is virtually identical to that game. The only difference is downgraded graphics and the addition of music from the arcade version. Meanwhile, Super Hang-On is the direct sequel to the arcade game.
	It is compatible with the BH-400 bike handle controller, and would be the only SG-1000 game designed for it (though the peripheral is compatible with the Sega Master System and Sega Mega Drive).

In robot mode, you are able to destroy ground targets and have greater freedom across the screen at the expense of being a bigger target for enemies. You can shoot rapidfire, but move slower. In starship mode you cannot destroy ground targets, but are less likely to be destroyed thanks to the smaller surface area of the ship.

	Sega's version of Pitfall II was tweaked significantly from its western counterparts released for the Atari 2600, ColecoVision etc. The gameplay is largely the same, but there are many additions. These include a Lives system, mine-carts, balloons, and a final Demon boss. The SG-1000 version is directly inspired by the arcade game, and though cannot match the same level of graphical quality, it is arguably the nicest looking home port of the game.

Once you have defeated each enemy target, the mission is completed, and, upon completing some of them, your rank increases. Before defeating each target, however, you also need to destroy enemy jets, choppers, and submarines who will launch missiles or rockets at you. If you are hit by any of these, damage is inflicted to the submarine, but you can shoot down any of the missiles or rockets. You will need to keep an eye on the built-in radar and sonar to find out where enemies will hit next. Your fuel is limited, and can be increased by destroying certain enemies. The game ends when your submarine is destroyed or you run out of fuel.

description:
	Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over.
	Surprisingly the SG-1000 port of the game was one of the most accurate of its time, surpassing the NES and MSX versions which were the console's main competitors. Though it adds more color (the arcade version was simply black and white, with translucent overlays to mimic color), the SG-1000 version retains all the original graphics, whereas other ports (especially for Atari systems) re-drew the invaders due to various graphical restrictions.
	The SG-1000 version does not appear to have been released outside of Japan.

The player controls a shuttle and must navigate it through a course defined by coloured stars, similar to ski slaloms. The player must also avoid obstacles, and will be awarded with extra points depending on on his/her speed across the course.

	The player takes control of a motorcyclist who's in a race to be the first to traverse the United States from the west to the east coast, starting in Los Angeles and ending up in New York City.
	Gameplay consists of the player dodging cars and other roadway hazards on their way to the next checkpoint. Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.
	The SG-1000 version of the game is one of two SG-1000 releases to see four separate Japanese releases (the other being Monaco GP) - three on cartridge with each of the SG-1000's box designs, and one on Sega Card. Despite this it did not see a release outside of Japan.

	Zoom 909 is an arcade game developed by Sega for VCO Object arcade hardware. It was released worldwide in 1982, however after obtaining a license for Buck Rogers, western versions of the game became known as Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Both Zoom 909 and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom are largely the same game minus some minor graphical differences.
	Though most home ports of the game are based on Planet of Zoom, Zoom 909 was brought to the Japanese MSX in 1983 and SG-1000 in 1985. These versions take more liberties with the formula, introducing a top-down stage as level 3.
