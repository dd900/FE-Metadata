    <name>Asterix - Sur la Trace D'Idefix  </name>
    <desc>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.

This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the "Instant Fun" option. They vary from a "Memory" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as "Throw a Roman Mini Game".

Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!). </desc>

    <desc>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.

To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</desc>

    <name>Asteroids  </name>
    <desc>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.

You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

    <name>Babe and Friends  </name>
    <desc>Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a "sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents do.  In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.

Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel.  While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, "that'll do, pig."</desc>

    <desc>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.

Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.</desc>

    <desc>Balloon Fight GB is a color remake of Balloon Kid. 
 
All features from Balloon Kid are still intact. The main new addition is that there is color. There is now also a world map, and the title screen and menu systems are slightly different. Through the world map, levels are given names, which were previously unknown since Balloon Kid did not give any names to areas or levels. 
 
Balloon Fight GB is notoriously rare, and it was distributed via the Nintendo Power Flash cartridge, which is no longer supported by Nintendo. As such, copies of this game downloaded onto one of these cartridges can get high prices and rarely is ever sold. Due to the nature of this cartridge, the game would have had to been downloaded onto the cartridge before the service was discontinued. 
 
This game is available today on the 3DS eShop as a Game Boy Color Virtual Console game. However, the game is only available through the Japan eShop, so 3DS owners in Europe and America cannot download the software. 
 
After the Nintendo Power cartridge writing service was shut down, it was possible to order prewritten Nintendo Power cartridges with Balloon Fight GB over the phone, and these versions came with a fold-out manual and a large button with the game's box art, among other things.</desc>

    <desc>Based off the movie, Batman Beyond puts the player on the streets of Gotham (Beyond) to take out the ever-grinning Joker, but before that an obvious long line of his evil minions - some of which are genetically engineered.

Scroll around, punch, kick, play with bat-weapons, and avoid being on the receiving end of those attacks. There are multiple 'bat suits' that you can choose from, each with their own special abilities and purposes.

Mostly a 3-D beat-the-living-sunshine-out-of-whatever-moves type.</desc>

    <desc>Now it's your turn to sink your opponent's battleship in this Game Boy Color rendition of the classic strategic board game. Players deploy all four of their ships to different areas on a grid, and take turns firing shots at various parts of their opponent's grid. Hit each ship the required number of times, and the ship is removed from play. In a unique twist on the classic game, each ship has new weapons. For the solo player, there are 48 missions to complete with animated full-color cutscenes to inspire you to victory! The real challenge however, is taking on a human opponent via a link cable. Forget setting up the board and looking for missing pieces, this is the real way to play Battleship!</desc>

She'll ask Billy Bob to fetch her rabbits or bass, and it's up to you to help Billy Bob get them. Obviously, to get the things she wants you'll have to either go hunting or fishing. Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You'll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing. Once you've finally cleared them and gotten the items you need, you'll head out to catch your real prize.

    <desc>Game Boy Color version of Boarder Zone is substantially different from its PC namesake.

This version features a pseudo-3D environment, where the camera is positioned behind the boarder and the piste scrolls towards the camera. Obstacles appear on the horizon and increase in size as they near the viewpoint.

The two main game modes are 'Competition' and 'Challenge'.

Competition features a 'race attack' mode (basically a speed race with another AI player), Trick Attack (trick points based over 5 courses, beating a course threshold to advance), Time Attack (best time), and Supreme Attack (race with tricks).

Challenge modes is about beating any previous records set for a particular track and supported Time Attack (best time), Trick Attack (best trick points), Slalom Attack (time on a flag course), and Vs Race (which uses the Game Boy Universal Link Cable).

There is also a practice mode and a 'ghost boarder' - basically a replay of the player's best race.

Trick moves include Mute Grab, Nose Grab, Tweak, Stiffy, Indy Air, Tail Grab, Stalefish, Shifty Air, Meloncholy, Frontside Air, Backside Air, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, Front Flip, Back Flip, Rodeo Flip, and McTwist; most of which are performed with combo style control moves.

The player can choose from four characters: Sandy, Travis, Alain, and Tara.</desc>

    <desc>A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flikâ€™s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</desc>

    <desc>The 4th edition of Bust-A-Move adds some great new characters to choose from, as well as a Story mode, where you win Tarrot cards from each puzzle you complete. Player VS. CPU has two different modes: Story mode sees a story unfold as you defeat each CPU character (and changes depending on the character you start with) and Win Contest is a simple "how many games can I win in a row" against the computer. Finally, if you complete the Challenge mode (where you must complete certain puzzels as fast as possible, and get judged on technique, speed etc.) the Edit mode will become available. In here you can put together your own puzzles for you or your friends to complete.</desc>

    <name>Cannon Fodder  </name>
    <desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, CATZ lets you adopt a cat from one of three breeds: Siamese, Calico, or Persian. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

    <desc>October 1st, 1997 is known as END DAY. A great war encircles the globe and brings about an end to civilization. The surviving humans concluded that they could never repeat their mistakes and build a great tower in the sky to watch over the world and act accordingly to combat "evil". One hundred years have passed since then and a hidden cryogenic chamber in the mountains springs to life...

    <name>Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX </name>
    <desc>Acclaim's foray into trick-based BMX games spawned a unique version for the Game Boy Color.

The basic design is the same as in the original console title and other post-Tony Hawk extreme sports games. In career mode, the player has to complete various goals in each level to advance and unlock further levels. These goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items. The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels.

In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode.

The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.</desc>

You play as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the experience for would-be hunters.</desc>

Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds: Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

    <desc>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</desc>

    <desc>One of the great traditions in mythology is the story of the lone adventurer conquering evil in teh face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

Dragon Warrior II 
The second quest takes place many years after the defeat of the Dragonlord.

    <name>Driver - You are the Wheelman  </name>
    <desc>In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. 

Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. 

Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.

Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.</desc>

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

Of course, the game's main objective is to collect the parts necessary to construct an interplanetary communicator that E.T. can use to "phone home." All the while, Earth-based authorities will try to apprehend you, so make sure you bring your wits and reflexes to the table. There are 45 quests in all, each of which presents new traps and obstacles to avoid, and the game even has three separate difficulty levels to master. With six main game areas and 10 detailed environments, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL: Escape from Planet Earth has unusually high replay value, wonderful graphics, and more gameplay than you can shake a stick at.</desc>

When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown.

    <desc>The Game Boy Color version of Stars 2001 is very loosely based on the PC/Playstation game with the same name. Much of what made the original special is gone. For example, the whole concept of Star Points, which was such an important part of the console game has been removed. Left is a football game with a quite ordinary style. Due to the Premier League license all twenty teams are real and have real world players (16 in each team). The gameplay resembles the style of many classic games in the genre and is viewed from an top down perspective. Play modes available are friendly match, full season or a custom league of the players' choice.</desc>

    <desc>Supersonic jet dogfighting comes to the small screen in F-18 THUNDERSTRIKE for the Game Boy Color. In this one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who's flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don't think that it's all fun and games. When the mission's complete, you'll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.</desc>

    <name>Flintstones, The - Burgertime in Bedrock </name>
    <desc>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

    <desc>Flipper &amp; Lopaka is a licensed side-scroller based on the Australian cartoon of the same name. The premise of the show is that Flipper the dolphin has taught Lopaka (a native Pacific islander boy) the secrets of the ocean, allowing him to survive underwater for long periods and communicate with sea life. Together the two must usually stop the evil plans of Dexter, a mean octopus. 
 
The game has you trade off between the two characters: Lopaka must find a magic crystal in his sprawling platforming levels, then Flipper must take the crystal and place it on an altar in his Ecco the Dolphin-style levels. Flipper also handles the boss fights, and the bonus levels that are accessed by collecting 100 pearls.</desc>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points.

In this game, the player takes control of the big guy himself as giant monsters from space have invaded Earth and are determined to destroy it. Unfortunately for both the aliens and Godzilla the military is out to destroy both, so Godzilla now has to fight off the military to throw back the alien menace.

There are seven levels in all. The player will travel through each level destroying the military to reach the end of the level and fight the boss monster. The only control the player has over Godzilla is his attacks as Godzilla will walk on his own from left to right on the screen in a linear path. There are four attacks to choose from: Stomp, Bite, Tail-Whip and the famous Radiation Breath.</desc>

    <name>Gold and Glory - The Road to El Dorado </name>
    <desc>The GameBoy Color version of Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado is a side-scrolling platformer that follows the main events of the animated movie.

Through many levels you control one of two main characters: Tulio or Miguel. They can walk, run, jump, climb, collect objects, and use cutlasses. In most levels you should proceed from one part of level to another collecting a certain number of items, sometimes significant ones such as parts of a map showing the way to El Dorado. Different opponents will try to prevent your progress, but they can be either avoided or eliminated.

Different arcade sequences such as running away from a bull or riding a horse as well as several battles with bosses are present. Such encounters include fights with a cougar, Cortez himself, and also playing Indian basketball against the Indian champion.</desc>

    <path>./Grand Theft Auto (USA) (GB Compatible).zip</path>
    <name>Grand Theft Auto  </name>
    <desc>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.

The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the 
big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.

Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.

The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</desc>

    <desc>As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of the son of a brilliant scientist who has discovered a means to travel through time. Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian's first mission is to use his father's discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner.

You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.</desc>

    <name>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  </name>
    <desc>The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics.

To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which increases defense, for example).

Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.

Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu. </desc>

    <desc>In the first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy Color, the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is told in the form of a traditional role-playing game.

Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, battling monsters and gaining experience and levels.

Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use a variety of spells against various critters and other enemies. In addition, card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards can be used to produce powerful magical effects. These cards can be found all over the freely explorable Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry himself, but only with the right ingredients.

As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the House Cup in the end.

The game features several mini-games that, once found in the main game, can also be accessed from the main menu.</desc>

The farm, situated on an island, needs plenty of work, so you need all your skills to get things working correctly.

Your many tasks range from tending to the farm animals, keeping an eye on the budget while purchasing goods (food, water, mechanical items, etc) at the local stores, and so forth. And although the main aim is to build and maintain the farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take care of yourself (go to the movies, buy pets, find a girlfriend/boyfriend).</desc>

    <desc>Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. 

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</desc>

    <name>Hexcite - The Shapes of Victory   </name>
    <desc>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.

Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)

In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</desc>

The plot involves Communists attempting to rebuild an ancient time machine, whose pieces are spread across 19 levels. 

There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them. Indy is variously armed with a pistol, machine gun, grenades and his ubiquitous whip. Each level has a password, and ends with a clip advancing the story. As well as Soviets, your foes include scorpions, snakes and jellyfish.</desc>

    <name>Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 </name>
    <desc>This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of tracks in different scenarios.

Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four races. The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.
The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.

While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</desc>

To do this, you have a catapult at your disposal, the objects you need to use to balance the scale are given to you by conveyor belt. One on the left and one on the right. But these objects differ in weight, so you must carefully choose the scales bucket you're going to put the objects in. To make things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen to make it just a little bit more challenging. Like crocodiles that eat object or jokers that throw around playing cards offsetting your carefully balance scale. The game stages 5 different game worlds each divided into 16 levels.</desc>

The goal is to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks. One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse inward, creating more room to maneuver. If you miss a piece, it will stick to the sides of the play area and cannot be removed. The game ends when the cluster of pieces becomes so big that it cannot fit into the screen. With 16 skill levels, the degree of challenge is always appropriate. If friends want to join the action, they can via a link cable. See how long you can last in KLUSTAR.</desc>

    <desc>To coincide with the release of another Little Mermaid video, Disney has also released another Little Mermaid videogame. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.</desc>

    <desc>LOGICAL adds a distinctive puzzle game experience to the Game Boy Color. Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

    <name>Looney Tunes - Carrot Crazy   </name>
    <desc>Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. After finding out all carrots have been stolen from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who stole the carrots.

Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are five different worlds which represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film clapboards present.

Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time.

Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while.

If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets.

Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</desc>

In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.

Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.

Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.

Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</desc>

    <desc>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

    <desc>Maya the Bee &amp; Her Friends is the first game based on Maya the Bee, a world famous German book, comic, and animated cartoon series. This licensed title is based on the animated cartoon series.

In the game evil spiders have kidnapped insects and asking for honey as ransom. It is up to Maya and her friends to thwart their evil schemes.

The game has the player control three insects one at a time, but together on the same screen, Maya the bee, Willy the bee and Flip the grasshopper. Each insect has its own abilities. Maya can pull levers and Flip allows the others to leap to higher places. In each of the 120 levels an insect has to be saved and the three have to combine their skills to puzzle their way through the spider's web, in a similar vein as The Lost Vikings.

The game was released in Europe only and is identical to The New Adventures of Mary Kate and Ashley, but with a different license. The same engine was later also re-used in Mary-Kate and Ashley Get a Clue.</desc>

    <name>Metal Gear Solid </name>
    <desc>Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the same game as the popular Playstation/PC installment of the series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake. A secret government project, codenamed "Babel", attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype.

The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.</desc>

    <name>Metal Walker  </name>
    <desc>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered.  This "core" element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island.  One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.

The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.

The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.

There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.

As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.</desc>

    <name>Mickey's Racing Adventure  </name>
    <desc>Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting prepared for a big carnival!  Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.

Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.

The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.

The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.

Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</desc>

    <desc>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog!  All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!

Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.

The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).

There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.

Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.</desc>

    <desc>Tiny cars race through the house in MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo. Take 15 vehicles including jeeps, helicopters, tanks, speedboats, and sports cars onto 60 different tracks like the breakfast table, the garden, and the pool table. Each track has its own obstacles and hazards, so keep your eyes peeled. For example, watch out for the rubber ducks, soapsuds, and whirlpool drain in the bathtub. The biggest hazard is falling off of the track, which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one Game Boy: one player uses direction pad and the other uses the buttons to steer his vehicle left or right, the goal being to push the opposition off of the track. With all of the track and vehicle choices, there is plenty to keep you playing MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo.</desc>

    <desc>Micro Maniacs Racing is a racing game in the Micro Machines series. This time however, you don't get to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but others allow you to take small vehicles such as jet skis and skate boards.

The game offers a variety of micro men to play with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad professors, experiments gone wrong, and other strange characters. They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.

The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.</desc>

    <desc>The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</desc>

After successfully defending a city from two waves of missiles, you will be treated to a special animation that is related to the city.

    <name>Monkey Puncher   </name>
    <desc>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. 

Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.

In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. 

During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</desc>

Sulley can push objects around, climbing on top to reach higher places as well as break through barriers by dashing into them, or hang onto ledges. Mike can double jump and crawl into tight spaces. Both also have different attacks - Mike can throw cans of Blort cola and Sulley can throw toys. 
 
Powerups to be collected are Blort cans, which in addition to being Mike's ammunition function as health - being damaged only means losing a few cans. There are also boxes of Chinese takeout food (collect 10 for an extra life) and teddy bears (instant one up).</desc>

    <desc>All of the action and fun of the first feminist arcade game can be put in the palm of your hand with MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition. You take control of the yellow disk adorned with lipstick and a pink bow, better known as the lovely Ms. Pac-Man. The goal is to guide her around the maze and eat all of the dots, avoiding the four ghosts that chase you. There are power pellets located in each corner of the maze which, when eaten, turn the ghosts blue. Once this happens, the ghosts can be eaten. Occasionally, fruit will float into the maze, which can be munched for extra points. If your friends want to play along, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. As an additional bonus, a complete version of SUPER PAC-MAN is included on the cartridge. Play as the first female arcade hero in MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition.</desc>

    <name>Mummy Returns, The </name>
    <desc>Based on the 2001 movie starring Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, this version differs greatly from it's console version.  The main bulk of the game is side-scroller with stages where the player moves from right to left trying to escape a wall of water while avoiding enemies and pitfalls and even a scene recreating the valley escape in the blimp, but with the same elements.  There are also one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles Lethal Enforcers.

There are three different characters to choose from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick &amp; Evelyn's water escape stage feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).

There are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.</desc>

    <desc>Nicktoons Racing for the Game Boy Color is conceptually similar to its console counterpart. It's a kart racing game but on the handheld it is viewed from a top down perspective. Some of the most famous Nickelodeon characters are competing on the race track and the player can choose to play as any of them. 

Two game modes exist: quick race and championship. In the quick race mode players can choose to play any track of the four available program environments. In the championship the player has to complete each track in a specific order. 

The game allows the player to race as the following seven Nickelodeon characters:

1. Tommy
2. Eliza
3. CatDog
4. Arnold
5. SpongeBob SquarePants
6. Dagget
7. Norbert

Tracks are divided into four different program environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. There's numerous power ups that the player can pick up. For example: Checkered Flag will increase the car's top speed, wrapped package gives the player a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for a short time and the milk bottle causes the opponents to lose traction.</desc>

    <desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board. 
 
Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. 
 
Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

    <name>Pitfall - Beyond the Jungle  </name>
    <desc>An evil force known as Scourge is manipulating the Red Lucense in order to take over the jungle. Now it is up to Pitfall Harry Jr. to use the Blue Lucense to restore peace to the land. You control Harry as he battles through 15 levels that span jungles, volcanoes, prisons, and caverns. Each world has unique variations; for example, you have to swing from vines in the jungle stages, while using a pickaxe to battle scorpions and other monsters. For some additional help, Harry has quick reflexes to allow him to dodge bullets and jump over some of the bad guys. In addition to Harry's innate skills, there are power-ups scattered throughout the levels including extra lives, gold bars, crystals, and extra health. Help Harry restore peace to the jungle in PITFALL: Beyond the Jungle.</desc>

    <name>Planet of the Apes  </name>
    <desc>Released in conjunction with the 2001 cinematic remake, PLANET OF THE APES, the game actually takes its plot from the 1968 original film. Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he's considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It's not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that's really its charm.</desc>

    <name>Pocket Bomberman   </name>
    <desc>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.

This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</desc>

    <desc>Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo's release of Pokémon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999's Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases. 
 
Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.</desc>

    <name>Pokemon Card GB 2 - GR Dan Sanjou!  </name>
    <desc>Pokémon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanjo!, released March 28, 2001, is the Japanese-exclusive sequel to the original Pokémon Trading Card Game, also for the Game Boy Color. Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo, and was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.  
 
Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed "likely" by website IGN in 2001, the game has not been made available outside Japan. Pokémon Card GB2 earned a 29 out of 40 score from Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine.</desc>

Many of the items that you collect throughout the adventure can be traded for others via friends playing the other POWERPUFF GIRLS games on their systems. Although it's a one-player game, the trading aspect gives the experience a significantly interactive element. Of course, the brilliant sense of humor from the cartoon series is present throughout the adventure, as are all of the other characters you've come to love. Handheld video games just don't get much more creative (or fun) than this.</desc>

    <name>Prince of Persia   </name>
    <desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

You'd better be in top form as you command a killer spacecraft out into orbit in hopes of rescuing humanity from unthinkable misery. Each of the eight stages in PROJECT S-11 poses unique challenges, and each setting is more harrowing than the last. Although you're going it alone in this one, there are four different types of power-ups hidden throughout the game to give the boost you'll need to survive and wipe out the terrifying extra-terrestrials. You'll benefit from a complete statistical readout that adorns the right side of your screen, keeping you abreast of all necessary information: your score, your ship's armor level, and the number of bombs you have stored up for combat. The game's fast-paced action looks excellent in full color, and the intensity of it will have you breaking a sweat before you're through the first level. Those aliens had better look out with you at the controls, Earth stands a fighting chance.</desc>

    <name>Puchi Carat   </name>
    <desc>A mix between classic "Walls" and "Bubbles" puzzles games 
12 characters to challenge 
12 gems to win 
Intense competitions 
4 amazing game modes 
 
The general objective of Puchi Carat is to destroy gem-like blocks using a ball and paddle. Gems "fall in" from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy. 
 
The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over. 
 
The arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.</desc>

    <name>Rampage - World Tour  </name>
    <desc>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage.  Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste.  George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.

The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.

The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor.  Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.  Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</desc>

The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</desc>

    <desc>When a villain known only as Mr. Dark appears, trouble brews in Rayman's world.  Mr. Dark captures the Toons - source of light and Rayman's friends.  With no more light, evil creatures begin to roam, making the world unsafe for everyone.  Its up to you, as Rayman, to free your friends and put an end to Mr. Dark's dastardly schemes!

Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs.  Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time.  He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch.  He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes.

The Game Boy Color version of Rayman remains true to the spirit of the original game, but makes some notable changes, particularly when compared to the original's bright, vibrant graphics.  Some levels have also been modified or simplified from the original release.</desc>

There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid's games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone's skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed. Now you can help a young gamer get started with RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy.</desc>

    <desc>Following the success of the original PlayStation edition of Resident Evil in 1996, Capcom expanded the game in a number of ports - one of those planned was for the GameBoy Color. In 1999, HotGen Studios, Ltd., a company in the United Kingdom, was selected by Capcom to port the game. 
 
HotGen designed the game to be a direct-conversion of the PlayStation version following the same single-player paths as other versions with options to play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. New additions were also planned including a greater variety in enemies and the ability to disarm traps. A new save feature was also in development, removing the need for Ink Ribbons and finding save points. 
 
However, after sending the finished product to Capcom for evaluation, the company turned it away. Their official statement in 2000 claimed that they were "not confident that the product would have made both consumers and Capcom happy."</desc>

One S.T.A.R.S. member, Leon S Kennedy (from Resident Evil 2) was sent out to destroy the weapon, but the team have been unable to contact him since he arrived at the ship.

Using a combination of top down side-scrolling action and 1st person shooter, it is your job to get aboard the liner, currently floating in the Atlantic Ocean, destroy the weapon and find Leon. Along the way, you'll come across plenty of deadly  undead enemies, similar to those found in the original Resident Evil series, while using a range of weapons and items found in the ship.</desc>

    <name>Road Rash </name>
    <desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

The platform levels have various themes such as clouds, rocket ship, a gooey world, a haunted mine, a volcano, a pyramid, a pagoda and the Notre Dame. The goal of the game is to eventually find Chuckie a princess to become his new mother.</desc>

    <desc>What do you say? Itâ€™s Scrabble, right? True, but not as we know it. Ubi Soft has finally reproduced one of the worldâ€™s most popular board games for the handheld gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color.  
 
Visually, thereâ€™s really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The game consists of a series of white tiles each with their own letter and value. Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random letters, make a word out of 'em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional.  
 
Seven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest scoring word possible. Clearly, letters such as Q, X and Z have a greater value, but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited. Once youâ€™ve chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or vertical fashion. Certain spaces on the board contain score boosters that will increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is particularly useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the process once your opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the highest scoring player wins.  
 
So there you have it. Itâ€™s Scrabble on a handheld, and itâ€™s brilliant.</desc>

    <name>Space Invaders  </name>
    <desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.

Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn't include the Vs. mode.</desc>

    <desc>Space Station Silicon Valley is a based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It keeps story, gameplay mechanics and even the basic level design while translating everything into a platforming perspective shown from the side.  
 
The story is about a space station which is populated by independent robot animals. A while ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth. 
 
The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.</desc>

Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements.  It contains both horizontal and vertical sections.  You must make your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses.  Mostly, you'll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

There are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, enemies can take more damage.  One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.</desc>

The game is a platformer, divided into several large levels. Progression is not strictly linear: some of the levels can be freely explored in any order before continuing with the story. Locations include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and punches. Defeating them will eventually result in him gaining levels, becoming stronger and learning some new fighting moves.

Spidey's special abilities come into play when he swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls or throws web balls at enemies to immobilize them. His spider-sense will usually alert him when important locations or special obstacles are near.

The game includes various boss fights with the likes of Venom, the Lizard and the Hobgoblin.</desc>

    <name>Spy vs Spy </name>
    <desc>The Black Spy and the White Spy have feuded on the pages of MAD magazine for decades. Now they bring their feud to the Game Boy Color. You can play as either the Black Spy or the White Spy, with the goal being to outsmart your opponent and collect five objects hidden throughout the level. As luck would have it, you have an infinite number of booby traps to place throughout the level to get rid of your nemesis. Buckets of water can be set up over doors and items can be rigged with bombs. If your opponent has set a booby trap, you can defuse it with the proper item. Should you get caught in a trap, you have infinite lives, and all you lose is time. If you want a friend to join the mayhem, use a link cable and go at it. Who will be able to survive from one stage to the next in SPY VS SPY?</desc>

    <name>Star Ocean - Blue Sphere    </name>
    <desc>Star Ocean: Blue Sphere is another installment in the Star Ocean series and it is a direct sequel to Star Ocean: The Second Story.

The game starts with the crash land of Opera's starship on the Planet Edifice. Opera wakes up, gathers all crew-mates and decides to send S.O.S. to their friends on Earth. While the help is coming, the first events begin.

First of all, you should assign 3 crew-mates to the team in order to explore the planet. After you move out to the ground you may switch between team members, walk around the planet, go inside locations, interact with items, talk with friendly persons, and begin battle with hostile creatures. Each member has a certain number of skills, which may be used and developed in RPG style, and some unique abilities. The monsters are seen by your team and battles may be avoided.

The battle flows in side-scrolling real-time mode, when you control main selected character in the team, while others act based on their own AI.

The game is made in Japanese and is single-player only.</desc>

    <desc>It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

    <name>Stuart Little - The Journey Home </name>
    <desc>This little mouse has one big journey ahead of him, and you're just the one to help him out. Unfortunately, the Little family didn't foresee the possible conflict of interest in keeping a cat and mouse on the same household when they adopted Stuart, and that's proving to be a bit of a problem. Between newfound enemies and domestic obstacles, the tiny mouse is having one heck of a time! There are eight gigantic levels to conquer in The Journey Home, and each one is based on a scene from the box office smash STUART LITTLE movies (which are, of course, based on the book by E.B. White). You'll end up tackling a mini-golf course, Central Park, a model boat race, a bunch of toy cowboys, and more in this epic quest for peace. In addition, here are plenty of platforms and hazards to run, jump, and flip through, and three difficulty settings ensure that younger gamers and experienced veterans alike will find the game appealing. 
 
In Stuart Little: The Journey Home, kids play as Stuart Little, the clever, ever-cheerful mouse from the popular Stuart Little movie and classic children's book of the same name. In the game, Stuart's just joined the Little family, and there's plenty of action to master, such as sliding down the laundry chute as a shortcut or using the flip-top bin to get more altitude. The Littles also join you in your play, as does Snowbell, the family cat who just can't warm up to even the most lovable of mice. 
 
This side-scrolling game abounds with action that uses many of the movie's favorite locations. The Journey Home's eight levels of gameplay take Stuart through the thrilling model boat race, a topsy-turvy miniature golf course, a toy cowboy town, and New York's Central Park. 
 
Every level is filled with power-ups and items that let you boost your energy and gain points. Three play settings make this a game that kids with varying skill levels can enjoy.</desc>

    <desc>When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.

Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening.  Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.

The game also features a unique "merge" system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items.  For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</desc>

Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon's characteristic genre name is Dungeon RPG (ãƒ€ãƒ³ã‚¸ãƒ§ãƒ³RPG Danjon RPG?). It is the first sequel in the Tales series, which normally does not have connected storylines. The story begins 205 years after the beginning of Tales of Phantasia. 
 
Due to the limits of the Game Boy, the game uses a battle system called Petit LMBS, a turn-based variation on the Linear Motion Battle System used by the rest of the series. As in normal LMBS, the player controls only one character and does so via button combinations instead of a dialogue choice, while party members are computer-controlled. A remake of the game was later released on PlayStation Portable called Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X.</desc>

    <desc>TAZ MUNCHING MADNESS features Taz in his first adventure on Game Boy Color. Playing the game gives the player the same feel as watching the cartoon show with Taz's signature twist and amusing moments. Presented in a 2D look, the graphics, and scenes on every level have a colorfully appealing view from the top down over the game play. Taz must embark on a mission to save his friend, Wendal T. Wolf from Bull Gator and his crony, Axl. Taz ventures away from his home in Tasmania and must pass through the Amazon Jungle, Amsterdam, Switzerland, the Greek Islands, China, Australia, and more. Those familiar with Taz's character on the Looney Tunes cartoons will recognize the fact that Taz hasn't lost his taste for strange and unusual objects as his food source and continues with that practice in his game. Taz literally has to eat his way through each level in order to advance to the next level. Food has significant importance how victorious Taz will be in his mission and even becomes functional at some points. The more food Taz consumes, the faster he will advance and the closer he will get to rescuing his friend. The road to the rescue will be littered with obstacles and challenges from Taz's enemies. Fans of the Looney Tunes cartoons will want to own this game as well as anyone who enjoys colorful, fast-paced and challenging game play.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the Tiny Toon Adventures Cartoon, the player plays Buster, who needs to survive 11 partially scrolling platform levels, in order to free his friends Babs, Pluck and Hampton from the clutches of Montana Max.

Each level is populated by several enemies out of a total of 23 different enemy types. They can be defeated with different types of balls that Buster has at his disposal (football, soccer and baseball), that vary in their behaviour. The Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time. Soccerball and Football 'kill' with direct hits.

Progress is tracked via a password feature and the story is told via cut scenes.</desc>

Extras can be used to distract, punch, flatten or otherwise execute the opponent, essentially delaying him.

Progress is tracked via a password

    <name>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six  </name>
    <desc>The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.

The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.

The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.</desc>

    <desc>Tonic Trouble for the Game Boy Color is a side-scrolling platform game featuring the alien janitor Ed as the protagonist, who spilled a toxic drink on Earth. This is causing all kinds of things to mutate, so agent XYZ is ordering Ed to go clean things up. Meanwhile badguy Grock is taking advantage of the Tonic.

While the story is the same as for the Windows and Nintendo 64 version, the gameplay and levels are quite different. The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D and plays like a classic 2D platform game. Ed can walk and jump and has to avoid obstacles such as pits, falling platforms, poison spitting holes, and mutated enemies.</desc>

The story is very loosely based on the movie of the same name. The player guides the well known pilot Maverick through a series of realistic training missions to receive graduation from the Top Gun school. The story is advanced in several stills throughout the game.

The player will fly a F-14 Tomcat on an isometric map. He has to complete several objectives in each mission. To achieve those he has four different weapons at his disposal (machine gun, bombs, rockets and missiles). The gameplay is somewhat similar to the Strike series.</desc>

    <desc>On their way to help in the battle against Sargon, a crew of adventurers each skilled in their own way encounter a storm that rips a hole in their ship. Safely reaching Lamini, or Land of Towers, the friendly people of the land help repair the damaged ship. As the crew members are looking for a job, they meet the Mayor of the town who is in need of messengers. He tells the adventurers that Lord Baniff has not been heard from in weeks, and that he needs them to seek him out in his Tower and bring word of his condition. Entering the doorway into the Tower, the entrance collapses behind them and they must find their way out.

The gameplay is similar to other first-person realtime D&amp;D games like the Eye of the Beholder series, though not as complex. There are four characters in the game and you choose one to control. Spell incantations are learned from scrolls and are cast by combining the correct syllables. There are 15 levels to explore and tons of monsters and items to find. You can play the game in cooperative mode with another player using a link cable.</desc>

    <desc>If you're ready for explosive, mind-twisting puzzle-action mayhem then grab a copy of TROUBALLS from Capcom. In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn't get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you'll love TROUBALLS to pieces.</desc>

If you enjoyed the multiplayer modes in Turok 2, then this is for you.

Instead of the usual Turok single player missions, you must control your character and complete certain missions (from getting the most frags in a time limit, finding an item, or lasting the distance). Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives.

Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player missions) time trials and frag fests. </desc>

    <desc>Tyrannosaurus Tex é um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa inédito para o console portátil Nintendo Game Boy Color. O jogo gerou grandes expectativas. 
Um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa no Game Boy Color parece ser um desafio para os padrões de qualquer um, então não é de surpreender que o Tyrannosaurus Tex tenha sido criado por alguém com vontade de fazer o que ninguém havia feito antes. Tendo deixado Psygnosis depois de trabalhar em títulos como a série Colony Wars, Ben John fundou a Slitherine Software, baseada no Reino Unido, e começou a flexionar seus músculos de codificação. Depois de considerar um jogo RTS no estilo Command &amp; Conquer, ele estabeleceu um FPS e começou a trabalhar em uma demonstração de tecnologia no início de 1999. Contando com a ajuda de seu amigo Dan Crawley (conceito / personagem) e pai Mike John (designer), o A demonstração foi exibida na Feira Européia de Computação de 1999 e atraiu a atenção de editores como Codemasters, Take2 e THQ. O jogo acabou sendo assinado pela Eidos, que adicionou o produtor Iain McNeil ao time. A produção completa começou em setembro de 1999 com uma data planejada de lançamento em abril de 2000.</desc>

Before he can say "I hate Mario", the box pulls him inside and into a room with a dark figure, who strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing Music boxes and he can leave. And any treasure he finds he can keep. 

Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can't die from any attacks by the enemy. However he can change form after certain attacks, which can both help and halt his progress in each level. New forms of Wario include Invisible Wario and Ball of Yarn Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario inside).

Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt stomp don't become available to Wario until after completing a certain amount of levels, meaning you have to go back to completed levels to access other areas full of loot.</desc>

As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</desc>

    <name>Wendy - Every Witch Way </name>
    <desc>While exploring her house's attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest.  Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy's house!  It's up to Wendy to set things right again!

Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game.  As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity.  Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself – by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction.  Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching – you'll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game's different puzzles.

Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic.  For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase.  Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions.  The stars also act as Wendy's health meter – if you get hit, you'll lose a star, as well as some magical power.  Get hit when you have no stars left, and you'll lose a life.

At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick.  In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</desc>

    <name>Wings of Fury  </name>
    <desc>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.

It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.

 
You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.

The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</desc>

Grand Prix stages races on the same tracks, but players are awarded points based on where they finish. Doing well in the races in both modes allows you to upgrade your vehicle. Both the Sprint and Time Trial modes allow for competition without the bloodlust of the other two modes. If you want to compete against another person, you can via a link cable.

    <name>Worms Armageddon  </name>
    <desc>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET. 

For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 

Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.</desc>

    <desc>WWF Betrayal is not the typical WWF game, instead the gameplay is more reminiscent of Double Dragon.  The player starts off as one of either four different superstars including The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker or "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, after which the story kicks in.  The story consists of the player's selected wrestler just moments away from winning the WWF Championship before getting hit from behind by an unknown assailant and defeated.  They awake to discover that Stephanie McMahon has also kidnapped and her father Vince promises the player's character another shot at the title if they rescue Stephanie.

There are six levels to choose from as the player will transverse these stages and fight off referees, street punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various weapons scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4's along with many more objects.  Not only does the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser cannons to name a few.

There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player's health and power bar among many others.  Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash their character's unique finishing move such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected enemy.  There is also an option for a second player to join in using a link cable to team up and help out on their friend's journey.</desc>

    <desc>Like it's bigger brother on the PlayStation, X-Men: Mutant Academy on the Game Boy Color is a fighting game starring Marvel's famous mutants.

The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants (Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). There are also two additional secret characters, whose unlocking codes are revealed upon beating the game's story mode.

In addition to the story mode, in which one character takes on all the others in consecutive fights, there is a training mode, battle mode (featuring teams of three characters each), survival mode (one character taking on all others with only a single bar of health) and a versus mode utilizing the Game Link cable.

The Game Boy's two buttons are used for kicks and punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops' eye beam). During a fight, a rage bar will slowly fill, which allows using powerful special attacks activated through button combos.</desc>

1) Hack and slash with his claws (the main attack)

2) Jump (very important to get through levels)

3) Heal (stay still, and he will heal a little at a time. Just be careful, each level has a limited amount of time to complete, so don't stand around too much)

and 4) If you press the attack button (see (1)) several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time)</desc>

    <name>Yars' Revenge  </name>
    <desc>The classic Atari 2600 game YAR'S REVENGE has made its way to the Game Boy Color. You take control a giant space fly known as a Yar, and you must destroy the Qotile base on the other side of the screen. But you must first get through the large shield that guards the base. Fortunately, you have an unlimited supply of missiles to destroy the shield, or you can fly into the shield and eat a brick. Once there is an opening in the shield, touch the Qotile base with the Yar to activate the Zorlon Cannon. Once activated, you can fire the cannon to destroy the base. As you progress through the 250 levels, the game moves faster and becomes more challenging. Help Yar destroy the Qotile in YAR'S REVENGE.</desc>

    <name>Yogi Bear - Great Balloon Blast </name>
    <desc>It's the 14th annual Jellystone Park Balloon Fest. And you know what that means for Yogi...campers with pic-a-nic baskets! Yogi has a plan to get those baskets. He'll pose as a balloon salesman. He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith.

Boo Boo: "But, Yogi, the Ranger isn't going to like this."
Yogi: "Not to worry, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!"

This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on.

Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end the game.</desc>

    <name>Zebco Fishing!  </name>
    <desc>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to "hit" or "hold". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.

The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the tension. 

Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</desc>

    <desc>A talking lemur? The only place you might find such a thing is Zobooland, the magical place from the PBS series ZOBOOMAFOO. Embark on a nine-level quest to collect as many Animal Friend Cards as possible, a task that will require lots of interaction and cooperation with other creatures. Make your way across each side-scrolling level, trying to keep your energy up by eating Goobleberries. If you don't eat enough, you'll run out of energy and fall asleep losing one turn. Collecting 100 Goobleberries will earn you an extra shot at completing the game, but that won't be easy with so many other tasks to keep your mind on. The game is certainly designed for younger players, but three skill settings (easy, easier, easiest) allow the game's difficulty to expand as kids grow accustomed to the challenges. Though the journey is long, games can be saved with the use of a password.</desc>
