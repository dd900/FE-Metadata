{"Name":"PC Engine SuperGrafx","Games":[{"DatabaseID":91008,"Name":"1941: Counter Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1941 Counter Attack is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990. The action takes place during World War II and depicts Capcom's own fantastic vision of the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player's mission is rather straightforward - on board a Lockheed P-38 airplane, he must fight his way through six varied stages, take down enemy installations, battleships and other huge rockets on their narrow launching pads. Unlike its predecessors in the series, 1941 Counter Attack traded the trademark and arguably monotonous level design for a more structured and diverse formula. Stages vary from an enemy infested canyon to city landscapes and fortified strongholds. Several powerups can be collected along the way, such as tiny wingmen widening the plane's fire power, or destructive special weapons such as laser beams and side rockets. The main weapon can also be charged up by holding the fire button to discharge a powerful attack. Finally, the plane comes with a small life bar and can be hit three time before being blasted into oblivion - this bar however increases as the game progresses, and is used to release devastating special attacks as well. 1941 Counter Attack also features a two simultaneous player mode.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QiMtDGXV0E","Platform":"PC Engine SuperGrafx","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"b5f4433e-6af4-448c-bdcf-c03d9752eff3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"ee6e27d4-8994-4b28-a06f-fa92736ae107.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"86c558ca-71ea-41cc-8b9d-40c210197000.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"edabae87-c4fe-45db-af26-aad192f3efac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"eaa12f8c-796a-439b-bfc3-f6e2c867e690.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"7759076b-3231-41f2-a40a-d1b0a57b419a.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"ab45d3eb-c438-4b27-b154-b3c8d2ad265c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"1f865073-67cc-4063-8cff-694bff8dafec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"f04730fa-d462-4577-9a23-458d00729aac.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"cf3d1fd6-04e8-4751-84ab-cd957cfb477d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"056cb203-7031-4963-8a02-0a162c60a7f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"ed41b1a6-201c-4aef-9fcf-83b63eb7e49e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"7475276a-ba2e-40c9-8afe-56a1b88a292a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91008,"FileName":"f67420b2-d390-49ba-9c61-bee72e3ebbe1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91009,"Name":"Aldynes: The Misson Code for Rage Crisis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The year is 2020, and global depression has descended upon the societies of the Earth.

The League of Nations collaborates with NASA to produce a powerful space fighter under project name Aldynes. When a pilot known as Fox-A is killed, his girlfriend Hiroko heads to the air base where works on Project Aldynes took place. As the aliens launch their attack, Hiroko hijacks one of the fighters and enters the battle.\n\nAldynes is a horizontally-scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up. Player-controlled spaceship can acquire power-ups that either change its default vulcan gun to lasers that shoot either straight ahead or in different directions, or enhance the shot of an already equipped weapon. A special power-up adds a small ship that fights alongside the player-controlled one; collecting more power-ups of the same kind adds more ships. These ships can be ordered to stay behind and repeat the shooting patterns of the player-controlled craft, or shoot at enemies following their own AI. \n\nThe player-controlled fighter does not have hit points and loses a life every time it is hit. There are seven stages altogether, each ending with a massive boss battle.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvBctR39Rd0","Platform":"PC Engine SuperGrafx","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Produce","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"6073b5d3-ee2e-40cd-9f9d-09a31f5f13de.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"6b2f024d-d460-4caa-9557-a5b6802153dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"afa6a102-2407-41c8-9ba2-e3eb4f828f17.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"e474203d-7d8f-4349-81da-cbe95deca636.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"773a8c11-773a-43c0-b1c0-cceafc14d2e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"6ca97233-376e-4265-8058-aa8374cd28a3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"b8df2d6c-effe-4095-8371-7606239d2fb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"803a3085-f741-4007-b79c-b55368323c69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"0717cd5d-10f9-4497-9702-7e541c125cfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91009,"FileName":"721f648d-a0e4-412c-ae3d-3b7cc8df198f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":91009,"AlternateName":"Aldynes","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":91012,"Name":"Battle Ace","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Battle Ace is an action-oriented flight game in a first-person perspective.

Arthur starts the game equipped with a short joust spear that he can throw at his enemies. Treasure chests appear from time to time (usually triggered by jumping over specific spots of the scenery) and Arthur can crack them open to reveal new weapons, brand new piece of armors or, if already equipped with one, the almighty Golden Armor. But treasure chests can also reveal mean sorcerers who won't hesitate to turn our hero into an elderly man with a walking stick, or a cute but particularly vulnerable duck. Finally, the Golden Armor can be charged up and unleash powerful attacks from the equipped weapon. For instance, the spear can trigger a lighting spell and daggers a mirror-image of Arthur.

But soon they realize they are not alone and find themselves in the middle of a raging war between two alien species. The player takes control of an armored robot able to transform into three different warriors. Each one of them comes with its own style of play and abilities - the Red Warrior uses a powerful laser sword and can trigger earthquake attacks, the Green Warrior uses a laser bow and can fly, and finally the Blue Warrior uses a spear and can raise an impenetrable power shield. Special items are dotted around each level - their range from extra lives to the one-hit silver shield (S) and the temporary invincibility gold shield (G). Along with the special items found on the playfield, little rabbits also sometimes appear and drop power-ups when killed. These upgrade the player's main weapons up to three times, increasing their overall range or shooting speed. Granzort features seven large maze-like stages and each one of them lead to a deep pit where the level's boss hides.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N6YxGVsams","Platform":"PC Engine SuperGrafx","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Mutech","Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"b1a9206a-5135-4184-9c24-d501169f20ff.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"74e2edce-89ae-4f0b-93cd-3bbba4bc4afa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"7cadb093-f11b-4035-a4cf-c49a07ae8ab8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"d145e197-ad74-4267-bbe7-c2513e93cfdd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"8762e8c9-cd9a-460e-afdd-8e93ae2824a6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"943dedcc-9aab-4752-a6ab-3e51fc7243ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"0ef06da8-f086-49f7-b7cc-a4567fd5d8cd.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"9abee12a-c8f0-4e6f-8e89-272da856391f.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"14c86dc1-6b83-4561-a102-e93398b32b9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91011,"FileName":"20af403f-f672-4b46-9e2a-77a70a83c5e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":91011,"AlternateName":"Madou King Granzort","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":165654,"Name":"Madou Ou Granzort","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Madou Ou Granzort (\"Magical King Granzort\") is a SuperGrafx game released in 1990 and one of a handful of games built specifically for the console.
