It is a 3D remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, the first game in the Mana series. It was released worldwide for Android and iOS on February 4, 2016; a PlayStation Vita version was also released on the same date in Japan, and in June 2016 in North America and Europe. In addition to these releases, Square Enix is considering developing a PlayStation 4 version.\n\nThe player takes the role of a young hero who, together with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on sword combat, and is seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies.\n\nThe idea for the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern platforms for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake should be done in 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it could be used as a base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some calling it a better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Square Enix","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":97367,"FileName":"dbc34d2e-45d0-4f8a-9bfe-2ac9a44904a0.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30235,"Name":"Amazing Runner","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30235,"FileName":"b3484276-d56d-417d-9dd8-84f99f13f571.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15249,"Name":"Angry Birds","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Angry Birds is a strategy game similar to titles such as Crush the Castle where it is the player's job to help the angry birds retrieve their eggs that have been stolen by nasty green pigs.

Tactical view is for planning and setting optimal squad path. Squad screen for buying, selling, upgrading or changing order of units. Battle view for directly controlling commander on the battlefield and placing special abilities, like repair that heals units, or aim that focuses squad fire on a single selected tower.\n\nThere are three important additions in Anomaly 2. The first one is the ability to morph units into their second mech form. Mech form grants different abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The second addition is the inclusion of new and more sophisticated types of enemies, units and abilities. For example one new tower absorbs squad fire and if its meters is completely full it will transform into a stronger tower. The last one is a multiplayer mode where one player controls the towers and the other one the convoy.

It is a variation on their browser game Candy Crush.[1]\n\n\nDifferent \"special candies\" can be formed by matching a combination of 4 or 5 in a certain formation, such as a \"Striped\" candy (which clears either an entire row or column), a \"Wrapped\" candy (which acts like a bomb; clearing the 8 surrounding candies, falling, and exploding one more time), or a \"Color Bomb\" (which removes all candies with the same color of the one it is matched with). Special Candies can also be matched together, producing varying effects; for example, matching a color bomb with a striped candy turns all of the candies of its color into striped candies, which are immediately detonated.\n\nOther special candies which appear on the boards for free can be purchased from the in-game store, or won from the Candy Crush Booster Wheel. These include Jelly Fish in jelly clearing boards which clear 3 pieces from the board at random, the Coconut Wheel on ingredient dropping boards which changes three candies in a row into striped candies, and Lucky Candy in recipe boards which when matched change to one of the types of pieces the player needs to clear the objective. The Booster Wheel also offers a chance to win a jackpot of all boosters in one spin.\n\nOther pieces known as Blockers appear on boards to add to the challenge: Icing (also called Meringues) cannot be moved and can only be removed by matching next to it, Liquorice Locks cage of single pieces of candy to prevent them from use, Chocolate pieces will multiply if not cleared, Liquorice Swirls cannot be removed with Special Candies, Candy Bombs will explode and end the level early if they are not cleared, Multilayered Icing requires multiple matches to remove, Chocolate Spawners will produce Chocolate pieces at all times, Marmalade guards Special Candies from use, Cake Bombs can clear the entire board once cleared, and Toffee Tornadoes move on the board destroying pieces and shattering the tile beneath them to prevent use for one turn. Other pieces also appear on levels such as Chameleon Candies which switch colors every turn, Mystery Candies which randomly turn into a Special Candy or a Blocker, and Extra Time Candies on time limit levels.\n\nThe player can also purchase various Boosters to attempt to win levels more easily or extend play after a lost level; Lollipop Hammer clears a single piece from the board, Extra Moves can be purchased if running out of moves at the end of a game, Free Switch allows players to switch two pieces that do not possibly match, Sweet Teeth to clear out Blockers and Jelly, Bomb Coolers to add onto Candy Bomb timers if the timer runs out, and the Bubblegum Troll to stop Chocolate Spawners from spawning chocolate from its sides. The Dreamworld levels have their own special boosters: the Restore Balance booster to reset the Moon Scale for 5 turns and the Moon Struck booster to automatically activate Moon Struck.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJjCGmMkAIw","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34528,"FileName":"8200a72b-3fd8-401d-9905-4e8e60cb1be4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34528,"FileName":"d12f6333-69f7-4ed6-9782-72ac69e47292.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34527,"Name":"Candy Crush Soda Saga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"On October 20, 2014, the Facebook version of Candy Crush Soda Saga was released worldwide[21] and the mobile app was released in November on the Android and iOS platforms.[22][23][24] The app was subsequently made available for Windows 10 and Windows Phone in October 2015.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y_TiOJXVbo","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34527,"FileName":"2d491e7c-6e5a-4b31-bf55-f244ea7b04b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34527,"FileName":"f81c11e7-5ade-46ca-b203-3f7d122c9a5b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19250,"Name":"CanYouTilt","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hj06Gipd2U","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mohsen Rahimifar","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19250,"FileName":"595aa541-6855-4719-aff0-00ffbf4b6f87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25689,"Name":"Carnivores 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Carnivores 2 is a hunting simulation in the vein of Deer Hunter. Instead of hunting cute woodland creatures however the player gets to hunt big, hungry dinosaurs. The story is set in the far future and mankind has mastered galactic travel. On a distant watery planet we discover species completely identical to Earth's ancient dinosaurs living quite happily on a series of lush islands. Being the enlightened galaxy-spanning species that we are, we decide to bring in a bunch of big-game hunters to blow their brains out and bring em' home stuffed and mounted.\n\nIn the PC version there is a total of nine huntable dinosaurs, as well as several additional species which serve to populate the environment. The latter can be shot too, but they are not rewarded with kill trophies. The game is set in an open environment played from a first-person perspective. The dinosaur-hunting company has provided a gun, a map, some binoculars, a \"dinosaur call whistle\" and a license to kill things. The player travels through woods, climbs mountains, and even picks through the decrepit remains of deserted research outposts in the search for the next kill. The game requires a tactical approach. Dinosaurs have keen hearing, sight, and smell and will run away if they detect the presence of a hunter. Often a downwind approach is needed, and the hunter needs to hide behind a rock or tree, and uses a mating call to lure them in for the perfect shot. Of course the highlight of the game is the challenge in hunting hunters, the carnivores.\n\nCarnivores will stalk the hunter whether he is hunting them or he is just passing through their territory. The whistle's herbivore mating call or the sound of gunfire may inadvertedly alert them to the hunter's presence and location. Instead of charging head-on into the waiting maw of the shotgun, they can circle through the underbrush, dodging out of sight and ambushing from the sides. Despite their aggressiveness they are not stupid. If the hunter camps out in a clearing on top of a hill with a sniper rifle they will stay in the woods instead of charging out into the open where a clear shot is much easier. The exception to this is the huge Tyrannosaurus, who are disdainful of the puny bullets and will simply charge like an oncoming freight train.\n\nThe hunter starts in the woods with a pistol stalking herbivores. Each killed dinosaur earns points which can be spent on better weapons (six in total), new areas such as marshlands and deserts, or the right to hunt a larger selection of dinosaurs including carnivores. The more expensive dinosaurs get fiercer and bigger, and eventually enough points will be earned for the privilege of challenging the T-Rex.\n\nThe iOS, Android and Mini versions are enhanced ports of the original game. Next to the updated graphics it adds the Pachycephalosaurus, Amargasaurus, Oviraptor, Utahraptor, and Troodon as new dinosaurs and Ravaren's Bridge from Carnivores: Ice Age as a new map. From that game also comes the supply ship that picks up the corpses and a photo camera to take pictures of the animals in an exploration-type game mode free of blood. A relocate option allows the hunter to start at a new location during a single hunt. It can be used multiple times and also refreshes the supplies. Next to the the original Hunt mode these versions add a Survive mode where the hunter needs to stay alive as long as possible. The wind locator has been moved inside the compass to make more room on the screen. Most of the new content was not available right away, but added in gradually through updates. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. For Android an iOS there is a free-to-play version with microtransactions. In the Android version two additional bundles can be purchased to expand the game and access everything, while for iOS there is a separate commercial app with everything unlocked.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter; Sports","Developer":"Action Forms","Publisher":"Tatem Games","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25689,"FileName":"5d4a9f3e-2927-4cd9-a4b7-cc92e6d13067.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":25689,"FileName":"ce5f9b9b-016e-4552-89c5-802da4c88e02.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20602,"Name":"Chaneques","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Combine the skills of these mexican pixies to solve fun and challenging puzzles.

The player chooses a team of characters, selects a mission, then conducts a series of gem-matching battles to earn experience and items, unlock new playable characters, and progress the storyline.\n\nMissions are grouped into \"seasons\", working backward from season 7 (i.e., when season 7 is complete, the player moves on to season 6). Each season of the game represents a warped version of events from a given season of the revived TV show (2005-present), where one or more antagonists have changed established events to serve their own ends.\n\nEach character is associated with a gem color; completing a match of three or more gems results in an attack from that character, and a charge to his or her unique special move. Those moves may include a powerful extra attack, healing the party, stunning one or more enemies, or other status effects. Matching pink gems restores some of the party's energy, which enemy attacks continually drain. Unlike many gem-matching games, for a short time the player is free to drag a given gem anywhere on the play field, displacing other gems in the process and allowing the player to carefully set up and execute large and elaborate combos.\n\nAs characters earn experience they move up in level, allowing the player to assign limited bonuses to their attack, healing, or base HP statistics. Every ten levels, a character's experience is capped. To break the cap and allow further development, the player needs to find (or, optionally, purchase) a combination of special items. Players may also purchase extra characters or costumes from the store -- although most are also available in the normal course of play.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vhDPbJ63ic","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Seed Studios","Publisher":"Tiny Rebel Games","ReleaseDate":"2013-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":138232,"FileName":"3b39db0e-faef-43cb-8724-04bad4287575.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138232,"FileName":"0cd1614c-ea5d-45e0-883b-b6d2b301a811.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30216,"Name":"Doodle Jump","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Doodle Jump is a platforming video game developed and published by Lima Sky, for Windows Phone, iOS, BlackBerry, Android, Java Mobile (J2ME), Nokia Symbian, and Xbox 360 for the Kinect platform.[1] It was released worldwide for iOS on April 6, 2009, and was later released for Android and Blackberry on March 2, 2010, Symbian on May 1, 2010, and Windows Phone 7 on June 1, 2011 (Re-Released August 21, 2013 Windows Phone 8).

This is done by rotating dials to create pathways for the droplitz. Each dial consists of a small pipe piece and these pipes needs to be connected to create the necessary flow. Droplitz are limited and will vaporize when meeting a dead end. When all droplitz are gone the game is over. Whenever a path has been made a purple bonus droplitz appears. When the bonus droplitz has reached the bottom the path is destroyed and adjacent dials will drop down and take its place.The difficulty also increases for every path that is destroyed. A new theme is unlocked for every five difficulty levels reached. As the player completes levels, the speed of the game and the size of the board increases. In total there are nine boards (levels).\n\nThe game consists of four game modes: Classic, Zendurance Challenge, Power Up and Infection. The latter three are unlocked when reaching high scores in the mode above them, starting at 75,000 points for the Zendurance Challenge mode and then increasing for each mode. In Zendurance Challenge mode the player gets to choose a theme (that he's unlocked) and has to survive as long as possible at a constant pace. In Power Ups player earns different power-ups, that can be used for destroying parts of the board, freezing the board or slowing down the speed of the drops. In Infection mode dials can get infected which makes them harder to rotate, which means they can only be destroyed if a path is made through them.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-06-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15457,"FileName":"7db4c7ee-57fe-4915-8c34-7f29bf10d9ee.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15457,"FileName":"3fa936b7-b694-444d-a544-ae6be10d5029.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15457,"FileName":"bb7c3050-374b-4d24-abcd-a4b70138a92c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15457,"FileName":"695a43b9-940c-44bf-898f-91d1d0322820.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29908,"Name":"Eliss Infinity","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Steph Thirion","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-03-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":29908,"FileName":"9b2d114b-c89e-4c35-9e54-a413ec7efb67.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167374,"Name":"Elman España: Anarchy ","ReleaseYear":"2017","Overview":"In Elman España: Anarchy the player controls the character based on the Spanish model Elman España.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. \n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! \n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's? \n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\n*Used in FNaF for PC","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4UTOek0-Y","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Horror","Developer":"Scott Cawthon","Publisher":"Scott Cawthon","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27861,"FileName":"2b9a8129-58ef-4df2-ad90-e7ea44e97433.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27862,"Name":"Five Nights at Freddy's 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters.

It is the first iOS video game to run on the Unreal Engine. In the game, the unnamed player character fights a series of one-on-one battles in a derelict castle to face the immortal God King. When in battle, players swipe the screen to attack and parry, and tap the screen to dodge and block enemy attacks. Upon victory or defeat, the player restarts the game as the character's descendant with the same items and experience level.\n\nThe game was developed by a team of twelve people, who took two months to make a playable demo and three more to finish the game. Infinity Blade was intended to demonstrate the new iOS version of the Unreal Engine, and to combine the swordplay of Karateka and Prince of Persia with the loneliness of Shadow of the Colossus. The game received four free expansions that added new equipment, endings, and game modes.\n\nInfinity Blade was the fastest-grossing app in the history of iOS upon its release. It made US$1.6 million in its first four days, and over US$23 million by the end of 2011. It was well received by gaming critics. Reviews heavily praised the graphics and compared the mobile game favorably to console games. Critics also praised the swipe-based combat system, but split opinions on the cyclical gameplay as either addictive or repetitive.

The game was first released exclusively for Android devices on November 15, 2012,[2][5] and was made available for Apple's iOS on July 14, 2014.[3][6] The game has a complex science fiction back story with a continuous open narrative,[7][8] which however is not necessary for playing and enjoying the game. Ingress has also been considered to be a location-based exergame.[9]\n\nThe gameplay consists of capturing \"portals\" at places of cultural significance, such as public art, landmarks, monuments, etc., and linking them to create virtual triangular \"control fields\" over geographical areas. Progress in the game is measured by the number of \"mind units\" (MUs) captured via such control fields, i.e. people nominally controlled by each faction (as illustrated on the Intel Map).[10][11] The necessary links between portals may range in length from meters to kilometers or hundreds of kilometers, created in operations of considerable logistical complexity.[12] International links and fields are not uncommon, as Ingress has attracted an enthusiastic following in cities worldwide[13] amongst both young and old,[14] to the extent that the gameplay is itself a lifestyle for some, including tattoos.[2] Gameplay relies heavily on the player physically moving about the community in order to interact with portals. Playing in a vehicle is possible, but increases in speed disable some features of the game, both for safety reasons and in order to encourage physical activity.\n\nIn addition to the main interactive map, called the Scanner, players also have access to a \"COMM\" tab that displays local and regional, even worldwide, live activity going on within the game, such as faction progress and activity, in-game communication, and alerts.\n\nEach player, or \"Agent\", also has a profile page that is viewable by any other agent using the mobile app. Profiles contain a wide variety of information, including the agent's name, current level and AP, earned badges, completed missions, and a long list of stats. Players can choose to withhold most of the statistical information from appearing on their page, instead leaving visible only their badges, AP and mission list. Also available on the profile page, if the agent so decides, is a link to their Google+ page.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVRosEF-1PY","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":32188,"FileName":"c4569863-9047-4484-a3a6-3497b7cd755e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15690,"Name":"Iron Man 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Iron Man 2 is a 2010 action-adventure video game loosely based on the film of the same name.

It was released online as a Flash version on May 11, 2012;[2] on Android on September 28;[3] on PlayStation Portable (via PlayStation Network, ported by Beatshapers) on November 20 in North America and November 21 in Europe;[4] on BlackBerry PlayBook on December 13, 2012;[5] on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita (via PlayStation Network, ported by Big Ant Studios) on December 21 in Europe and December 31 in North America;[6] on BlackBerry 10 on March 6, 2013;[7] and on Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 on June 5.[8][9]\n\nThe game features the same protagonist as Monster Dash, Barry Steakfries, who the player controls as he steals a jet pack from a top-secret laboratory. The game has been met with very favorable reviews, and has won numerous awards.\n\n\nThe game uses a simple, one-touch system to control the jetpack; when the player presses anywhere on the touchscreen, the jetpack fires and Barry rises. When the player lets go, the jetpack turns off, and Barry falls. Because he is continually in motion, the player does not control his speed, simply his movement along the vertical axis.\n\nThe objective of the game is to travel as far as possible, collect coins, and avoid hazards such as zappers, missiles and high-intensity laser beams. As the player travels, golden coloured \"Spin Tokens\" occasionally appear, which the player can collect. At the end of each run, these spin tokens are used in a slot machine (one token gives one spin) which can award the player various prizes, including coins, additional spin tokens, a head-start, a player revival, and explosives that can propel the player's body some distance after death. If the player does not wish to spin the slot, they can cash in all remaining spin tokens for 50 coins each.\n\nRainbow-coloured boxes with gears can also be found throughout the game. When touched by the player, these boxes provide Barry with a vehicle which lasts until he hits an obstacle. The available vehicles are \"Bad As Hog\" (a chopper), \"Mr. Cuddles\" (a mecha dragon), \"Crazy Freaking Teleporter\" (a teleport device), \"Gravity Suit\" (the suit used by Gravity Guy, providing the same ability[10]), \"Profit Bird\" (a bird-shaped plane which ejects banknotes), and \"Wave Rider\" (a jet ski). Also available until January 1, 2014 is \"Sleigh of Awesome\" (a sleigh drawn by two reindeer). These vehicles are also available in Magnetic and Golden upgrades that can be purchased for coins in \"The Stash\" (the in-game store). In a later update, the \"Strong Arm Machine\" (S.A.M.) was introduced. The only obstacles faced while wearing the S.A.M. are missiles, which the player must deflect these with his arm. This vehicle, unlike the others, is only available after the player has collected three puzzle pieces, spelling \"SAM\", in one day. If the player activates the S.A.M. five days in a row, a special costume is made available.[11]\n\nThe Stash also sells aesthetic upgrades such as character outfits and different jetpacks. Most of these items do not alter the gameplay in any way, though alternative jetpacks can be useful in achieving some of the missions (such as travelling a distance without harming any scientists). Limited use utilities are also for sale, as are gadgets and vehicle upgrades. Gadgets provide permanent enhancements for the player, but Barry can have only two gadgets equipped at any one time. Players can also access their profile from within The Stash, view achievements on Game Center, and purchase coins with real world money.\n\nAt any time in the game, the player is provided with three missions, such as high-fiving (running past) a certain number of scientists, avoiding coins for a set distance, or flying close to a certain number of zappers. Each individual mission carries one to three stars, depending on its difficulty. When each mission is completed, the stars are added to the player's experience level and a fresh mission appears (unless the player has enough missions to make it past level 15). Once the number of stars required for the experience level are obtained, the player's level increases and a coin reward is given. Once the highest level is reached, the player is given the choice of either playing the game without any more missions, or trading the level 15 stars to start the game with new missions. The level titles (e.g. \"Graduate\", \"Ninja\") remain the same, but the level numbers increase, so a player will start from level 16 with the title \"Beginner\". If the player cashes in their stars, they are also given one of 125 badges selected at random, showing that the complete set of missions have been achieved. Players can cash in stars multiple times once they reach the title \"Barry\", to collect more badges and reach a higher level number. Mission unlocks are available in The Stash, which allow the player to get the stars for a mission without completing the mission through gameplay, at the cost of 5000 coins per star","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzxi8nid9BQ","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30065,"FileName":"fdc3924f-e470-48cf-a9d9-ffed37ba84c7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30065,"FileName":"cbd67692-ef1a-47ce-9a2b-d6eae4094d1a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15723,"Name":"Joe Danger","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Joe Danger is a video game, the first published by British independent developer Hello Games.

The player controls the eponymous daredevil and navigates time-limited courses, aiming to complete enough objectives to continue to further rounds. Joe Danger is presented in a light-hearted way, with emphasis on stunts and maintaining speed.\n\nIt was released on the PlayStation Network in June 2010, after Hello Games originally chose to publish it exclusively with Sony Computer Entertainment. A \"Special Edition\" for Xbox Live Arcade was released on 14 December 2011; an iOS spinoff was released on 10 January 2013. In April 2015, a version for Android was released through the Google Play Store.[8]\n\nThe game was promoted in the media through interviews with the four members of the development team, in particular with Hello Games's managing director, Sean Murray. The team used their official website and Sony's PlayStation Blog to maintain contact with fans and to keep them up to date on the project's progress. Much of the quality assurance process took the form of public beta testing at exhibitions.\n\nOn its release, Joe Danger received generally positive reviews; most reviewers praised the accessible gameplay and the ability to edit courses while playing them. Some suggested the game would have benefited from more options, such as sharing and rating user-generated content, and criticised the lack of an online multiplayer mode. Hello Games subsequently released downloadable content to add features that users and reviewers had requested in the months following the game's release. Using leaderboard statistics, Joe Danger was estimated to have sold at least 108,000 units in its first three months on sale. It was nominated for several awards, including the grand prize at the 2010 Independent Games Festival.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5K9cwZT7GY","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2010-01-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15723,"FileName":"68b4d216-c43c-4b5b-9196-b8e160296257.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17498,"Name":"Kingdom Rush","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kingdom Rush is a tower defense game developed by Ironhide Game Studio and published by Armor Games, released as a free flash browser game on July 28, 2011,[1] on the iPad on December 19, 2011, on Android in May 2013, and a Unity port in January 2014 via Steam.

It is part of the Tomb Raider series, but unlike previous games, the game does not carry the Tomb Raider brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay. In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec. They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke. A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following or helping Lara.\n\nIn the United States and United Kingdom, Guardian of Light was released for the Xbox Live Arcade on 18 August 2010; it was released a month later on 28 September for PlayStation Network and Steam. Though local cooperative was available at the initial release for all versions, online cooperative was later added. In North America, on 16 December 2010, the video game was released for iOS devices which included cooperative with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth options. The first downloadable content (DLC) map pack was released for free for a limited time.\n\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light was well received by critics. The Xbox 360 version of the game holds an average score of 85/100 and 86.36% on the game aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. In September 2010, IGN listed Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light fourteenth in their top twenty-five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time. Critics felt that the game was an excellent fit for Lara Croft.[2] Guardian of Light sold 98,000 copies on Xbox Live in its first six weeks,[3] and as of 22 August 2013, the game has sold more than 1 million copies on all platforms.[4] A sequel titled Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris was released in 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[5]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJlLXv8w54o","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2010-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15750,"FileName":"e67ae97f-999b-4e9a-abc7-c00489da9bdc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15750,"FileName":"dd12a73d-c3ac-4a91-b087-1632d63b0778.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30219,"Name":"League of Evil 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"League of Evil is an iOS game developed by Ravenous Games Inc. and released by February 3, 2011.

The amount and type of matches determine which of the six monsters on the player's team attack the waves of enemy monsters and how much damage they do. An additional layer of challenge is the acquisition, selection, and improvement of a team of monsters from among thousands ranging from standard fantasy fare, to deities from several religions and mythologies and characters from popular entertainment franchises.\n\nThe game is free-to-play and financed by the sale of in-game currency. It has seen great commercial success in Japan, where it was downloaded 32 million times by November 2014, and was also released in other Asian countries as well as in North America and many European countries.

The game is known for its developers' battle against a cloned version of their game released by another company. The game was developed and published by Vlambeer—Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman—and released for iOS on March 14, 2013, and later that year for Android.\n\nPlayers cast a fishing line into the ocean and use motion controls to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish out of the sky for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.\n\nRidiculous Fishing received \"near-universal perfect scores\" at launch[1]—what review score aggregator Metacritic describes as \"universal acclaim\".[2] It won an Apple's 2013 Design Award and was their iPhone game of the year. Reviewers noted Vlambeer's struggle against the copy of their game and praised the game's balance and both visual and game design.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30055,"FileName":"60751ee5-666d-4980-8cb1-cd9622569d11.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30055,"FileName":"8673414a-3884-4c8e-a554-f27c3caa3988.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31993,"Name":"Riptide GP2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Riptide GP™2 kicks everything into overdrive, with intense online multi-player races, upgradeable hydro jets and riders, improved graphics, an all-new career mode, and a whole new stunt system with dozens of new tricks!\nFeaturing rocket-powered hydro jets racing around futuristic tracks across a dynamic and interactive water surface, Riptide GP2 delivers a fast, fun, and visually stunning racing experience.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrnI5Du9deU","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Vector Unit","Publisher":"Vector Unit","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31993,"FileName":"3b3e93a8-688b-4b3d-8cea-aebc7f1a324b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31993,"FileName":"a4000ed6-f5d9-4a7b-937e-01cd9f63540b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30220,"Name":"Robbery Bob","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30220,"FileName":"41d6d13e-3543-424c-9326-5a8b35859e57.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202736,"Name":"ROBLOX","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"ROBLOX is a game creation tool where players can create games and share them with the world using the ROBLOX Studio bundled in with the PC version of the game.","MaxPlayers":"700","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPV2gc13bWM","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"","Developer":"ROBLOX Corporation","Publisher":"Roblox Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2012-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30166,"Name":"Robot Unicorn Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Robot Unicorn Attack is an online \"endless running\" video game featured on the Adult Swim and Flashline Games website.

The update added ten new levels, twenty-four new Game Center achievements, new music, more story elements and a new insect (the hornet).[2] A year after the game's initial release, a HD version was released for the iPad.[3] In 2013, the game was also released for Android.[4] A sequel, Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon, was released in August 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and Linux.[5]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":29949,"FileName":"392f271d-e00f-40f6-82e8-b06e017cff0c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25266,"Name":"Splash Damage: Survive if you can","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Splash Damage is an arcade, platforming game, where two pools of liquids want you to drown.

The Emperor and Darth Vader both know this, so they come up with a plan to pose as if they are using it for apartments and shopping. All the extra credits made will be put towards the real goal; rebuilding the actual Death Star in the basement!\n\nStar Wars: Tiny Death Star is very similar to Nimblebit's previous game Tiny Tower. The goal is still the same; build apartments and stores to make money which will be used towards more floors (or Imperial floors which make no money but can build parts used for missions instead). The game features two different currency types. There is the main \"regular\" currency Credits, as well as the \"premium\" currency Bux. The Credits are used for buying floors, and the Bux can be used for either buying premium items such as upgraded elevators, new characters or cutting down on waiting for items to be built or restocked.\n\nThere are four different categories of shopping floors to choose from: Food, Service, Recreation and Retail. There's also Residential and Imperial floors. To maximize profit the player has to see which floors are in demand to get the most people to visit them. To further increase income the player can put Bitizen's in their dream jobs, which will make the floor stock twice as many of one out of the three items available.\n\nThere are several types of special missions and events available which will give the player prices (either Credits or Bux). The emperor gives out certain tasks such as \"evict a Bitizen\" or \"build 3 floors\", the Empire will have special requests which require assembling items in the Imperial floors, and the player can also be tasked with finding specific characters or bitizens hiding in one of the floors.\n\nThere is a gallery section where alien races, celebrities from the movies, floors and special little cut scenes can be viewed once unlocked. Making a return from Tiny Tower under a new name, the player can also view the Death Star version of Bitbook called Holonet where the bitizens post updates about their ongoing lives in the Death Star.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30262,"FileName":"eeb1efe6-250f-4726-afed-e5bda3c89d84.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32633,"Name":"StarMap 3D Plus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"No in-app purchases necessary!

Many buildings come with a questline for the player to follow and some add with them a character from the series; players collect characters along with buildings. Characters can be sent on tasks to progress with the quests to advance with the game, and to earn extra money to save up for items. Each building regularly generates a sum of in-game cash to collect, under names such as \"Income tax\" from houses and the \"Collection plate\" from the First Church of Springfield. Players can also place rivers, roads, pavement and decorations on the land. In 2013, developers added the \"Krustyland\" transporter, to get players from Springfield to the infamous Krustyland, where they can expand and build similar to player interactions in the game's Springfield.\n\nThe game is supported by EA's Origin, which acts as a social bridge to where players log in to their Origin accounts and visit friends' towns to collect cash once every 24 hours; and occasionally other tasks during an event.\n\nThere is a hidden easter egg where, in order to obtain the statue of Jebediah Springfield decoration, the player must tap Homer 10 times in a row whilst he is performing any task. This action also gives the player 10 free donuts, but can only work once.\n\nThe maximum number of levels is currently 59 since the November 10, 2015 update.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGr0UIX8T_k","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Fox Digital Entertainment, Inc.","Publisher":"EA Mobile","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30205,"FileName":"7e87c734-49cd-4c94-883b-968f79aac960.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30205,"FileName":"fb8f8b71-c5bf-4b21-afb3-0a16ec5aa5bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30205,"FileName":"fc05cfb0-c205-4381-b1c0-91a242d50897.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17112,"Name":"The Witness","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=https://tk-RsawGjPY&feature=youtube_gdata_player","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Jonathan Blow","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":17112,"FileName":"dc2a30ee-7d17-4f07-a916-61fb88b186a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135708,"Name":"The World Ends with You: Solo Remix","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Square Enix","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2012-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135708,"FileName":"e0f094f2-4dec-49f2-bad1-592c708276c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166902,"Name":"Them Bombs","ReleaseYear":"2017","Overview":"Them Bombs is a 2D couch co-op game for 2-4 people, in which one of the players has to defuse a bomb by disarming all of its modules before the timer runs out.

Game Center provides achievements, leaderboards (based on the number of floors players have) and challenges sent by others. It also allows the player to compare with their Game Center friends' towers. However, Android devices are integrated with the Mobage social gaming network, and unlike Apple's Game Center, an internet connection and a Mobage user name are required to play Tiny Tower.\n\nOn August 24, 2015, Mobage has announced the shutdown of Tiny Tower along with five other Mobage games. The shutdown of the Android version of Tiny Tower was announced for September 24, 2015.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30250,"FileName":"f7ad6969-7150-4625-937b-de9e99ea8744.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29960,"Name":"Tiny Wings","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":29960,"FileName":"8ef02dd2-d262-4db7-ab14-ca97d03ecbfd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30299,"Name":"Touchgrind Skate 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30299,"FileName":"9d5f496f-61be-4501-8dba-e7804acc5100.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30300,"Name":"Trial Xtreme 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKd543JkKko","Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30300,"FileName":"221ccc5a-5dec-409f-bc85-c1a45fe31c77.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29955,"Name":"Trism","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple iOS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Demiforce","Publisher":"Demiforce","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":29955,"FileName":"f6fde889-79d3-4d74-a3a5-778a388be8ca.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30226,"Name":"Ultimate Spider-Man: Total Mayhem","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ultimate Spider-Man: Total Mayhem (also known as Spider-Man: Total Mayhem) is an action-adventure video game for Apple iOS and Android.
