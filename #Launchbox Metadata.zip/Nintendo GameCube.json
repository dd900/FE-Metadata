The presumed era of world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called \"Heaven Smile\", which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the International Ethics Committee (IEC). Meanwhile, the relationship between the United States and Japan deteriorate, as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA.\n\nA group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government. The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as \"Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon\", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were professional assassins in their lives, and whose souls were absorbed by Harman after they were killed in a mysterious incident fifty years ago. Garcian Smith is the leading persona among these seven, and the only one who can communicate with Harman.\n\nKiller7 is a hybrid game that incorporates shooting and puzzle-solving with light role-playing elements. The player can switch between any of the seven characters during most parts of the game. Each character has unique abilities. Dan, for example, is a true marksman, while Coyote is an experienced thief with exceptional movement. The unusual cast also includes the blind Con who moves very fast, Kaede with ranged skills, Mask who has the deadliest arsenal, the albino Kevin who can turn invisible, as well as Garcian, the leader of the pack who possesses the ability of reviving the bodies of slain personalities.\n\nDespite its 3D environments, character navigation in the game is restricted: playable characters can only move along pre-determined (though often branching) paths. Drawing out a weapon switches the view to first-person perspective with free camera rotation, but no possibility to move. Typically, the player should eliminate the approaching enemy as quickly as possible before sustaining damage, using various combinations of characters and weapons. Defeated enemies (particularly those dispatched with critical hits) yield the player \"blood\", which can be turned into serum in special rooms and used to enhance the abilities of the characters. A considerable portion of the gameplay is dedicated to solving various puzzles and gathering plot-related information by conversing with the game's exotic characters.","Publisher":"Capcom Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-07-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CFGlYkkWUo0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Killer7"},"56":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Biohazard 4","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Horror; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8a5502c2-2d22-4644-bfc9-13a928439955.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"60a8afcf-43fc-4c4e-baa6-96c5f455e8a0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7c686e99-7da9-4a88-b5d7-5b7947dca0ad.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c4b1a4e2-5347-4e81-a8b7-6db738231d56.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"42d64689-95b4-4f79-a287-36e9e39d8da7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0a7691fc-3d40-4a44-ac02-4e5d7261db23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"71dece88-9faa-495d-8ef4-5858f20727b2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2aa74733-7cc2-4fbf-80e2-322e09eae7b9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"18bab13b-96f6-44e0-833f-a74ad6335587.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b11b88a6-7fe0-4f2a-ac24-316694963a9f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2c090a30-a0ac-4271-8a89-f30f95b6af4c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b02b7411-9116-4a19-b661-15f6db61c215.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e6a93c6e-15b9-4f93-b0b6-1bcca721a4f7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dc262a38-ea11-408f-96d5-a8108cc84d3c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e60b48da-76de-40b5-a904-c72ed05d505e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5ce2dbc2-baa3-4ad6-9f50-e7bde5eecc84.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ce6ab29e-c12b-46c4-8948-158a2163a5e4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"65fdcfbb-aa2c-4a3a-ba9d-903b5dd23b5d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"69f8509c-58f8-4d82-9ad1-a7be250b46ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0dc9085c-862a-4afc-ae0a-c0e96524ed13.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4fc611b1-86a9-469d-b080-495cd7e24aac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"550abc67-3cbd-4af3-997e-b38554a3fe98.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"abcf9543-f5f3-4651-a74c-67373518453b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c2fd8ab0-1e52-43e6-a485-bf20c7c708c3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Resident Evil 4","Overview":"U.S. agent Leon Kennedy has been tasked to look into the abduction of the President's daughter and his investigation has led him to a mysterious location in Europe.

The player controls Link, the protagonist of the Zelda series. He struggles against his nemesis, Ganondorf, for control of a sacred relic known as the Triforce. Link spends a large portion of the game sailing, traveling between islands, and traversing through dungeons and temples to gain the power necessary to defeat Ganondorf. He also spends time trying to find his little sister.\nThe Wind Waker follows in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time and its sequel Majora's Mask, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the two Nintendo 64 titles. A heavy emphasis is placed on using and controlling wind with a baton called the Wind Waker, which aids sailing and floating in air. Controversial during development for its use of cel shading graphics and younger Link character, The Wind Waker received acclaim on release and is one of the Nintendo GameCube's most popular games.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BP42wusaHJI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker"},"2236":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"E -

To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the colored bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same color to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.\n\nClassic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme.

After being pursued by Agents, Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package.\n\nThe package is a message to the human city Zion, warning them that the machines are tunneling to Zion with an army of Sentinels. Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense. During this operation, Niobe and Ghost provide backup to another group of operatives trying to escape.\n\nWith everyone home, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves. During the meeting, Agents attack the building they are in. Niobe and Ghost help the humans escape; when everyone is safe except them, the Keymaker, a program capable of accessing any area in the Matrix, leads them to safety through a door that he created.\n\nThe Keymaker gives the two a key that they are supposed to give to Neo, the protagonist of the film trilogy. However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now is a crime boss in the Matrix.

Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9KBZmx3UJjo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Bond_007:_Agent_Under_Fire"},"5428":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eurocom Entertainment Software","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ad58eaa9-622b-4b56-8b45-31d9bd8020d4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4a2cfdb4-0ad0-48ac-9166-a3d4326f15e8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"bf89b67b-396c-452a-8044-21e1f49446f1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"25483310-5e02-4a43-b4f5-42a7968e6f0b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5492d1a4-4e29-4a5b-ad02-f5f5ccfbab32.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2726effd-be64-4892-a2ca-63f3b3a8b0f3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10a11474-f08c-41d0-a35c-7eab00288737.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"93d0e4a9-37cc-4d99-bf46-e934be63f04a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"87985c15-98d8-4d6e-8fd8-bda2dcf16443.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"49c3985f-ab0d-4228-9f1a-b0d600fd3b99.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"249ce3a8-eb9f-4705-9a9b-6cd29ddb5eab.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e62bc623-89f4-4441-a8f2-9aa79a805d02.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6103eced-5f91-4a2d-970a-2b719e9d7dbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"7f08ca0b-8d40-4168-88d4-1d0630f8dd95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c2c468ec-0252-4e65-862b-a8b7fbb2d732.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d4030043-628c-4a3f-8c30-108933a86be2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7f38c899-a01c-4be4-b83a-89b114bda332.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"007: Nightfire","Overview":"After a thrilling night on the streets of Paris, legendary secret agent James Bond (voiced by Maxwell Caulfield with the likeness of Pierce Brosnan) is assigned to find a missing American Defense Satellite, Nightfire.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"5432":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Io","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"cc1ba3ce-67f8-41f5-9e4c-47cc046d58ad.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4a52e61f-66e4-42d4-ade9-449fbf249b0c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"46719d53-08b6-4882-af10-72fc3ba11f78.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3f3b4f7b-c925-4de7-90b4-3065cfdad655.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"15386b16-a66e-48dd-ac5a-629145bf6aaa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"97764427-ee35-4854-bb20-4b1b0309a3ac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"059296b3-22be-4851-948c-cc55d344f8c4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4bf1d133-b095-4657-b184-298e16b4da2f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"678acca4-c347-45bc-9cb5-94bfc52288b8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"73807ac9-9032-4c34-bbe4-adf8b5919b01.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin","Overview":"Hitman 2 features mission-based gameplay.

These attacks will clear enemies out for a multi-block radius, flatten entire buildings, and cause massive damage to enemies.","Publisher":"Sierra","ReleaseDate":"2005-08-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"5434":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Zelda no Densetsu: Twilight Princess","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c994f5a5-0828-4d8c-9a81-3c5f77fb6468.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"61298b6b-270e-459c-8a43-e71a5be78d04.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a9eae138-870b-46be-a05e-aadd5dc1c21b.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3e39d6a6-f365-464f-819b-c2bb16cd7979.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4d706162-e6e1-4bfa-8ac9-8f22941e9e12.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"397dd246-7c56-45c2-94e5-e15fe425bf1b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28cf1d60-9dba-430a-8034-96a6a31d2219.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"11a52f7c-e332-4ea0-b2e1-c39c16b098d3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c9dcb3dd-313d-4f02-9079-465bbc049cbc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8dafba39-6919-4c2f-a3f1-c85461a2eca9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"631fc289-48d5-408b-9d55-6b94313f10c8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2aaf468-f940-4537-86f1-744487d14cc2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9649b933-bef2-4d35-ab63-cf4c21d4cbc5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"dc1ac92a-1cc1-48fc-bb3c-40b144e3cbeb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4fd2a15d-65cd-4d8a-86e7-66424bfb4323.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"018c169d-14c2-401d-81ca-8847a89fc006.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bf87258a-63c5-4209-83be-0d4ec56b1ea1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"27c636db-e154-4235-a52a-37c9e4d76580.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"871669d0-e81a-4fed-b1e8-2494f04454a7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2c37b246-c96d-4ba1-a60c-197e4b51998f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7100a895-9fd8-4e83-9ed3-ea05b6af1a0d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"71bf036e-3b86-42e6-8529-f19752fdf5d4.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e4a3517-6e89-46e6-a67c-37de51dd0265.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3341a9f1-df72-4364-aac2-74d271e64836.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess","Overview":"In the next chapter in the Legend of Zelda series, Link can transform into a wolf to scour the darkened land of Hyrule.

It was released on the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles in the fall of 2004. Barking Lizards Technologies developed the N-Gage port of the game, which was released in early 2005. Players can play as one of fifteen X-Men characters, with the ability to switch between four computer- or human-controlled characters at any time.\n\nX-Men Legends is not set in any particular Marvel Comics universe. It follows Alison Crestmere, a young mutant who has the ability to summon and control volcanic activity. As Alison is taught to control her powers at the X-Mansion, the X-Men are sent on several missions. Eventually the X-Men learn of Magneto's plan to cover the Earth in darkness from his base on Asteroid M.\n\nX-Men Legends received generally positive reviews from critics. The Xbox version was the best received, garnering aggregate scores of 83% and 82\/100 on the review aggregating websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Reviewers praised Raven's variation on cel-shaded graphics. Due to the success of the game a sequel was made, X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v4hNQvWCNtI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-Men_Legends"},"5445":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"X-Men Legends II: El Ascenso de Apocalipsis","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Raven","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"1beeb4a2-3ea2-45ae-bced-51be131ced7a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"85975479-b8c6-4cc9-90fc-ca1bd23807f3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a0d2f959-11fc-468d-8f40-2f08cf41c462.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b647b595-7b70-43e8-a3de-998e778d9a4c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd30338e-c665-4198-94ba-6917084ee4ac.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0017258c-6cf6-4d33-9430-2c13a94deaf6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"362acef8-f3c1-446e-9f73-aa9320b83607.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c25b74fb-1d92-4ee1-8f1b-78b535fc062c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c789a5b7-fefc-4800-af5e-cfbe45aecd65.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"23a34873-d537-4772-bf28-d8f3e42d6698.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9c8b747f-4779-4b3f-b813-a68e47f13bba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse","Overview":"X-Men: Legends II - Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game and a sequel to X-Men Legends. The player controls a party of four characters, though only one at a time can be controlled directly. Beside switching the characters for combat purposes, the player is often obliged to do so, because some of the tasks in the game require the specific abilities of a certain mutant. For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.\n\nEach character has several different skills based on their mutant powers. These include melee, boost, projectile, traps, and others. Each character can also learn powerful super skill: for example, Cyclops has a super beam attack that can hit multiple targets; Wolverine has a spinning attack that inflicts heavy damage; Magneto has a metal attack, crushing everything in sight by manipulating metal objects in the environment, etc.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-Men_Legends_II:_Rise_of_Apocalypse"},"5446":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Treyarch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"c92d2e0d-11ae-44a2-9bb1-39b8716590ec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e3ede2ef-0e01-4838-ba9f-06410856947c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7f3b4c51-398c-4031-828e-93758cef6acb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3ae2b627-7695-47d5-a1db-9945f1dc87e1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2966186a-5ce0-4170-8fde-68863b017790.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"329a4f12-ab88-4abc-942d-bfd905844a07.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5f0d9774-0fe2-457f-9769-34f4bc0d51c7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b4f79d70-90d0-48ba-bdb6-da2a1ac82898.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b96fc1e7-8140-4d55-8695-b8fd8a39b675.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultimate Spider-Man","Overview":"Take on the role of the world's most famous Super Hero, Marvel's Spider-Man, and one of his most menacing nemeses, Venom, in an original storyline written and illustrated by the creative team behind the best-selling Ultimate Spider-Man comic book series.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tVVrr_auqcM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)"},"5468":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Vicarious Visions","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"122edf53-d19d-4f9c-96c0-7ce81d9fdd67.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c50b7911-914e-4713-b9db-56c66b14b790.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"50d86e5f-399e-49b1-83b4-d084918a146a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"43b057c3-a190-468b-9300-4a6eb1a3ae89.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eaf7bcb9-1aab-4926-a9af-9b220c81dbaf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a5335c18-a223-46a5-93ea-262e14092aba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1222b356-1efd-4767-a8ef-eac4ece7b8dc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c81b0273-8f5a-476c-b7ce-e5305b0a4e28.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"80fe7787-cf4f-485f-8270-d9cc05830eea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast","Overview":"Jedi Outcast puts the player into combat wielding a variety of firearms from the universe, as well as lightsabers and Force powers.

As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. \n\nThis version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.\n\nThere are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WmWdleCIEDE"},"5648":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO: Millionaire Fighting 2001","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"fa2fe544-71c6-442f-8b15-41f51f9c60d0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b65a25c5-e234-4bc8-b69e-c1feb99e8d10.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"316e7f95-0eca-4dbf-b661-1595b5661046.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"12eeb5d2-1d75-423b-8591-524ac344c09a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1a98ce00-440c-4120-8584-fe7fde1ed01a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3d988f8-1e6f-4ca9-a7fa-164a53ad2d42.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07dcc9a8-5152-44c0-ab2a-8c40cb8c6c3c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"83ee22c3-1105-4628-b6f0-69bfcff7cb9a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2d0fbd42-3241-4dbd-9a00-e52553e2cc55.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8944f843-af2b-4f6b-8e00-c58a806951b7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9d3f419e-6c61-4d99-9847-7a1725374f3a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2b023ce4-59eb-42d3-98a6-3b73d78c8be0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3bfa88cf-28fc-46be-ac7e-56656478030e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dc9be3ee-4a0a-44d2-b3c4-310052438513.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0c9c500c-85d0-4bdf-a889-c2237f6af785.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Capcom vs. SNK 2: EO","Overview":"Capcom vs. SNK 2 combines characters and gameplay elements from various Capcom and SNK fighting games, mainly the Street Fighter and The King of Fighters series. Other elements, most noticeably different fighting styles, incorporated elements from other games as well, such as Street Fighter III, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, and the Samurai Shodown series.\nIn contrast to the original Capcom vs. SNK, characters no longer have a specific \"Ratio.\" Instead the player can select up to three characters in a team and give an amount or ratio (up to four) to each as desired. In console versions of the game, players can also choose a 1-on-1 game or a 3-on-3 game in Arcade Mode with the Ratio System removed.\nUnlike the first game, which was based on The King of Fighters-style two-strength, four button system of punches and kicks, Capcom vs. SNK 2 is based on the three strength, six-button system of punches and kicks, native to the Street Fighter series, and the SNK characters have been tweaked to fit the 6-button style. The overall system is derivative of Street Fighter Alpha. However, a number of different fighting styles called 'Grooves', which mimic other Capcom and SNK games, are included in the engine. These dictate both the character's Super Gauge system, and special techniques, such as dashes, running, and guard cancels, called \"Subsystems.\" There are six in total, each designtated with a letter, along with custom grooves that can be programmed in home versions of the game. Each player designates prior to the match which groove his or her team will use.","Publisher":"Capcom Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i3INEbsMlA4"},"5649":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5b1109e4-fbb3-431a-8cc5-245a4e60e2e3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"aff3d74d-404f-42cc-b8a1-14e6c2ed1a0b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8b8e90d2-86fe-43e2-99ab-1947ac6046e6.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc6db6d3-0e1e-456b-823c-9c30d092bbb6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d341b6a7-63d1-417b-989d-1cf809f40606.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f13e33e8-5aae-4bea-ae34-7e95decb72a1.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"446d8b59-bc7c-4a55-8a9b-83719ce76888.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3bbb41e5-db06-4ed8-8eca-2e0dfb0b7ab5.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05a27e7a-dcfa-4d66-9627-4fe6fd954fc2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3053fba-d597-4348-9fc7-317c37457fd8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dafa37ab-efd7-4405-b8a6-3e5f33249249.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4528db38-c964-4e86-b1d2-2b814111dff5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4d3b5365-79fd-46cc-a423-059b2a2b93dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5080922c-75ab-4829-bb52-ca1e4b2923d7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3a8ef723-218d-49da-87e4-edc947a4368d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"77096bc1-e4ab-4541-a124-4a1b3f50732c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a9e27415-ad5e-4e13-bb8e-71518dc7b536.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d09a7a95-fee0-4f42-947d-d32712928fd1.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bded4395-2a33-44a9-83e2-2219f6d7379d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c20b162c-0d2e-4428-925c-86ec8cee3836.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Beyond Good & Evil","Overview":"The planet of Hyllis has fallen under siege by a ruthless alien race.

Melee","Overview":"Super Smash Bros. Melee differs from traditional fighting games in that inflicting the most damage does not guarantee victory. Instead, opposing players must force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ORQ4sWskyaM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee"},"5764":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"The Behemoth","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Platform; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a992d9af-e0f4-4169-90b7-3677df0c0593.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d5ab0bec-3d62-46b1-b20a-cfb6c000f218.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6bc0c38d-2c59-4f23-9737-0a1eddcc33fa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fb0d2322-2260-45c4-8685-82232707ab74.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46ba0d44-4cf5-44ae-835b-c7ddf187fee0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1b1a759e-6dd3-4d8b-a65e-193ebc23e7f6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc99b88d-5e31-40b5-9034-113ad4d6305c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ddcd052a-598b-4674-9b3d-2a61945c8bb5.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07b8553c-fba8-4f49-b31c-a3f9ab0af1bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f5362de2-c6ff-4412-a3f1-431607286b96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df272cc1-5a91-4cb2-882a-f7ec00c7dbc4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Alien Hominid","Overview":"You're a little yellow alien. The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth. And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep. After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?\n\nAlien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.\n\nTo help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.\n\nThe GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot). The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special \"PDA Game\" with very simple-looking graphics. Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit. Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.","Publisher":"O3 Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/jYI8CJCPybU"},"5765":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acclaim","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"5ce2a896-a88d-4870-91e8-e5f99233dba6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0a0e40af-aa0f-4f59-ab53-51adc5c59193.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"689ad501-5608-4259-a8ff-2d702c20741d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e26f604-e173-40ea-a3a6-25291282ff33.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b6f47f72-b571-4a3d-a583-d0aa08b9ed57.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d50bdd34-96e8-417d-9eb6-5c7bd7d85d46.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"All-Star Baseball 2002","Overview":"All-Star Baseball 2002 has the complete 2001-2002 MLBPA rosters.

It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baten_Kaitos_Origins"},"5833":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eurocom","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"338acac4-9634-41e6-85e0-88c3d51ac3e3.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"76866334-8f61-4eee-b67a-1e33b4d7b613.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c2623d03-aac2-4b8d-a1ae-733fe7d57196.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ecd5b790-03c3-4a89-8617-767e1f25c9ce.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4a342e94-3dea-41c3-9d17-7bd700a3c4e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee2c387b-0e6b-4b87-9f1c-95ba99acb84f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a81fa1dd-4a52-4daf-8ff0-ca5e3d3a18c4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"82eb43ab-7254-4dad-8cc4-82f2344b39fe.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d6486ab1-8871-4625-8b50-e4f2e9fee6ab.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"790007e2-54c0-4902-b358-20e36269280b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"407f8ad5-7280-44cb-82ec-990b66c55524.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aeaed192-ea3f-4661-bf58-58e6d075b894.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c768c464-b976-40de-8de5-46ed068a02f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d92a5589-cf1e-431b-a3a7-4637e3b4583c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Batman Begins","Overview":"In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored.

Dodge! And... get hit!?! Ikaruga is a cult classic vertical shoot ‘em up that features unique, polarity-switching gameplay. The game’s story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra, as he battles an enemy nation using a specially-designed fighter called the Ikaruga, which can switch between two polarities: black or white. This polarity mechanic is the game’s key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. \n\nAll enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets that are the same color as the player’s ship can be absorbed, while the opposite color will do damage. As the amount of absorbed bullets increases, so does the player’s homing laser attack. When maxed out, this special attack can be up to 10x more powerful than a standard shot. Attacks can be chained together to earn bonuses that will achieve higher scores. Ikaruga features both single-player and two-player cooperative modes.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"2003-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h__26tmbUHk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ikaruga"},"6260":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Mario Golf: Family Tour","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Camelot Software Planning","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"265005d5-5e6e-42de-bc92-694f02ec693e.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f15ffd5d-7e10-4482-8c72-5921edadae73.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fb3cf205-9356-4d6a-9381-af291107f0c0.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7cdfcc0f-597e-43f7-8f7f-5ecc40eaedc6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0c570996-4336-4da1-8a5a-b9ff558da686.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c38f8d6a-3b2d-45ef-a62a-c7a13d50cb3d.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"33ad83b8-5d8b-4fe4-950d-926cdf51749f.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eac38818-2378-482e-8e30-38460b385451.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4068e0a3-cf82-4fe0-9be2-080889ce5a7f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"af9408b1-e77f-47f9-957e-2038c6c73713.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a1b12b6-36fa-4ba7-ac41-78c4c470e9b0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"98543a44-243e-4968-950d-2219464969c4.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5cf7323-3190-40c3-8da3-012c5473dd4d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8d20438f-60a4-4892-a9c7-821477ce4528.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ccb6160e-46ec-4b07-85ca-ef1876012a3b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c3a9c94a-9fcf-4172-ab99-6a4dc15cb090.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"53a54363-5d53-42e2-835c-7938b594555e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6fab4263-b0c1-496b-b29e-b6206e6e9870.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5ac8959d-7b63-4af6-9750-2d12f84fd767.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour","Overview":"Hit the links in the Mushroom Kingdom!\n\nMario, Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong and others have tee times reserved in the Mushroom Kingdom!

Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.\n\nThe game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.\n\nEternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2002-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w5__J4JCyMg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eternal_Darkness"},"6971":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Extreme-G 3","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acclaim","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"7dd087c0-6eae-46d0-8e22-18805fff4e1d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"437c643c-49e7-44bf-a819-86bd9a8c6a73.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bf1cad70-0c92-4424-a2a7-69492053e615.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"452d1d67-ceee-4ff6-89d6-11c730a6bf3a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"586967cc-0854-43b8-a4da-7c4709963ddf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ebcad342-c8ef-4c8e-b8e1-64be30767b94.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2951da1f-4121-4ec6-88dd-b2e2018d90d5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"04cf6c61-a123-47b6-8f80-ec2b721307ff.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6c0a5fbd-9719-414b-9920-3134528ee403.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"XGIII: Extreme G Racing","Overview":"XGIII: Extreme G Racing is a futuristic racing game.

Another new feature, in what is now the primary mode of the series, is the ability to watch the game in a simplified text mode, with the ability to jump into action to turn the events still available. The points system was replaced by a less abstract currency model (with the ability to choose between Pounds, Euros or Dollars). Other game modes include Tournaments (including the creation of custom tournaments) and Challenges. By completing challenges (similar to the Global Challenges mode in World Cup 2006) the player can spend points in the Fanshop with items such as new teams, a special overhead camera, new balls from Adidas (including all original World Cup balls from 1974 to 2002), stadiums, third kits and special celebrations for created players.\n\nFinally, online gaming received a new mode: Interactive Leagues. These are online-only leagues based on the fixtures of their real counterparts (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga and Mexican 1st division).

Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches, and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you.\n\nThe main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear. You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts, and kill heavily-armed bossed. There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff, or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold, and various rescue missions.\n\nThe RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes, and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons. There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items, and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts, and Winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns.\n\nThe GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents, and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness, and caves.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"6986":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Midway","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b6062c34-3cef-4680-ae91-a32b385784fd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eceb078a-2171-4a23-ac0c-2c8d9ccd8e36.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"41126364-cdc5-4602-b97a-c6f7021f5223.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d57ca95-1dfb-4058-935a-54fdc51c5784.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"93b8c0a2-0fc1-45bf-9191-fac5bfc1e608.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2a03ad1-8eab-4b50-a69a-27ce7eb60f82.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"531d0f25-0ac9-4c3d-9902-aad768294c66.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Happy Feet","Overview":"The Happy Feet game features the voices of Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy, who reprise their roles from the movie.

Once players decide on a region, they can enter a portal and then be whisked away to a 3D world. Among the environments players explore are Jimmy's House, an Asteroid Surface, an Asteroid Interior, Yolkus Prime, and Retroland Amusement Park. Each region spans multiple levels, with the goal in each being to find a number of key items and special prizes and a shrunken head. A secondary goal in some levels is to locate friends Carl Wheezer, Cindy Vortex, Rose, Nissa, and Zachary.\n\nEnemies trying to prevent Jimmy from succeeding include giant ants and the blob-like Yokians, with villains Ooblar, Poultra, and King Goobot forming the boss encounters.

Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts. With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for \"face sculpting\" - changing the different features. All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"7017":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bob Esponja y sus Amigos: Batalla por la Isla del Volcan","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blue Tongue Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"4566f445-9dc3-4162-96ac-3364d48f36fa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a0037f8b-0e71-48ca-8834-7723afc7c2f3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4083017b-96f4-4385-9972-807424ace3d2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7f0a8495-1c17-4321-a7ff-7a4b4316e737.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5489e66c-dbae-479a-827c-967660591f82.PNG","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c412b4c-6a7b-4a5c-8c25-140426f45ddd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island","Overview":"Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island is a 3D action platformer game and sequel to Nicktoons Unite!

Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2004-02-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aEBDx_MXCN4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pitfall:_The_Lost_Expedition"},"7026":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom Production Studio 4","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8008414d-0424-43a5-a6d7-5c4bf2c6170f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f18bb625-35cd-4cba-83ed-0535fe9b6195.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c6291814-44ec-4f2f-9668-797b3ffd216c.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"905d629a-2d2a-48e4-a292-92faedb053a3.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"442fa926-3d7d-4fea-a697-bb74da3623c3.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0e06f9da-052f-4814-bd3c-1c3b444fc5b7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"373770ae-58cf-4f75-8fa9-1cdc304606bb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3ac344af-ad00-4f38-99ac-58d9e6ec6ad0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"377561dd-634e-428e-ad65-de9e649abb2d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb6d67dc-885a-4dae-b2a0-fd6d52fe5027.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e990fab-df79-4844-9728-c1f955bc5502.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7199f990-4630-4a18-a163-e13cc7a76e02.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b8d648bf-6041-4777-bca2-26a959d921ea.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c234e31f-97c3-467b-a074-ad37ea111031.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"caa4b7e4-786e-4a7f-aec7-97ca36c1e631.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"15868d3f-f328-4f7a-a0f0-db23400ff36a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bb524d27-7ba4-401c-b7bd-205e277a6e54.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4e7839c5-ec02-4ddb-8c30-367e5dd28146.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e1ff9951-28bf-4b72-8bef-f92ccc6a250d.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc8353a4-81db-4c47-ad77-a00f0e0ea1c7.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"c0a09c06-b64e-4e51-bab5-82eca72523d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"P.N.03","Overview":"Third-person action shooter from Capcom, featuring robot hunter heroine Vanessa Z.

It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year.

However, the true mastermind behind the attacks is actually the newly elected President of Venezuela, Juan Crespo. Crespo managed to get elected by advocating a strong anti-terror platform and exploiting the fear caused by the terrorist attacks (which he himself orchestrated). Crespo's plan is to discredit Saudi Arabia, then cut off the Venezuelan supply of oil to the United States, creating an oil crisis and driving up the price of oil, which he would then sell to the US on the black market at highly inflated prices. Rainbow manages to foil Crespo's plans, and ultimately assassinates President Crespo himself. Rainbow then arranges for the international media to credit the terrorists with causing Crespo's death.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2004-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"7035":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Storm Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"70032919-ab36-4bc6-9dab-fcfb0719331c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8811a41b-606f-4b5e-8a95-7e3b5f38111c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"101ddeaf-970f-4464-9f36-12d441f8cdf4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a56f036-56a6-4d20-aeb2-c7fe2a34bb4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e8d2b5e3-583f-4598-9c25-bc75d57ed50b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"dc731484-2d3a-431d-8a3f-9f0ed66eec31.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"321c69a0-7759-40b3-bba8-1fba22d1eb93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown","Overview":"Lockdown is the third Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles, this time with Red Storm Entertainment fully behind the wheel.

The game was published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to the 2002 game The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.\n\nThe game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and his 2003 film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel, The Return of the King, the third volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films.[12]\n\nThe game is similar to its predecessor in basic gameplay, but differs by adding multiple storylines, more playable characters and increased interaction with environments. A two-player co-op mode is also available for some missions. As with The Two Towers, The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with the filmmakers, using many of the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props and other assets from the film. The game was met with positive critical reception for its graphics, audio, and gameplay, although its camera positioning and short length were criticized.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2003-11-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"7061":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Las Tortugas Ninja: TMNT","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b7a50454-8a8d-4aed-b9e0-2ffcf6e0fa1f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c56f2068-787c-4dc2-8853-44d0cbf3bcc4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6037976b-edf5-41ad-af77-3db1dac927cc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"627a1be1-0985-4d81-8df6-781466a10dd6.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"482a3c1f-6c75-429b-b7bc-36a98154c62d.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"55b9e483-f7ef-4cf7-a4a9-02894e67a654.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3ffb5999-6611-474e-961a-98431dc25e15.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"2a0bbe34-8628-44b2-8dc7-d33eea1be3aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"TMNT","Overview":"Based on the newer anime styled FOX cartoon of the same name, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles features Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello as green ninjas.

You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.\n\nUnlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2003-01-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"7065":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Virtua Striker 3 Ver. 2002","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Amusement Vision","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"149e8f1d-438e-44dc-a918-f92c2c8040de.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8b54ebf6-544e-465c-ac65-de338d8a9154.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"18fe5cea-ab7c-42f1-8d00-47cf4fc6f212.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"732bb32c-bab6-47e1-9d77-97b0a7a59642.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1e01825-c086-492e-b981-2d24bb6c67e3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"caf98d72-131a-46c4-8d58-5902d1bdd8e1.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e9acfd6-8356-4ab9-956a-e18e107f1f7b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"81f9c976-ceb5-4d08-b7b3-bafe4ec801c0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fa6680db-3655-4b58-a288-403119c9ca17.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cb4dbd1f-8842-491c-a739-ac25dfb7aa51.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Virtua Striker 2002","Overview":"The Virtua Striker (バーチャストライカー in Japanese) video games are arcade-style football\/soccer sports games by Sega.

Skye of Lynlora was just a restless shepherd when she first came across the strange item that would change her life forever. Now she has opened a portal to another place and chaos has come forth. Only Skye can set things right once again. She will face an assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds. It is notable that, like some other releases from publisher Simon and Schuster (including the Boston Animation-developed M&M's: The Lost Formulas), this game features prominent product placement in the form of Skittles brand fruit-flavored candies. Indeed, it is the mystic power of Skittles that moves Skye through more than one threatening game situation. In spite of any potential incongruities of featuring a familiar consumer item in a fantasy world, Darkened Skye strives to provide the graphical competence, engrossing story, and state-of-the-art play that gamers expect from a major 2002 release. ~ T.J.

The racing game, or \"Freekstyle\" mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into \"freakout\" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.

It is a spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog series and follows Shadow the Hedgehog, a creation of Doctor Eggman's grandfather, Prof. Gerald Robotnik, as he attempts to learn about his past while suffering from amnesia. Shadow the Hedgehog introduces third-person shooter elements and nonlinear gameplay to the Sonic franchise. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks, and most levels have three possible missions that the player may choose to complete. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels. The story choice can be either Hero side or Dark side. The game is rated E-10+ for ages 10 and up. After this game, Shadow becomes an ally.\n\nhttps:\/\/sega.fandom.com\/wiki\/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)\n\nAlthough it is a 3D platform game as with the more recent Sonic Adventure games, the game's levels each feature up to three different missions (Hero, Dark, Normal) that the player may choose to complete. The game's plot depends on which mission is completed as well as subsequent playable levels. The game stars Shadow the Hedgehog and his quest to recover his memory, a goal he has been pursuing since his debut in Sonic Adventure 2, while an evil alien race known as the Black Arms is invading the planet.\nThe game received mixed reviews; it has been criticized for the addition of weapons into Sonic gameplay and other dark themes (such as swearing) although it was praised for its replay value.\n\nhttps:\/\/sonic.fandom.com\/wiki\/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(game)\n\nThe world is in peril as forces, both good and evil, make a play for the powerful Chaos Emeralds. In Shadow the Hedgehog, you can control Shadow and choose which side to fight for.

Armed with two wrist-mounted silver blades, Rayne can slice and dice would-be assailants as well as throw projectiles or use various firearms. \n\nBloodRayne's primary mission will take her to an underground temple in South America, where it is rumored an elite group is trying to unite three parts of an ancient talisman to control the world. As she fights to prevent this, BloodRayne will need to consume the blood of her victims to sustain her life and increase her power. To fight her, the supernatural enemies will plan ambushes or call for reinforcements if the odds are not in their favor.\n\nAs BloodRayne becomes more proficient at killing, her abilities will increase as well. Talents include speed, agility, vision, and the ability to slow time to attack multiple enemies at once. The amount of blood she drinks also makes her stronger, beginning with Bloodlust and culminating in Bloodrage. Cinematic cut-scenes highlight certain actions for dramatic effect as well as further the story as the operative gets closer to her goal.","Publisher":"Majesco Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"12925":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Harry Potter et le Prisonnier d'Azkaban","Region":"France"},{"Name":"Harry Potter e il Prigioniero di Azkaban","Region":"Italy"},{"Name":"Harry Potter en de gevangene van Azkaban","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"Name":"Harry Potter och fangen fran Azkaban","Region":"Sweden"},{"Name":"Harry Potter to Azkaban no Shuujin","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Electronic Arts","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a05eef4f-5e21-4f76-98d9-05ccca1bd741.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"96fa80cf-f2c5-43c7-905e-25b9e36c79ff.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"039806f7-6676-4c2e-abb7-a49e7e296d5d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0f3475f9-bf46-4bce-8d3c-5777bef1308e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7258ec6-d706-4355-a8f4-7d3cb2009d54.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5642feec-fe19-4dec-acac-379771591246.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"42e9791a-a9e6-4cbe-8543-9d7a9aee7ed5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"54d022dc-971a-4603-967d-d63c3af64356.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4fe339b2-e87f-4124-a7a4-ab5be7a1b2d5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b7b1cb87-711b-4ef0-970a-77c30c7294e6.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Overview":"Offering a host of new features and opponents, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban looks to offer fans of this series a refreshingly new storyline as Harry and friends face their most terrifying opponents yet.

The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, runs up walls and ramps, hops on a barrel to cross narrow ledges, and avoids numerous hazards while slicing at enemies. Other weapons include shurikens, swords, blowguns, rocket launchers, homing missiles, and more, with bosses and lesser villains appearing in the air, sea, and on the ground. Players will even square off against a 150-foot robot from inside a robot warrior of their own. The ultimate goal is to defeat nemesis Master O-Dor and his army of Ranx foot soldiers. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with over-the-top animations, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.\n\n\nI-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game.

The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.\n\nIn addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.\n\nThere is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to \"run around\" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.\n\nThe game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.\n\nIt is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, it is also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13647":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bunkasha Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"59b208bf-1136-4a51-a7ec-2fd58f1c03c4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1e8af31b-21bd-44fc-924c-cf55358eb4de.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ce94fa2d-2bf7-4150-97da-33d5d6be7521.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fc6f0ff8-0833-4a40-9c37-94fb75f67eb1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4db9f581-9e87-40e6-8c44-788908b991a7.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6dad62e0-3a1a-4162-8e91-ffca4cfbe9d8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c391337-f359-4fd8-bf6f-c119482f0442.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8c782d3c-da2e-4771-bb86-f05184f02237.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c7b3d431-991b-43bd-9bd9-50ec4d15132e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions","Overview":"Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions (Double S.T.E.A.L. in Japan) is a video game released on the GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2.

Since there are no limitations imposed on players, they are free to smash windows, plow through parks, and do things that would otherwise be illegal. In addition to riding across real-world locales, players can participate in side events like bus jumping, wheelies, and zipping through tunnels of fire to earn some notoriety and cash for their character. Money can then be used to purchase new equipment including bikes, clothing, accessories, and more.\n\nNine professional riders are available to play as or against, including such legends as Kris \"The Rock\" Rourke and Ronnie \"Kung Fu\" Faisst. Seven generic riders are also selectable, bringing the total lineup of characters to 16. Players must guide these characters through various skill-based challenges in order to unlock the remaining courses. Once unlocked, the eight levels seamlessly connect with one another to form one sprawling environment. Within each region are special events entitled Big Air, Freestyle, Hill Climb, and Race, which typically involve performing as many aerial stunts as possible to outscore the competition.\n\nFreestyle MetalX also features a number of sub-games to add some diversity to the racing action. Players will ride off a cliff to see how many tricks they can perform during their rapid decent, become a human dart while hurling themselves toward an enormous dartboard, and even participate in a game of motocross pinball. Those tired of the existing courses can create their own arena using the built-in level editor. No matter which mode is selected, players can listen to hard-driving music from such bands as Megadeath, Mötley Crüe, Motörhead, and Twisted Sister.","Publisher":"Midway Sports Asylum","ReleaseDate":"2003-09-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"17596":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Vicious Cycle Software","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6c9a549a-3989-41c3-ba5d-8deb8397c772.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8372137f-8d5d-47f4-9674-cbbf77b06d74.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7f90a421-f1f3-4eee-acb8-43104d6eb09f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1376a8bd-c369-496f-b64f-03a0abbcba74.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7c37793c-64cd-4b93-ab90-dfb4fb542422.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"040ae0ab-9232-4ef0-988c-983725d2513f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f0bd36c6-53cb-4bfe-8f48-3efde065ca31.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"32646537-e162-4b45-a61c-4ee660d4ef37.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"398440d9-7204-4bd1-acd5-65e252555042.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d9fb1a5a-9ef2-4be4-b3a1-d39adcdc2649.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cedbe549-6831-4940-ba56-7674feb0f6a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Robotech: Battlecry","Overview":"The game follows the exploits of ace pilot Jack Archer.

This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.\n\nThe game features a two-player mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2004-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puyo_Pop_Fever"},"24137":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"95506d6c-6ded-43c1-8f21-04854d6287df.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d250dd4c-dbe9-4d74-b536-75c7dd65c142.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e1eda1bf-8ee8-437d-a339-220642915b5c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9a794fb-3c3e-487e-8ef9-9a818c169434.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"72a75918-3008-483e-b1f5-743fa289c593.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"40a9d58d-e281-4c2c-91ad-53250afc7fa4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon","Overview":"The year is 2008, and Russian rebels have taken over Moscow in an attempt to restore the old communist regime.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.\n\nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.\n\nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.\n\nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.\n\nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.\n\nKnockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.\n\nAfter Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30699":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pro Rally 2002","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"69c4cb0a-e03b-4ff9-88ec-99635c8456d4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"62e990f4-6e3b-4e7f-9ede-6c57e2039c1e.png","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ced7d052-eb84-484e-a428-37373996adc6.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"210a6711-47cc-4c5b-8f18-3b213ce12926.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bcc519fa-2d72-43bb-bdd8-cae223545e42.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"601ac256-0884-4078-afe4-469df25e4fcd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a55d2acb-04f2-46e3-84bd-7f5e0bb437ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pro Rally","Overview":"Pro Rally 2002, or simply Pro Rally on the GameCube, is a video game of the racing genre released in 2002 by Ubisoft.

Eddy is the fearless leader, eager to make a quick buck; Ed is the tall, strong and stupid one, while Edd (or Double-Dee) is the smart, polite neat-freak, who communicates with his family through sticky notes.\n\nEd, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures allows you to play as the trio through a series of levels, called 'scams'. Each level is a get-rich-quick scheme dreamed up by Eddy, allowing the Eds to get some jawbreakers. Each level can be accessed via the hub world, the 'Cul-de-sac', where the Eds have their adventures and meet other neighborhood kids.\n\nPlayers control all three Eds; more specifically, they're always in control of an Ed, and the other two tag along. You can switch your Ed at any time with the press of a button. Each Ed has their own abilities: Eddy can hurl stink bombs and form a tower to reach high objects, Ed can dig in sandpits, lift and throw objects, and charge at things to smash them, while Double Dee can use his slingshot, activate machines, and be thrown high into the air by the other two Eds.\n\nEd, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures is a 3D platform video game based on the Cartoon Network animated television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and Cartoon Network Interactive and published by Midway Games. The game's plot is loosely structured around six different stories with two bonus levels, each involving a scam by the titular trio to acquire enough money to buy jawbreakers, a plot that mirrors that of the animated series. Players may choose at any point to take control of Ed, Edd, or Eddy to overcome the game's obstacles. Character selection is strategical due to each of the Eds having his own unique ability. Throughout the game, the player encounters not only the Ed trio but also the series' side characters, such as Jimmy, Sarah, Kevin, Jonny, and the Kanker sisters.\n\nIt was announced on February 15, 2005, and released on November 3, 2005, for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nhttps:\/\/ed.fandom.com\/wiki\/Ed,_Edd_n_Eddy_-_The_Mis-Edventures","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/yymDECDU2Xs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ed,_Edd_n_Eddy:_The_Mis-Edventures"},"30820":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Hyper Sports 2002 Winter","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e5a197c0-17f4-4608-91e9-1240f976150b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"63104753-108f-493d-8b2c-bebf48bc7f93.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a574dcdc-336f-4919-9ca9-c2338ca2ec49.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0c7ea64c-fa45-4d37-a245-e3dcfcae26a5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4c1a55e5-ba45-4b00-b128-bc983cf5e595.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0965d33-5d36-452a-a4f2-9e0bf2a532e2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bee33a9b-a1d0-4eba-9f24-c1209b4e654a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"030f21fc-6e4e-4bf6-9bb5-fd3c5ec79b40.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d297aa92-4b33-4693-bbaf-9acdab1afd18.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"ESPN International Winter Sports 2002","Overview":"ESPN International Winter Sports 2002 is a sports video game released in 2002 by Konami.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30821":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b250fcbd-dbc0-456c-8d2a-22a4dacf7246.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"22fa3c98-328e-45df-8a74-0a96297c3ca1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b2120444-5343-426f-a12c-1845b65af2bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"616a2ad4-7356-42fc-9cd2-7cd07505ccb0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"13fb0915-9913-4155-90dd-2530ee2a2582.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a90dedbb-7eef-4a6f-ae81-d0347ea7988e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1b656e31-dcf4-48d3-90a4-8600c54f72bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002","Overview":"ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002 sets the new standard for soccer games with more fluid animations, better player control and greater depth than ever before.

One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's \"Freestyle Control\" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of some of the more well-known players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses.\n\nThe European cover features Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids, representing Brazil, Manchester United and Juventus respectively. In the United States, Landon Donovan appeared in Roberto Carlos' place.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2002-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30828":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"FIFA Football 2004","Region":"France"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Canada","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b4407a98-3eb6-4de9-98a7-55ac5b76c77b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"856dc4fa-426c-44ee-8a39-395d4969fe33.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c0d04f8d-c4ea-48d7-a607-538a0f91402e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c80923e6-6351-4be0-9801-c755ae285b11.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bfd4eace-64c1-4f09-821b-7f73560af37d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f10f690e-c540-445e-8326-aae17d1c44f7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6501b49b-2365-458f-b6ec-3e12643cfece.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"FIFA Soccer 2004","Overview":"FIFA Football 2004, also known as FIFA Soccer 2004 in North America, is a football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts.

However, in Fire Blade, the player is forced to be far less cautious unless on a stealth mission and is usually pitted against far larger amounts of enemies. The main element of the game is aggressively piloting the player's attack helicopters against large enemy armored formations and completing the main mission objectives, these vary in creativity from simply blowing up a bridge to aiding a special forces team in stopping a train by parking a truck across the tracks and stopping enemy troops from moving it.\n\nA secondary element of the game is FPS-style sniping, when the player's helicopter enters \"stealth mode\" the autocannon is used as a precision sniper weapon that can be used to accurately target individual soldiers, allowing the player to snipe enemy infantry much like in an FPS.\n\nAdditional fuel and ammunition for the helicopter's jet boosters and heavier armaments are acquired from destroyed enemy vehicles instead of the more conventional reloading areas from games such as the Strike Series.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2002-12-29T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30843":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Midway","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"1602bce8-563b-43df-848b-b34e4c53d776.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"002a580c-2633-475c-8c74-67953289804a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5cfe2df9-83b5-4353-a855-faa4e80ace21.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9e430766-e25d-4c46-8488-73fb6ff67472.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"297913df-dcee-44f5-a459-7b2718177028.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bdba5430-fa76-4a4e-9682-9603e6f8b15f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4813c043-61c8-42bd-8f9b-ba3d7a343861.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a0e29065-2e9b-493f-8514-ce9f885078f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Freaky Flyers","Overview":"This cartoon style racing game replaces the usual kart formula with planes (and all sorts of flying technology, such as UFO's, flying carpets and plenty more).\n\nChoose from one of the many different, and wacky, characters and take to the sky over various locations, each with its own set of obstacles and shortcuts.

Designed more as a pick-up-and-play game than a detailed simulation, it offers fast-paced gameplay and a basic selection of modes.\n\nModes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Home Run Derby. The game features team customization and player creation and trading. Players will control all aspects of play: pitching, batting, fielding and running.\n\nThe pitching interface features a pitch type selector that displays the pitches available to the current player as lines whose length indicates their effectiveness. Pitches are selected by moving the control stick in the appropriate direction, and then pressing the appropriate button for normal, slow or fast pitches or pick-off throws. A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for best results.\n\nThe batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts as well as normal, power and contact swings are possible.\n\nDuring fielding, an icon indicates the ball's height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal. Running is otherwise automatic, with only the destination base selectable.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30856":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Disney-Pixar Mr. Incredible: Kyouteki Underminder Toujou","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Disney-Pixar The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer"},{"Name":"Mr. Incredible: Kyouteki Underminder Toujou","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Los Increibles: La Amenaza del Socavador","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Heavy Iron Studios","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5a55f56f-8579-4200-a4c7-c32da6466815.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7a0b7438-2782-454c-aeac-e99653b9d935.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c47bf9b6-b782-4298-b3cc-1819c52014f0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7464b0b7-cfa1-4698-995d-211d5d2bc1bf.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7b5d0dd1-6fe9-4963-9c1a-7042ab49106f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1615af67-0f98-4b05-9dfd-aa1076da52b7.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"228971f4-0ef4-4c4b-acbd-88fca50458d4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0ca04699-e9b1-4432-a598-fa43cd2ce443.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"794d40a3-33d3-4b65-b0f0-897829a40fdb.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer","Overview":"When the evil Underminer rises to the surface with a sinister plan to rule the world, it's up to Mr. Incredible and his super cool pal Frozone to save the day.

The version by Asobo Studio is, like other versions, a 3D platform game, but has its own design, levels and missions.\n\nThe game follows the plot of the film only loosely, but has the main voice cast from the movie reprising their roles. The player controls Remy, a rat with a refined sense of taste. When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.\n\nWhile many of the environments in the game are similar to those in the next-generation version, this version has almost none of the open world elements seen in the other title, with smaller levels and mostly linear progress. To get around in the various levels that include the sewers, streets and rooftops of Paris, the restaurant kitchen and a food market, Remy can jump and double-jump, swing along poles, balance on ropes, crawl on certain walls and defend himself with tail swipes or by using spoons as weapons. He can also engage his keen sense of smell, which displays the path to the next goal or objective. Sometimes, Remy must evade guards by hiding out of sight until their attention wanes. Other sequences in the levels involve sliding down pipes, rafting through water currents and fleeing from humans that chase Remy. Another large part are mini-games, many of which involve cooking, with Remy having to pick ingredients or peel potatoes.\n\nThere are some optional bonus missions, taking the form of dream sequences, in which Remy navigates landscapes made of foodstuffs. All levels include many collectibles. In most levels there will be up to 100 stars to collect. Special items in certain levels include batteries, darts or lightbulbs. Collecting all of a certain kind of item in an area awards bonus points, which can be spent in Gusteau's shop to unlock bonuses, including various kinds of artwork as well as the possibility to play the mini-games outside the main game, in both single and multiplayer modes.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2007-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30903":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Groove Adventure Rave: Fighting Live","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"608486bd-9bd1-4da1-b1c2-7b53502f899e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ce2ccc91-c2a1-4265-84a8-c30796f3e907.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"afa8e095-0bbf-45e2-8862-2f3fc07e9f63.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07d05743-0dba-44dd-8c20-275c6102713c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2ec58be5-0be9-4e53-b00f-f9b336880b93.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"230983db-b0f6-47a9-8c55-165028334270.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aab67447-7623-42a9-bbb6-a20f74dc5803.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8c1f8f4d-07f2-4c39-9778-3a20c47040f7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Rave Master","Overview":"Rave Master, titled Rave (レイヴ Reivu?, romanized as RAVE) in Japan and also known there as The Groove Adventure Rave, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima. The series follows Haru Glory, a teenager in a quest to find the five pieces of the sacred stone Rave in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length.\n\nThe manga was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from July 1999 through July 2005, and published in thirty-five tankōbon volumes by Kodansha. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series by Studio Deen. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the Toonami programming block, and re-broadcast on Syfy in 2009.\n\nThe manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version resulting in uninteresting and confusing dialogues as well as unappealing music.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30904":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Point of View, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"831dbc47-34e1-4ccc-baab-676ce2be3089.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"24890428-bfe7-475b-ab98-2a1d8b4487ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8df68022-8ef5-4d4a-805d-e52f1c1c25da.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fbbaeb89-8ab7-4dc2-a9b1-4c632f845d58.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7ac69bb4-5871-436c-9b64-70b79ee017db.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a983d907-1a44-439e-be6d-a6eae95aea1e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"602fd90f-da51-4ca3-8168-bcd66dfc3a5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"RedCard 2003","Overview":"Redcard 20-03 shows why soccer really is a contact sport with over-the-top kicks, scores, celebrations, and tackles.

It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims.[1]\n\nThe game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters.\n\nThe Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Apple Mac OS X was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009.[2][3]\n\nThe Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.[4] During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold.[5] The Sims 2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.[6][7] As of March 2012, The Sims 2 has sold at least six million PC copies and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all-time.[8]","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30912":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Climax Group","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"e2689991-83c7-493e-a0dc-1039ae183708.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2c865b8d-39c8-41ad-86b9-2b41d8f8ecbf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e4576083-e932-437d-bce1-c1e79038c61f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9cbbe8ab-fd95-48d8-a57c-8994e754830d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5fb4467c-fb52-4e91-ae38-f4e1a9a89d76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Speed Kings","Overview":"It will take nerves of steel and lightning-fast reflexes to make your way through the crowded streets of Speed Kings.

Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen.

The events consist of swimming, racing, climbing ropes, and other endurance challenges.\n\nTak is the magic user while Lok is the brawn. During the game, the two characters provide comical banter with each other. Tak can use a chicken suit to fly and a lobster suit to swim underwater. The cutscenes are in real time. Taloc, the bad guy from the previous games, is nowhere to be found as the game now focuses on the Juju challenge and not on trying to defeat the bad guy.

While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.). There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident.

The Mac version was developed and published by Feral Interactive.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble\/Bust-a-Move, but with several key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an \"arch\", allowing players to reach difficult areas.\n\nShooting blocks will have one of two effects:\n\nIf the player hits a block that is either the same colour as the bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up was the coloured blocks that were just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.\nIf the player hits a block that is a different colour from the bazooka missile, or is a \"dead block\" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.\n(Weapons are affected differently by other blocks.

The heroes return to Alkali Lake to recover two stolen Cerebro parts, and find out that an unknown organization is doing a salvage operation on the base. What they uncover reveals to be a threat to all mutants...\n\nThe three playable characters have distinct fighting abilities. Wolverine fights from a fixed third-person view; the player essentially has to \"button mash\" his way through hordes of soldiers and classic X-Men villains as Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike. Iceman can fly; his abilities are widely used when he traverses the ice bridge to fly out and save places such as a nuclear power plant and the Statue of Liberty. As Nightcrawler, the player views the world from a free third-person perspective; he possesses a teleportation ability, which allows him to drop on his enemies while getting the missing Cerebro parts and saving the Brooklyn Bridge from Mirror Man.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2006-05-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YGm1MK_T5UQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-Men:_The_Official_Game"},"30941":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Asterix & Obelix XXL","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Étranges Libellules","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c4372b67-891b-46d4-b740-0c33a8014223.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1933e739-1f6c-4d66-90e0-eb7b7b7e5762.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7673bf45-8440-46e1-9eca-7f5bb512f7e6.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5caf559e-c162-45e8-a4ce-bff33fc3bbd9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"63b87629-6249-4c25-81d5-0615b6b03fa8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e47b7956-080e-49dd-8fd7-3ebaaf6477e6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c640e07e-234d-43cd-8dfa-2d5fcceea9e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Astérix & Obélix XXL","Overview":"Asterix & Obelix XXL is an action adventure video game released in 2004.

The game allows you access to over 80 tunable vehicles from ten different Japanese manufacturers. Many of these cars are locked and must be obtained by playing through the game. In addition, there are several modes of play to use them on, which are Championship, Quick Race, Time Attack, Versus, and Drift-Combo.\n\nA fairly standard staple in the racing genre, the Championship is a rather straight forward career mode. In this mode, you have four classes ranging from Beginner to Professional. Beginner is free to get in, but the next three classes require you to finish the previous class and then acquire a license by passing a series of driving tests. Certain races in each class have limits on what cars can be entered, forcing you to mix things up a bit and develop different strategies.\n\nQuick Race is good if you just want to jump into the game and start. You can use any parts, cars and tracks you've unlocked so far from the Championship mode.\n\nTime Attack is a time trial mode where the object is to get the best time you can with the car and track you choose.\n\nVersus is the game's multiplayer mode. Two to four players can battle it out with any unlocked cars and tracks.\n\nDrift-Combo is a challenging mode that scores you based one how well you can drift on a selection of three drift courses. Connecting drifts raises your score and subsequently, your ranking on the board.\n\nThe Wii version is bundled with a steering wheel.","Publisher":"MTO","ReleaseDate":"2003-06-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l9bTioFPhjc"},"33982":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Zoids Vs.","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"88335fc2-09d1-4457-bd33-93f830cf12e1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f677d06a-e882-4351-b215-3cf50e828097.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0e44930d-3c7d-4e0b-96ab-01893586483b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef7cbad1-149d-4f4c-9086-d4e1e077f2e0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"20a5af8e-3f29-4ad7-9517-f4bde84134a4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8b366d9c-6ec2-4442-9f2c-dd4e11352774.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c9a26601-affa-4d46-a3e8-4b265803e75a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e2a434d2-eb36-45d6-b51f-931bc5078d4b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Zoids Vs.","Overview":"Zoids Vs. is an Action game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 2002.","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Zoids_video_games#Zoids_VS_(GameCube)"},"33983":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"805f4a65-65a6-4302-8895-6f406873efbb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3e888e29-a072-413b-b9e7-87f7f9ef3111.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Zoids Vs.

In online mode, the player can assume the role of gamemaster and create an online game for up to thirty-five other players.\n\nAn innovative multiplayer online role playing game for GameCube, developed by Chunsoft. The game ships on two discs, one designed as a standalone single-player quest, the other containing a unique online version of the title. Taking a cue from the setup of the classic pen-and-paper RPG Dungeons & Dragons, the online portion of Homeland has one player act as the dungeon master game leader.

The game features an arcade mode with five stages, a score attack mode, scalable difficulty, and bonus modes depending on the platform. The story follows a blue-haired schoolgirl named Shizuru Kamigusa, who is allergic to radio waves. Her father works for a company developing a remedy for the condition, but a terrorist group led by Ruki Michima takes over their building. Shizuru mans a flying mecha called a “terminal suit\" to save her father and the medicine from the terrorists. Dialog appears on the playfield throughout the game and can be dismissed by pressing a button, although this feature can be disabled.\nThe game features bullet hell gameplay elements, providing the player with a small hit box and swarms of particles to evade. Most of the bullets come in patternless waves with the exception for the mini-bosses and stage bosses which feature more regular patterns. The player may choose from three different ships each with a different spead setting, and may also choose from three different weapons: spread gun, homing laser, and bubble cannon. Each of these weapons features different ranges and speeds, so the player must utilize different strategies with them. They can also be powered up throughout the game. Once the game is started, the player is equipped with their main weapon, sword, and shield. The short-range sword can be used to destroy the same bullets and enemies the guns can destroy, but can also deflect items. This deflection mechanic allows the player to \"juggle\" items and power-ups until they are desired. When not firing, the terminal suit will automatically deploy a shield which can be used to deflect certain enemy bullets. A combo bar, which determines the score multiplier, can be increased by either using the shield to harvest energy from bullets or enemies or using the ABSNET shield, a weapon similar to Giga Wing or Mars Matrix which eliminates all minor enemies and projectiles on the screen.

The only North American version available was released for the Xbox while the PAL region versions were released on all consoles except for Game Boy Advance. A Japan-only version was released on GameCube. This was the last game Titus Software developed before going bankrupt in 2005.\n\nThe game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence.\n\nThe game received mostly negative reviews by critics. GameSpot rated it 2.2\/10, the official Xbox Magazine UK rated it a mediocre 5.9\/10, GamerFeed gave it a 2\/5, Xbox Magazine gave 2\/10, and NTSC UK rated it 3\/10.[19] The Scandinavian magazine Gamereactor gave the game 1\/10 and called it \"the worst videogame since Superman 64\" (also from Titus Software).","Publisher":"MGM Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2004-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_RoboCop_video_games#RoboCop_3"},"95263":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"e83ae5ae-131d-49d6-b31b-2ea3233c7aec.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7faa0028-ee5a-40e1-bef6-8e4f4fa927b8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4db0899-b852-4198-9b68-f4240aaf724d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1a1560ff-9b27-48d4-b628-074c09709774.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b160ac11-6133-401d-99d3-b92b4ea2a899.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Shaman King: Soul Fight","Overview":"Shaman King: Soul Fight! is a 2003 cel-shaded fighting game with turn-based strategy elements for the Nintendo Gamecube developed by Tuning Electronic, and published by Bandai. It is based upon the anime and manga Shaman King, written by Hiroyuki Takei. It follows the journey of Yoh Asakura and his friends in the quest to become Shaman King. There are 26 characters and five game modes to choose from: \"Story Mode\", \"Shaman Fight Mode\", \"Tutorial Mode\", \"Shaman King Mode\" and \"Omake Mode\". Soul Fight is one of the only console games developed by Tuning Electronic, a company which has developed a small number of low-budget arcade games.\nThis game sold well in Japan and even gained a \"Bandai The Best\" version, but never made it to the US due to Konami securing exclusivity rights to video games for the franchise in the west.\nPlayers may choose from a cast of 20+ characters featured in the series to do battle. Fighting is essentially a game of rock-paper-scissors. Characters have 3 different attacks with attributes that may be customized to their liking. Attacks are chosen and played out on-screen by the characters who are indirectly controlled. Successful attacks build a crystal meter to launch cinematic specials that come in three levels, each a step up in strength from the last. The game also features a lengthy fully voiced story mode that follows the anime and a character training mode. There are a variety of unlockables, including much of the playable cast as hidden characters.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shaman_King:_Soul_Fight"},"95264":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"b646930b-52b5-42e5-bae4-dc1a8ca81ed6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"afa46e51-d484-4820-abf8-61686500b163.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"85c4e632-533d-4e4d-9abd-3bf18d6f88a0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5b78953f-270b-4b48-86cf-28281401ebab.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c404fdd-93fb-43fa-acbd-21c6abfa388e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6d8d77e8-7b1e-464d-94c3-e43e3a66bd34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Shinseiki GPX Cyber Formula: Road to the Evolution","Overview":"Shinseiki GPX Cyber Formula: Road to the Evolution is a Racing game, developed by Atelier-Sai and published by Sunrise Interactive, which was released in Japan in 2004.","Publisher":"Sunrise Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2004-07-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"95265":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"efb5da25-867b-4537-b521-7c52f58a286f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"db2ed690-e633-4ce8-a9b2-477c43eed9e3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8bbd7577-3310-4564-9b64-7ad4e70f4998.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"422cf514-5138-44ec-b628-2948eebd6d1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Speed Challenge: Jacques Villeneuve's Racing Vision","Overview":"Take part in the first Virtual Championship on the racetrack of the future!

This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's FIFA Manager.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-02-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"95270":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Saffire","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"bd3ff2b8-2ca6-45cd-a7a6-2438af545ee6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7021b58a-bf2c-4b4c-a31a-96550e479de7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08eafdeb-b93a-4f59-b60e-83058da0bdd2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b0140529-0531-43b2-8c9a-ebb2ea4a4d48.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"Name":"Warrior Blade: Rastan vs. Barbarian","Overview":"Barbarian blends the intensity of a fighting game with the deep storytelling of a role-playing game.

Inspired by his cinema hero, Joe goes through levels by beating assorted goons and solving simple puzzles. Punches and kicks are the mainstay of Joe's assault but special powers are in the wings consisting of slow-down, mach-speed and zoom. The first two powers affect the physics of the game while zoom blows out a local ground attack on close foes.\n\nAs if Kids Mode wasn't easy enough, Capcom introduces a \"Sweet Mode\" in the re-release of Viewtiful Joe. Apparently geared towards the kindergarten set, Viewtiful Joe Revival offers a difficulty level below that of Kids Mode at a friendly price of ¥3980. Hard charging players will still be able to play the other difficulty levels if they wish.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2003,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viewtiful_Joe"},"176446":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ohenro-San: Hosshin no Dojo Hen","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"86b3f4ef-1d2a-497f-af8e-e736b7a2b82b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e79055f5-f330-4c0b-a899-682cf2409eba.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"93124b93-a4a9-4fad-a9e8-cb07676a1dd7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ohenro-San: Hosshin no Dojo","Overview":"Ohenro-San: Hosshin no Dojo is based on the Ohenro pilgrimage, a 1,400 kilometer journey around the 88 temples of Shikoku region of japan.
