{"Name":"Nintendo GameCube","Games":[{"DatabaseID":5427,"Name":"007: Agent Under Fire","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...\n\nThe game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KBZmx3UJjo","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"EA Redwood Shores","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"c74cebf2-aaca-4606-805f-112d4a7eca74.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"a8a16727-8fe2-486a-83fb-9638c5b51463.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"770e0b6a-ce9c-47a3-88fa-4ed966cd8854.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"546890a4-620c-42a1-80f2-5b67e71de0cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"f4f78d21-47fb-4bc0-99cf-801901e19eec.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"1d46be15-e00d-4914-99e1-c0472c86cbaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"57cac130-76e1-4bc0-9eaa-b4ea980acfc0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"e6810ab3-9467-4294-8e99-f07f134fcba5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"42940dea-fdd3-4c65-baa8-7cbc04b75e6e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"8a094253-1404-49f5-9016-aa2d0fbe9cff.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"0cf4cd91-5bfc-4180-b327-081a87f50624.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"57e3718d-295f-4639-8d3e-88a1626de551.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"4b7042c6-d846-4929-8598-29c7b32581c2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"f0604a85-175e-4e9a-a270-3355da6c1bf1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"90133609-5050-438b-bbc2-813c62733af3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"01f0f51a-0a49-483b-a079-b81aefcd9393.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"85299c14-3a7b-4a5f-91f5-41729e17c9ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"b30a1a8e-9f05-45a9-a1f3-5d9e53bce3ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"6a31e5ca-7162-4e49-9b26-319a4d2cf9b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"FileName":"ab7afbf6-d682-4f3f-b449-7e50f5d4ccc2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5427,"AlternateName":"007 - Espion pour Cible","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":5427,"AlternateName":"007: Agent im Kreuzfeuer","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":9868,"Name":"007: Everything or Nothing","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A nanobot has been stolen from the work of a world renowned scientist, Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology by a man known only as \"the General\", and has kidnapped the girl as well. James Bond races to rescue both the scientist and to retake the nanobots, and kills the General along with the nanobot samples. Bond returns Kataya to a nearby base, but it turns out the scientist has not been so faithful to Oxford. Katya meets up with Nikolai Diavolo, and gives him a hidden vial of the nanobots. Before long Bond is yet again called into action when MI6 loses contact with 003. And so Bond is off to Peru...\n\nEverything or Nothing is the second of the James Bond third-person shooters, after Tomorrow Never Dies for the Playstation. The game features new guns and a new and improved aiming system which allows you to strategically hug walls and fire around or crouch behind cover. New gadgets allow Bond to go invisible, disrupt electronics, or control mechanical spiders which allow him to access new areas. Everything or Nothing is also the first game where Pierce Brosnan actually supplies his voice for the likeness of his character, as well as many other such as Judi Dench and John Cleese.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyBLfDPBSjE","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"EA Redwood Shores","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2004-02-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"e421bec1-7cf9-4e42-8d4b-13408836b485.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"63bf3241-a8bd-46d7-af02-15ed5fc1ec1f.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"c637e74f-9b79-41da-a762-7c39d90b3d15.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"13415eac-3b13-402d-9231-f14b9a3316c4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"056e60a9-220b-4afc-b396-46e80bd81d74.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"be7465cd-d1e9-44f7-84ed-2e4c84f76b19.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"c37a01e5-3d96-4a04-a4cc-d7cee7033dcb.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"5049e2ba-f6c3-4b9b-b305-82801cbd5118.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"b5c8de80-f52a-43a3-8119-72abdefd70b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"2fdde8d7-fdd5-4992-8d2a-610dad1dbcce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"b5aae884-d071-4787-af2c-112b148e9c63.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"746392d9-a660-47f3-bb88-50addc34631a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"9bd50c47-8b10-4de8-a072-85b50e895ffa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"9de87e85-1de4-441d-88ad-4424e070c5cf.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"16a63ac3-3dd2-409b-b342-7e1a5ef4c98b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"4525df97-2afd-4fac-80de-3a814884961b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"2426fe58-464d-4f87-a24a-6771a197dd81.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"770551a4-e6e1-47a4-97d5-38626804f0aa.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"b85cb61a-91e5-4f7b-9ab7-1bfb47c8b9ee.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"99b8a7ad-0a37-4bbc-a3b3-798f56d757e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"d89f37e7-13c7-4131-bca7-fb3130bf00ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"8a509b6f-b1f9-4d16-a3e9-3ac4f3904f4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"8ea735ea-a7c2-4620-98d4-2fe0edd9aceb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"9b9cd4a2-9550-41ff-824d-94b29dd03838.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"f88b5c96-05a6-45db-83b3-970736505909.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"ea343761-51d4-40ae-807b-abdf9c5269f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"FileName":"7eb753fa-6b8f-4625-8ac5-1a1b54df9cd7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9868,"AlternateName":"007: Quitte ou Double","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"AlternateName":"007: Alles oder Nichts","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":9868,"AlternateName":"007: Todo o Nada","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":6981,"Name":"007: From Russia with Love","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From Russia with Love is a video game featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond.

The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth. And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep. After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?\n\nAlien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.\n\nTo help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.\n\nThe GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot). The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special \"PDA Game\" with very simple-looking graphics. Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit. Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/jYI8CJCPybU","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform; Shooter","Developer":"The Behemoth","Publisher":"O3 Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"a992d9af-e0f4-4169-90b7-3677df0c0593.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"d5ab0bec-3d62-46b1-b20a-cfb6c000f218.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"6bc0c38d-2c59-4f23-9737-0a1eddcc33fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"fb0d2322-2260-45c4-8685-82232707ab74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"1b1a759e-6dd3-4d8b-a65e-193ebc23e7f6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"46ba0d44-4cf5-44ae-835b-c7ddf187fee0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"cc99b88d-5e31-40b5-9034-113ad4d6305c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"ddcd052a-598b-4674-9b3d-2a61945c8bb5.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"07b8553c-fba8-4f49-b31c-a3f9ab0af1bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"f5362de2-c6ff-4412-a3f1-431607286b96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5764,"FileName":"df272cc1-5a91-4cb2-882a-f7ec00c7dbc4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5765,"Name":"All-Star Baseball 2002","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"All-Star Baseball 2002 has the complete 2001-2002 MLBPA rosters.

It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Tri-crescendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"ba383ce1-1981-463f-bb3b-f55f61a0262a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"ee3d0127-5d9a-4499-b784-d5ead1022c65.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"252fef67-f2ca-476a-b3e6-5503035f9e7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"5db0ccde-2ebc-4fa0-b1e6-9eed3c34352e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"3ce70768-cf34-4650-8115-8263d5354487.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"a77d7d3b-1f41-4349-af11-55614cf1f04d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"2587bca6-5b55-47f7-9c73-77e881b05397.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"f5716a7a-0e6e-4ead-b338-b6baad13aab3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"be4b2fe6-6393-4586-ab84-4df330be8672.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"31a7b522-b067-42b7-a312-35add3a399dd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"ac366b27-961f-4e3f-9893-7eef6cd5bf68.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"446b1831-0313-4175-b594-299b0734033a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"e44b9815-4b09-4868-bba2-b8960307eb25.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"b034b379-6e99-489c-ac79-1f927c3533df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"b5666dcc-4a75-44c5-be4e-c907f3f93a60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"4a2be3bd-89fe-4ed2-bb5a-61a79701b1ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"f0bdbdbd-1ed5-452f-94a1-cca56d5b03f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"362f37ed-ad99-485b-97ed-e2075a90a338.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"c6424b3e-b5ac-4278-bb2c-846bd3a92c3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"FileName":"1b6f4060-6e74-4265-b6b2-e44c41de2823.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5832,"AlternateName":"Baten Kaitos II: Hajimari no Tsubasa to Kamigami no Shishi","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5832,"AlternateName":"Baten Kaitos Origins","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":5831,"Name":"Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The existence of Earth, a planet of continents surrounded by deep oceans, has long become a mere legend.

The game features 19 stages, 40 minutes of rendered cinematics, and plenty of Bat gadgets, like batarangs, batgrapples, flash bombs, remote charges, batcuffs, nets, the batlauncher, batscope and more.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/Q26vlLXb1p4","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2001-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"f0fb5208-0df7-4e7a-a50e-db4066bd2d96.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"d3054a49-0d4a-4e43-9b51-f68b69277b44.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"e50a2a6d-d462-4391-a043-4904e44832b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"5ccd1442-5e72-453b-91ce-78df85a9ae46.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"b54fcd8b-89d6-4abe-9a22-d26ab499d57d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"04293c87-f551-45ff-aa4d-68c9f6c64e8e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"70f95bcd-27c1-4b43-86ed-b065483af0b8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"4b17b636-ee02-4c5d-bea9-49b215ef9440.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2569,"FileName":"c5bf90fc-2aae-4257-a56e-2f12209f4a50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5836,"Name":"Battalion Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A global conflict has reached a stalemate in the console version of the Game Boy Advance series Advance Wars.

On the team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper. Each soldier has different skills which improve as they kill more enemies and gain experience. This results in them doing a better or faster job (Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase).

So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).\n\nThe game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this.

Skye of Lynlora was just a restless shepherd when she first came across the strange item that would change her life forever. Now she has opened a portal to another place and chaos has come forth. Only Skye can set things right once again. She will face an assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds. It is notable that, like some other releases from publisher Simon and Schuster (including the Boston Animation-developed M&M's: The Lost Formulas), this game features prominent product placement in the form of Skittles brand fruit-flavored candies. Indeed, it is the mystic power of Skittles that moves Skye through more than one threatening game situation. In spite of any potential incongruities of featuring a familiar consumer item in a fantasy world, Darkened Skye strives to provide the graphical competence, engrossing story, and state-of-the-art play that gamers expect from a major 2002 release. ~ T.J.

The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested. As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free. After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb's crew. Fight for NY's story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters. You start off in D-Mobb's crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews, including D-Mobb's rival, Crow. You'll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for all thrown in. To aid you in fighting, you can use the environment to hurt your enemy. You can smash people into wooden/cement walls, fences, or just whack them off of a wooden pillar. Speakers, soda machines, garbage cans... All there to harm your enemy (or you). Some objects are interactive, such as flood lights, which will change the lighting of the ring once someone's been thrown into them. You have weapons at your disposal, usually a metal pipe, pool cue and broken bottle.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"AKI Corporation","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"57f76205-b021-4cb4-ba42-03be72ac6856.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"5e8c0369-654f-458b-901d-a8971ca05931.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"6f288cff-e5c5-42be-aa5e-d6904ddb8337.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"36343aad-bcf6-4792-b079-f028491cbc5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"549fe090-9bdf-46a7-823a-4a190dd4b794.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"aab5cbb3-51ff-4e94-9586-819fdc9ed8f1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"450244a0-cc7f-4212-971a-00e20e5318a8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"3d9c1cac-7d59-48cb-b1f3-05f05c27fff4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"ae40e722-016f-429f-9fd5-260a8f1ad9ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9873,"FileName":"95711fba-a2e0-49d2-9c56-6886f6192be0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30807,"Name":"Defender","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game is a remake of the arcade classic developed by Inevitable Software.

Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne.

In 2008 and 2009, the game was re-released in the New Play Control! series of revamped Nintendo GameCube titles. The Wii version of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is somewhat changed from the original GameCube version, including new levels, modifications of old levels, and traditional controls that have the player use the analog stick to move and the A button to jump, unlike the GameCube version which required the player to beat the bongos to do both. This is the first game to be rated E10 by the ESRB.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ioW9XC2fu4","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Nintendo EAD Tokyo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"c7a2eaa8-1820-431e-aade-5636591aafbb.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"d18b85f3-beec-4d96-9d3e-b2b3804b14a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"361fba7d-c4a1-4d2b-9803-9dbd424b8115.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"77e0015e-abb1-4bd3-bacd-229e7be769ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"8de841ca-5040-4269-bef7-80e574f58625.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"043f7c9e-e322-4ae2-81cb-930a9c10c16d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"b5a5c7b1-09d7-454d-a84f-9e7839ba4a7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"f3024d40-f1f4-49f1-9641-cf6dbed20747.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"6ab45057-0a8d-4ff4-91da-92ac3359d1f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"016a72cf-1776-4425-b123-772e5773a7c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"af6db75b-c447-45be-997d-5dbb91161723.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"f3ce3a66-aabb-4e2a-83b2-5266cbb35e7c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"9973957b-97e2-4b17-94b2-1cb2da513ee8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"3914698d-ff3e-48ca-9405-8f1faaa718b4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"c242d5df-ffe9-47c5-86e5-b342ef38c61b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"ea91f735-5202-4fa4-8a8f-513e21c4cfbe.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"da3c888b-6360-4776-a7fe-76bc48d655f2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"5229757f-c976-40c1-9be4-06798b883094.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"9022dc93-ef0e-43f7-ab83-5d6420b8b0ad.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"bfd14bc9-909f-4ffe-8ae6-32b4435a8240.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"8f064420-1bd8-48a0-8572-a3861a9f1cf2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2302,"FileName":"527688c5-e8ff-4f84-bc20-12c01e43cd98.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6966,"Name":"Donkey Konga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A rhythm and beat game like the popular Dance Dance Revolution game series, but instead of matching the beats with your feet you use your hands to play the bongos.

Eddy is the fearless leader, eager to make a quick buck; Ed is the tall, strong and stupid one, while Edd (or Double-Dee) is the smart, polite neat-freak, who communicates with his family through sticky notes.\n\nEd, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures allows you to play as the trio through a series of levels, called 'scams'. Each level is a get-rich-quick scheme dreamed up by Eddy, allowing the Eds to get some jawbreakers. Each level can be accessed via the hub world, the 'Cul-de-sac', where the Eds have their adventures and meet other neighborhood kids.\n\nPlayers control all three Eds; more specifically, they're always in control of an Ed, and the other two tag along. You can switch your Ed at any time with the press of a button. Each Ed has their own abilities: Eddy can hurl stink bombs and form a tower to reach high objects, Ed can dig in sandpits, lift and throw objects, and charge at things to smash them, while Double Dee can use his slingshot, activate machines, and be thrown high into the air by the other two Eds.\n\nEd, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures is a 3D platform video game based on the Cartoon Network animated television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and Cartoon Network Interactive and published by Midway Games. The game's plot is loosely structured around six different stories with two bonus levels, each involving a scam by the titular trio to acquire enough money to buy jawbreakers, a plot that mirrors that of the animated series. Players may choose at any point to take control of Ed, Edd, or Eddy to overcome the game's obstacles. Character selection is strategical due to each of the Eds having his own unique ability. Throughout the game, the player encounters not only the Ed trio but also the series' side characters, such as Jimmy, Sarah, Kevin, Jonny, and the Kanker sisters.\n\nIt was announced on February 15, 2005, and released on November 3, 2005, for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nhttps://ed.fandom.com/wiki/Ed,_Edd_n_Eddy_-_The_Mis-Edventures","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/yymDECDU2Xs","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Platform","Developer":"Artificial Mind and Movement","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"d92953c2-fb25-451a-b3fb-5102c596a72c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"a61a6f77-023f-4dbd-8f0b-f101e5ea59b0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"f41a06e1-98f6-4152-8dc7-b7f652a5ceca.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"25e8e471-963d-4b88-80c5-cfb97f558b9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"e309c22d-abc6-435c-9bb5-a185a0d9cdf5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"0fa4b70d-ce0f-40a9-800a-286a5439e246.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30818,"FileName":"735b0713-f0b7-4bd5-9740-6bf4e043d9a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20563,"Name":"Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness, you must build a tower from falling puzzle pieces to reach a balloon basket high above.

Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense. During this operation, Niobe and Ghost provide backup to another group of operatives trying to escape.\n\nWith everyone home, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves.

However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now is a crime boss in the Matrix. As Niobe and Ghost pursue them, the character that the player did not choose is captured by more henchmen.

Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"7 Studios","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"43554403-656e-4e73-8361-7c132b8d97cd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"a86da3d2-d59a-429f-b92f-ea4c9cb0c67d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"61c7dcd4-8462-465c-a422-630aa7fafb5d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"3935bcbd-3593-4edb-a159-670dfb2cab8d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"25077601-7d12-4e57-aa0c-abbf3dd5aa39.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"df9b9e9c-337c-43c3-ab8b-e99e6750f4ba.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"24e41144-935e-4e6d-abca-e3b6b7dfa183.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"99d83057-741e-448a-b184-aca23410ae2d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"d20444bc-c005-4d40-9173-4e81c4ae305d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5431,"FileName":"b0332c24-f707-4d12-8cbb-404fb7423656.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5431,"AlternateName":"4 Fantastiques, Les","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"AlternateName":"Fantastici 4, I","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":5431,"AlternateName":"I Fantastici 4","Region":"Italy"}]},{"DatabaseID":6973,"Name":"FIFA Soccer 06","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the free-kick interface so it's no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward.

Since there are no limitations imposed on players, they are free to smash windows, plow through parks, and do things that would otherwise be illegal. In addition to riding across real-world locales, players can participate in side events like bus jumping, wheelies, and zipping through tunnels of fire to earn some notoriety and cash for their character. Money can then be used to purchase new equipment including bikes, clothing, accessories, and more.\n\nNine professional riders are available to play as or against, including such legends as Kris \"The Rock\" Rourke and Ronnie \"Kung Fu\" Faisst. Seven generic riders are also selectable, bringing the total lineup of characters to 16. Players must guide these characters through various skill-based challenges in order to unlock the remaining courses. Once unlocked, the eight levels seamlessly connect with one another to form one sprawling environment. Within each region are special events entitled Big Air, Freestyle, Hill Climb, and Race, which typically involve performing as many aerial stunts as possible to outscore the competition.\n\nFreestyle MetalX also features a number of sub-games to add some diversity to the racing action. Players will ride off a cliff to see how many tricks they can perform during their rapid decent, become a human dart while hurling themselves toward an enormous dartboard, and even participate in a game of motocross pinball. Those tired of the existing courses can create their own arena using the built-in level editor.

As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. \n\nThis version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.\n\nThere are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains.

The levels in this FPS are all basic run-and-gun style.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqirX_rF2PQ","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Electronic Arts Los Angeles","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"9d7a9bb1-44fd-465f-b040-c8d3c71eb5e3.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"e4c91664-8c3e-4f57-b651-1a0eb91e5e8b.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"08380a77-2f3a-4a60-889d-429105ae1954.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"ddc6d3f0-0101-4ae7-8193-4ec27d497157.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"85c10345-4864-456c-bcdd-21b359f89a2b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"b27221ea-c0fb-4f1a-8994-c1b0cc205c99.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"30a9e4a6-2ec5-4927-aca8-7f29e197c75c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"ba2eaaa8-c7fc-42d3-b7d1-bce387b6409e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"bd86b6df-686f-44b9-a56a-b31883a4d8c5.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"e5ece34f-3895-410d-85e4-2e3ea68beec4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"621a2315-a480-4999-bcb6-611eb45968b3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"d151a0ed-d553-48de-8399-daa6cdc5e840.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"4b7e474a-f646-4252-9326-22fb67769250.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"6090b285-5bf4-43e9-9305-2d1b384bfbc3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"1a905c26-a341-411a-8107-103678ce69c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"9dde7155-b061-477d-bf0f-c5f426bec75e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"FileName":"1b552110-4eb9-4286-93a7-2c419f0ba5b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Italy"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":6984,"AlternateName":"GoldenEye: Dark Agent","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6984,"AlternateName":"GoldenEye: Agente Corrupto","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":14113,"Name":"Gotcha Force","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The lid to the toy box has blown off its hinges and the toys are ready to rumble.

The game allows you access to over 80 tunable vehicles from ten different Japanese manufacturers. Many of these cars are locked and must be obtained by playing through the game. In addition, there are several modes of play to use them on, which are Championship, Quick Race, Time Attack, Versus, and Drift-Combo.\n\nA fairly standard staple in the racing genre, the Championship is a rather straight forward career mode. In this mode, you have four classes ranging from Beginner to Professional. Beginner is free to get in, but the next three classes require you to finish the previous class and then acquire a license by passing a series of driving tests. Certain races in each class have limits on what cars can be entered, forcing you to mix things up a bit and develop different strategies.\n\nQuick Race is good if you just want to jump into the game and start. You can use any parts, cars and tracks you've unlocked so far from the Championship mode.\n\nTime Attack is a time trial mode where the object is to get the best time you can with the car and track you choose.\n\nVersus is the game's multiplayer mode. Two to four players can battle it out with any unlocked cars and tracks.\n\nDrift-Combo is a challenging mode that scores you based one how well you can drift on a selection of three drift courses. Connecting drifts raises your score and subsequently, your ranking on the board.\n\nThe Wii version is bundled with a steering wheel.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9bTioFPhjc","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"MTO","Publisher":"MTO","ReleaseDate":"2003-06-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33978,"FileName":"f15a4a21-8a06-4ced-b6f1-3cd4118636f9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33978,"FileName":"248c0ba5-6e37-4526-a7af-be7d524a3446.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33978,"FileName":"6c1d6a14-3d97-4d20-966b-8709a96578ba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33978,"FileName":"23579ac6-9604-4fb1-8347-9358efc8dfee.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33978,"FileName":"fa7843cb-ac67-4d06-9deb-fabda1aece35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6985,"Name":"Gun","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Wild Wild West meets Grand Theft Auto in this free-roaming action game. Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches, and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you.\n\nThe main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear. You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts, and kill heavily-armed bossed. There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff, or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold, and various rescue missions.\n\nThe RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes, and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons. There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items, and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts, and Winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns.\n\nThe GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents, and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness, and caves.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Role-Playing; Shooter","Developer":"Neversoft","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"b5886202-202e-4ca6-b62b-750fb59f66e7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"1bb123a6-ff8b-42fb-995f-c66fe3e46a6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"a443f1b5-c2d1-4e45-8d86-ed6676639506.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"2096e133-bca9-424d-9ae4-690adf4ce0fe.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"d537b4db-61ff-4f79-b92e-477b869a6512.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"e46003d6-9bf0-460e-adac-3ad42029c4c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"68e40f93-a669-472e-a327-0c06b9615b28.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"60c7cbc7-6501-42bf-bfb3-fa8f848ddd8a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"540eccd7-6f3d-410b-a71c-8bebd25b0405.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"5478e737-3b23-4eb4-b9ee-6b5b3514742a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"04791b3b-ae43-48c1-8623-6fe2446918af.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"83c17b89-d0c1-4516-a477-f51227b6904f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6985,"FileName":"2aba2083-8235-4ed1-bb3b-1ab472609446.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6986,"Name":"Happy Feet","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Happy Feet game features the voices of Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy, who reprise their roles from the movie.

The movie is based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.\n\nThe game follows the three main characters of the film — namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley — and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.\n\nIn addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.\n\nThere is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to \"run around\" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.\n\nThe game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.\n\nIt is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, it is also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.","MaxPlayers":"3","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Electronic Arts UK","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"c49a29f5-034d-46eb-aed3-9a37b115eea2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"610fa984-5d06-49fd-9fe3-79d1cac4c479.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"7adc4bd8-833f-4790-bbe9-e1d94757b239.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"2d19a07a-e4b6-4717-999c-176c13a1814c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"c459e774-86f9-4870-ab85-b0ac2a59015e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"93c76752-291e-4c02-a47e-81c858a55da0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"58a70e63-12a3-49a9-ae10-428215feb1fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"d85ff74e-2476-4583-a2c9-24e0b4f64bd7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"f5448d18-cf1c-4f9c-a2dc-0542918a6cdb.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"ed89a384-bcf1-40d4-b7f7-07c74d44295d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"cabc4942-38ae-40d2-a620-9ba1039aff7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"c9bb008a-0ae0-44fb-a0b8-b063a07b9455.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"1fcb7b7b-8045-46b1-a10f-6eb4f5e9764d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"e9f567fc-2fd1-4bf0-978c-1a177508880f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"242af9c7-0a37-46b6-b438-03a48f95b213.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"1cd188f2-649a-4caf-9b90-5c13bc70cc43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"9ec54590-d053-46d3-8af4-7a8acaf50583.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"FileName":"11ebb0c2-3825-4219-a2c9-488ea46356cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Sweden"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter et la Coupe de Feu","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter e il Calice di Fuoco","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter en de Vuurbeker","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter och den flammande baegaren","Region":"Sweden"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter to Honoo no Goblet","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter und der Feuerkelch","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":13458,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter y el Caliz de Fuego","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":12925,"Name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Offering a host of new features and opponents, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban looks to offer fans of this series a refreshingly new storyline as Harry and friends face their most terrifying opponents yet.

Instead of simply running and gunning through the mission, one can set sneaky traps, like poisoning a drink, to terminate the target in silence. Once again, it's up to the player to decide how he or she will kill the target.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d5UolRzwV8","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Stealth","Developer":"Io","Publisher":"Eidos","ReleaseDate":"2003-06-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"cc1ba3ce-67f8-41f5-9e4c-47cc046d58ad.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"4a52e61f-66e4-42d4-ade9-449fbf249b0c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"46719d53-08b6-4882-af10-72fc3ba11f78.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"3f3b4f7b-c925-4de7-90b4-3065cfdad655.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"15386b16-a66e-48dd-ac5a-629145bf6aaa.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"97764427-ee35-4854-bb20-4b1b0309a3ac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"4bf1d133-b095-4657-b184-298e16b4da2f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"059296b3-22be-4851-948c-cc55d344f8c4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"73807ac9-9032-4c34-bbe4-adf8b5919b01.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5432,"FileName":"1bda6a39-7718-46da-bd3e-ae1a98109468.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30855,"Name":"Home Run King","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Home Run King is an MLB-licensed baseball game released exclusively for the GameCube. Designed more as a pick-up-and-play game than a detailed simulation, it offers fast-paced gameplay and a basic selection of modes.\n\nModes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Home Run Derby. The game features team customization and player creation and trading. Players will control all aspects of play: pitching, batting, fielding and running.\n\nThe pitching interface features a pitch type selector that displays the pitches available to the current player as lines whose length indicates their effectiveness. Pitches are selected by moving the control stick in the appropriate direction, and then pressing the appropriate button for normal, slow or fast pitches or pick-off throws. A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for best results.\n\nThe batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts as well as normal, power and contact swings are possible.\n\nDuring fielding, an icon indicates the ball's height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal. Running is otherwise automatic, with only the destination base selectable.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"WOW Entertainment","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30855,"FileName":"f4e8bfe0-ed6f-41ee-ad0c-a816636d745d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30855,"FileName":"fe1ff00f-d92d-4cf6-9e48-521387e38037.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30855,"FileName":"7496c36b-1922-4675-b3c1-dad939e49814.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30855,"FileName":"23a11a91-29d4-4e6e-977c-e3bc9834d04e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30855,"FileName":"83f3e437-48d5-4b13-a116-76eb66a587e6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30855,"FileName":"6e4b30ac-ba9d-4d06-b6cb-1e6fa9099aba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91227,"Name":"Homeland","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Online servers have been shut down as of April 30, 2007.

The game’s story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra, as he battles an enemy nation using a specially-designed fighter called the Ikaruga, which can switch between two polarities: black or white. This polarity mechanic is the game’s key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. \n\nAll enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets that are the same color as the player’s ship can be absorbed, while the opposite color will do damage. As the amount of absorbed bullets increases, so does the player’s homing laser attack. When maxed out, this special attack can be up to 10x more powerful than a standard shot. Attacks can be chained together to earn bonuses that will achieve higher scores. Ikaruga features both single-player and two-player cooperative modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h__26tmbUHk","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Treasure","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"2003-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"cbeff07b-ccff-4d87-9f0f-8e14cac86b45.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"756e6885-7324-416f-a349-5272f68dc1b2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"69d70294-d2c8-4fb3-9f35-e82868c48bf2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"9eb856f5-b845-42c7-b864-76b5329bf417.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"b39c1145-4b84-4f36-ba3a-e42e732ee82b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"9e212815-ceed-48cc-a46a-01dca743fe76.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"73f5ac24-a58c-49d8-94af-d3f6df73d90a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"4ad1662d-4972-4d57-b43f-994179e1b4c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"42874102-678d-469f-8545-1ae7ba0fd167.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"c3ac634c-1aa8-49b2-be7c-fb1c75c9c20f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"6a5b4be2-dd51-4775-8457-bc0c5f031344.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"186870fc-af8e-41fe-87f7-ecb680475c8c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"35edd2b2-50a2-433f-93d2-6269574f4404.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"59860dbe-271a-4b9d-b630-f03056dbb13d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"fd1d1b4a-8e37-4c60-baff-b182eef3dbb8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"887a2c47-e310-4da1-ab1b-1fbdb892b52e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6257,"FileName":"1cc160f5-0306-4f79-9dfa-f7431fa94834.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12929,"Name":"I-Ninja","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"I-Ninja is a 3D platform title starring an original character created by British developer Argonaut Software. Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way past a diverse selection of five themed areas consisting of indoor and outdoor locales. I-Ninja is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask to cover his watermelon-shaped head, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, runs up walls and ramps, hops on a barrel to cross narrow ledges, and avoids numerous hazards while slicing at enemies. Other weapons include shurikens, swords, blowguns, rocket launchers, homing missiles, and more, with bosses and lesser villains appearing in the air, sea, and on the ground. Players will even square off against a 150-foot robot from inside a robot warrior of their own. The ultimate goal is to defeat nemesis Master O-Dor and his army of Ranx foot soldiers. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with over-the-top animations, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.\n\n\nI-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills. In true gravity defying game play, I-Ninja can scale buildings, \"shred\" on extreme rails, hover great distances with a \"sword copter\", ride drifting roller spheres and utilize specialized manga-style ninja moves to navigate through each dynamic environment.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Argonaut Games","Publisher":"Namco Hometek,Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12929,"FileName":"a314a3ca-e5fe-4092-bb95-e80eaace0749.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12929,"FileName":"00983689-f58e-43b8-b51e-fce19b81d9e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12929,"FileName":"673b42c4-efab-40fa-8fa7-11f346f2f388.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12929,"FileName":"ed1b9ee4-619b-40c3-bb01-f43cb976e859.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12929,"FileName":"630c2e50-9e02-490a-9065-7fe357af97a9.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12929,"FileName":"b3e57d88-21ac-44d0-8870-da4bf3bcce03.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6992,"Name":"Intellivision Lives!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"IntelliVision Lives! is a compilation of over sixty games that appeared on the IntelliVision game system in the early 1980's.

It is based on the 2001 computer animated film of the same name. It was featured in a two-pack with Rocket Power: Extreme Arcade Games. An Xbox version of the game was planned but was cancelled.\n\nGameplay[edit]\nThe game is a 3D adventure starring Jimmy Neutron and his robotic canine Goddard. In the game, the evil King Goobot has abducted some of Jimmy's friends, so Jimmy must begin an intergalactic quest to save them. While progressing through various locales inspired by the movie, players need to solve puzzles using an assortment of gadgets. Also included are various mini-games to play within an amusement park, as well as hidden movie clips, Rugrats and SpongeBob trailers, character bios, and movie trailers to be unlocked.\n\nPlayed from a traditional third-person perspective, the game consists of five distinct regions linked together by a main hub. Once players decide on a region, they can enter a portal and then be whisked away to a 3D world. Among the environments players explore are Jimmy's House, an Asteroid Surface, an Asteroid Interior, Yolkus Prime, and Retroland Amusement Park. Each region spans multiple levels, with the goal in each being to find a number of key items and special prizes and a shrunken head. A secondary goal in some levels is to locate friends Carl Wheezer, Cindy Vortex, Rose, Nissa, and Zachary.\n\nEnemies trying to prevent Jimmy from succeeding include giant ants and the blob-like Yokians, with villains Ooblar, Poultra, and King Goobot forming the boss encounters. Players can run, jump, kick, and use an assortment of inventions. Health can be replenished by finding slices of blueberry pie, extra lives are awarded for every ten neutrons found, and weapons include the Shrink Ray, Inflato Ray, and the Jimmy Bat. Three types of vehicles can also be used to traverse the levels, the Goddard Pogo, the Goddard Sled, and the Goddard Scooter.\n\nThe game disk includes a behind the scenes feature hosted by Nick Cannon, as well as footage from the movie, shorts, and trailers can be unlocked.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Big Sky Software","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2002-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6993,"FileName":"670e29b8-5c4f-4235-aacb-aaf6688f661d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"FileName":"ff7061c6-6e5e-4cb8-8093-7a665bca7248.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"FileName":"4a8d40ec-1fcd-4d94-a9d3-379a33985eb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"FileName":"6f20461f-68b7-49f0-a229-de9263a85987.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"FileName":"1f454757-e3fb-4f34-bdd1-831c7e919020.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6993,"FileName":"69769974-7228-48d7-9a1b-621e1396f5e8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":6993,"AlternateName":"Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, The - Boy Genius","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"AlternateName":"Nickelodeon Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"AlternateName":"Nickelodeon Jimmy Neutron: Der mutige Erfinder","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":6993,"AlternateName":"Jimmy Neutron: Der mutige Erfinder","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":27011,"Name":"Judge Dredd: Dredd vs Death","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death is a first-person shooter video game based on the Judge Dredd character from the 2000 AD comic series, developed by Rebellion Developments.

The presumed era of world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called \"Heaven Smile\", which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the International Ethics Committee (IEC). Meanwhile, the relationship between the United States and Japan deteriorate, as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA.\n\nA group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government. The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as \"Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon\", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were professional assassins in their lives, and whose souls were absorbed by Harman after they were killed in a mysterious incident fifty years ago. Garcian Smith is the leading persona among these seven, and the only one who can communicate with Harman.\n\nKiller7 is a hybrid game that incorporates shooting and puzzle-solving with light role-playing elements. The player can switch between any of the seven characters during most parts of the game. Each character has unique abilities. Dan, for example, is a true marksman, while Coyote is an experienced thief with exceptional movement. The unusual cast also includes the blind Con who moves very fast, Kaede with ranged skills, Mask who has the deadliest arsenal, the albino Kevin who can turn invisible, as well as Garcian, the leader of the pack who possesses the ability of reviving the bodies of slain personalities.\n\nDespite its 3D environments, character navigation in the game is restricted: playable characters can only move along pre-determined (though often branching) paths. Drawing out a weapon switches the view to first-person perspective with free camera rotation, but no possibility to move. Typically, the player should eliminate the approaching enemy as quickly as possible before sustaining damage, using various combinations of characters and weapons. Defeated enemies (particularly those dispatched with critical hits) yield the player \"blood\", which can be turned into serum in special rooms and used to enhance the abilities of the characters. A considerable portion of the gameplay is dedicated to solving various puzzles and gathering plot-related information by conversing with the game's exotic characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFGlYkkWUo0","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"Capcom Production Studio 4","Publisher":"Capcom Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-07-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"72fafc4f-9227-4263-a0c0-1195c5b4db64.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"5fcb03fa-ba10-4b48-a602-f8c0e3980e37.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"bf555931-58b2-4301-a803-175047e82d19.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"dc1c95c9-0586-4039-a13b-3db4c641849f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"ffedd7fd-c953-4380-b004-a7c629983703.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"4a83c0ba-74e6-4061-b31f-9b86023afbb3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"a0046e06-08f7-4b6a-8c83-c4ddd4c15479.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"cffe55bf-4ca6-4a56-86be-7ea7b161e76a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"4fbeff8c-96f5-480b-bac3-9e98648214d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"7f352053-4704-4518-8bd3-6f0f89c81058.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"548211de-130a-4245-98f6-24efd1de96b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"243428e2-07a1-4b8d-841b-4347e1d8ec07.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"d3656de4-00e5-414e-b26d-796bf38596d4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"29d45236-31bc-4012-9088-3d565eed15d4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"cbf936e2-bba0-4360-860a-37e5f980b045.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"bae790dc-c00e-4a6f-ae60-0d9bdbaf6caa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"1d039409-38f8-4c0b-8cf7-48e90c88d404.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"2ee6c473-9662-4bea-a022-10dc3deb1b06.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"8cd0300f-2717-4e34-bc99-205905c09aa1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"ce60fdfe-ca10-4c66-a10a-1640e57aab82.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"11888645-8b3d-4ee6-bf73-31514ace1ec0.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"80b4ccb4-295e-435d-bd05-817c163b020e.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"22887615-53fe-4461-99b0-d0f4b613af70.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"e49aeabf-31ac-4aa5-8ef0-b2b9645f0543.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34,"FileName":"ce9c29a5-2310-41b3-b2f9-900a0b799f81.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20611,"Name":"King Arthur","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Experience the excitement and feel of the Jerry Bruckheimer film, King Arthur as you play through Arthur's world amidst photo-realistic scenery.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.\n\nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.\n\nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.\n\nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.\n\nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.\n\nKnockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.\n\nAfter Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"EA SPorts","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"c18ebbea-b69b-4257-9680-fb946deb72b5.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"e161c813-9d8b-4c5c-9ad6-415fde4b0db0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"8fca19cf-c5c6-417c-887f-61cfdc92613c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"5dad34ac-52b4-46fc-9832-29dbaa1f0718.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"88fef250-58c7-4638-b0f0-ea71a4b5edd2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"1af920db-39fa-4e39-b277-1954cbb4f44b.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"0ed980c3-e46a-4530-9631-3593e6755094.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"fce78434-025f-47ca-ac65-44592493cbd8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"353c1266-2a55-46b0-953d-93404fa49a1e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"7cc2d15f-994c-4a42-acbb-592dcf64fd4c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"3a6e9dad-6647-4ed5-94ce-6bcc03504290.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"79e23365-cbdc-4c7e-ba90-79cbef3733f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"9644c785-365c-4b80-8b58-bd669fd197f4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"22df3ddb-d689-48cd-953a-2c0815772a19.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"c8c29eb7-c30b-419d-ab1f-72a1a2195cf4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30691,"FileName":"041cce68-8eed-4234-8527-4b7f7c29d16e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95246,"Name":"Konjiki no Gashbell!!

The game did contain Eddie Guerrero, however, who, although unemployed at the time he signed a likeness deal, re-signed with WWF when the game was released.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions included video interviews with many of the legends featured in the game while the European version of the game exclusively included four legends from the United Kingdom: Kendo Nagasaki, Big Daddy, Mick McManus and Giant Haystacks.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City","Publisher":"Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2002-11-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21007,"FileName":"9764050d-f1eb-413f-8e12-82383322016c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21007,"FileName":"7df18f3d-2ffe-4880-af19-2eb5e077fc1c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21007,"FileName":"c66d3260-660d-4667-afb1-b0ddc4ea96ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21007,"FileName":"9f0452bf-e1f4-4d3e-b830-dfb8c2f4ef35.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21007,"FileName":"3f01f1f6-e761-44b3-80cd-a58c1403bcdc.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21007,"FileName":"05021c02-5ac5-4b88-b217-aa51d21a5b90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5435,"Name":"LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lego Star Wars II is based on A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

Each mission consists of five elements: a primary objective, secondary objectives, killing a German officer (Nemesis battle in the game), obtaining documents from the officer and escaping. If all are completed, a gold medallion will be given. Missing one or two will gain a silver or bronze. Most missions involve Holt fighting alongside allied NPCs and working towards a common objective, often based on historical events during WWII.

While it generally remains faithful to the TV anime's castings, a few minor characters (such as Higuma) are completely recast.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"Ganbarion","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32358,"FileName":"3bbf563b-65a4-4fb5-ba36-eade6dc9dcc1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32358,"FileName":"8b62fa06-4588-4f4d-942e-34f1b0514f52.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32358,"FileName":"1bf7c8ca-28b1-4bd1-9e25-027e402d2654.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32358,"FileName":"a9197fd5-e743-4d4c-9898-5e39c13c0949.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32358,"FileName":"ff20d7eb-4b29-4e4b-93f4-3c82f38db318.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32358,"FileName":"8055f398-d465-429d-ac9b-47e86d85b669.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131143,"Name":"One Piece: Treasure Battle!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The One Piece video games series is based on Eiichiro Oda's shonen manga and anime series of the same name.

But beware - watching giant predators gobble your Pikmin might make you angrier than you'd expect.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W93M0hJw4Q","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"ee1c053a-be04-4b8d-810e-b900d90e151a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"c1a95e24-862f-4164-8246-6f19cbacc74f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"74ff7432-6b75-4f6c-be75-f687f58f08a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"98ebc6a0-f3db-4267-a865-c3968ab0a65d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"0ea5c68a-914b-404e-87bc-ffbe4195176f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"3f35c18b-0adf-46e7-b906-76f0fb50da8f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"8ff6b0ec-b424-4a1e-9bb7-a21df8d47adf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"29f68058-c915-4f48-a4eb-271f32535d52.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"233138c3-f426-4aea-83d2-eafbf76c8d5f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"86b9675c-984c-46f9-b367-314eda29fb5b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"03fb2cf7-52b0-4d87-84ed-19ab4c8925bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"fb35cb21-3353-4afe-999a-5062e53c1a38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"0e722704-60d0-4825-8c14-9658eb5533f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"8d1e5a89-5ebb-4e07-a302-64406ea43e5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"aa58952f-5a68-452b-af2e-ce3b8f79c737.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"34edfa91-0957-4dd8-9496-2ecd2eb0aec0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"173ccce9-bb76-4da9-b221-7879fa261ca9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"a486f2e9-a62f-403f-b68b-e54f6b092660.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"0753aa6a-54ce-40ce-ae83-f105d3996e9e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"340c0765-156b-4ba9-8289-e5951d8f22ed.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"dc0f8fa5-da29-4a72-a081-401a65394f1d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"83058994-2d65-4053-a0c2-4b0752e9de4d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"599b1af9-db43-46f4-9f34-162c0754dbe9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"ca6b8638-7beb-49da-aac8-01994a6d52f2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"f889622b-5add-4d19-939d-580bc058f3f9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"1e08453e-87eb-4589-8814-409ffd6eb5c2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"769b2a3a-69ea-49d6-b333-83c407b9846f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"68cd8907-bccb-4c5f-8d03-8ac501164727.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"d434cd59-76d3-4a63-bf7e-cb130f23c49f.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"1221504e-93b1-4d14-99c1-55cbfa99c8ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2519,"FileName":"3af042e0-d58e-4a29-8d6b-d2b170e681bf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6778,"Name":"Pikmin 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Captain Olimar has returned to the planet where the Pikmin live, and he's all business this time.

This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.\n\nThe game features a two-player mode.

The game features an arcade mode with five stages, a score attack mode, scalable difficulty, and bonus modes depending on the platform. The story follows a blue-haired schoolgirl named Shizuru Kamigusa, who is allergic to radio waves. Her father works for a company developing a remedy for the condition, but a terrorist group led by Ruki Michima takes over their building. Shizuru mans a flying mecha called a “terminal suit\" to save her father and the medicine from the terrorists. Dialog appears on the playfield throughout the game and can be dismissed by pressing a button, although this feature can be disabled.\nThe game features bullet hell gameplay elements, providing the player with a small hit box and swarms of particles to evade. Most of the bullets come in patternless waves with the exception for the mini-bosses and stage bosses which feature more regular patterns. The player may choose from three different ships each with a different spead setting, and may also choose from three different weapons: spread gun, homing laser, and bubble cannon. Each of these weapons features different ranges and speeds, so the player must utilize different strategies with them. They can also be powered up throughout the game. Once the game is started, the player is equipped with their main weapon, sword, and shield. The short-range sword can be used to destroy the same bullets and enemies the guns can destroy, but can also deflect items. This deflection mechanic allows the player to \"juggle\" items and power-ups until they are desired. When not firing, the terminal suit will automatically deploy a shield which can be used to deflect certain enemy bullets. A combo bar, which determines the score multiplier, can be increased by either using the shield to harvest energy from bullets or enemies or using the ABSNET shield, a weapon similar to Giga Wing or Mars Matrix which eliminates all minor enemies and projectiles on the screen. In order to use the ABSNET shield, the player gather blue items which drop from destroyed enemies to fill the ABSNET gauge. The combo bar slowly dissipates over time","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Milestone","Publisher":"Milestone","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":95260,"FileName":"d75469d9-7502-4945-91cc-4b362271dad4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":95260,"FileName":"29402052-1263-4fe4-92c9-371e0726b228.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":95260,"FileName":"f1cdaecd-1296-44ca-b834-8029ce9758a7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":95260,"FileName":"0718857d-f271-485e-82de-a863cb4370b7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95260,"FileName":"24a822b0-04af-477c-8f3e-d2c3b9832dce.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":95260,"FileName":"98bfc16a-d978-4954-b686-14d1e9bce453.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30901,"Name":"Rally Championship","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Features 29 cars, including Subaru, Mitsubishi, Toyota & Ford, plus classic cars such as the Audi Quattro and Mini Cooper. 24 full rally stages are available to the single player, with arcade, championship and quick race modes available.

The version by Asobo Studio is, like other versions, a 3D platform game, but has its own design, levels and missions.\n\nThe game follows the plot of the film only loosely, but has the main voice cast from the movie reprising their roles. The player controls Remy, a rat with a refined sense of taste. When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.\n\nWhile many of the environments in the game are similar to those in the next-generation version, this version has almost none of the open world elements seen in the other title, with smaller levels and mostly linear progress. To get around in the various levels that include the sewers, streets and rooftops of Paris, the restaurant kitchen and a food market, Remy can jump and double-jump, swing along poles, balance on ropes, crawl on certain walls and defend himself with tail swipes or by using spoons as weapons. He can also engage his keen sense of smell, which displays the path to the next goal or objective. Sometimes, Remy must evade guards by hiding out of sight until their attention wanes. Other sequences in the levels involve sliding down pipes, rafting through water currents and fleeing from humans that chase Remy. Another large part are mini-games, many of which involve cooking, with Remy having to pick ingredients or peel potatoes.\n\nThere are some optional bonus missions, taking the form of dream sequences, in which Remy navigates landscapes made of foodstuffs. All levels include many collectibles. In most levels there will be up to 100 stars to collect. Special items in certain levels include batteries, darts or lightbulbs.

Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length.\n\nThe manga was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from July 1999 through July 2005, and published in thirty-five tankōbon volumes by Kodansha. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series by Studio Deen. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the Toonami programming block, and re-broadcast on Syfy in 2009.\n\nThe manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version resulting in uninteresting and confusing dialogues as well as unappealing music.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"608486bd-9bd1-4da1-b1c2-7b53502f899e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"ce2ccc91-c2a1-4265-84a8-c30796f3e907.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"07d05743-0dba-44dd-8c20-275c6102713c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"afa8e095-0bbf-45e2-8862-2f3fc07e9f63.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"2ec58be5-0be9-4e53-b00f-f9b336880b93.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"230983db-b0f6-47a9-8c55-165028334270.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"8c1f8f4d-07f2-4c39-9778-3a20c47040f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30903,"FileName":"aab67447-7623-42a9-bbb6-a20f74dc5803.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":30903,"AlternateName":"Groove Adventure Rave: Fighting Live","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":11470,"Name":"Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rayman's universe has fallen into a chaotic world of wicked powers, bizarre characters, and merciless combat.

It is a spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog series and follows Shadow the Hedgehog, a creation of Doctor Eggman's grandfather, Prof. Gerald Robotnik, as he attempts to learn about his past while suffering from amnesia. Shadow the Hedgehog introduces third-person shooter elements and nonlinear gameplay to the Sonic franchise. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks, and most levels have three possible missions that the player may choose to complete. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels. The story choice can be either Hero side or Dark side. The game is rated E-10+ for ages 10 and up. After this game, Shadow becomes an ally.\n\nhttps://sega.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)\n\nAlthough it is a 3D platform game as with the more recent Sonic Adventure games, the game's levels each feature up to three different missions (Hero, Dark, Normal) that the player may choose to complete. The game's plot depends on which mission is completed as well as subsequent playable levels. The game stars Shadow the Hedgehog and his quest to recover his memory, a goal he has been pursuing since his debut in Sonic Adventure 2, while an evil alien race known as the Black Arms is invading the planet.\nThe game received mixed reviews; it has been criticized for the addition of weapons into Sonic gameplay and other dark themes (such as swearing) although it was praised for its replay value.\n\nhttps://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(game)\n\nThe world is in peril as forces, both good and evil, make a play for the powerful Chaos Emeralds. In Shadow the Hedgehog, you can control Shadow and choose which side to fight for. This 3D platformer lets you use weapons, vehicles, environmental objects, and time and space manipulation to combat your foes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frhC6b_gFFU","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"dec4fe59-de2b-40d6-b23c-79b78d1c2bfa.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"9a09a043-e951-490e-8f98-3286c6fe85a4.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"8d11ebed-3127-4f9e-bbfb-923cc62e17c6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"598d2f2b-33dd-41e5-9be1-748f469a5db2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"791ce86c-ca97-4062-93cd-643a2fc71fc5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"066f3346-a115-4e5b-95b5-bb0f45c0ff3a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"41e02b86-a1d9-45f9-a4a4-b1c780cefed2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"5b8f469a-d6dd-4590-a28d-76e19e1e6364.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"0d6a76c2-d520-401a-b27b-b90811882718.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"9a618469-c1a2-4324-86bf-4c4e58ac5b48.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"fd2296c6-408c-49f9-ac74-fcf10a75d66f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"3441c66c-4381-4e85-8394-2cf7395086c5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"cb0abce6-f422-4bcc-a337-959c3e380e86.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"673e47e2-8a25-4965-97a3-a46f4cfbb7d6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"4678da94-35d4-4908-b300-3cb14a17672f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"b4fd4cd2-2ee2-484a-9216-2946298264c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"ea5828c7-58fb-44c8-9225-79761e65d038.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12376,"FileName":"8aa54fa5-f064-4c40-b51f-eba0ba169daf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95263,"Name":"Shaman King: Soul Fight","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shaman King: Soul Fight! is a 2003 cel-shaded fighting game with turn-based strategy elements for the Nintendo Gamecube developed by Tuning Electronic, and published by Bandai.

There are 26 characters and five game modes to choose from: \"Story Mode\", \"Shaman Fight Mode\", \"Tutorial Mode\", \"Shaman King Mode\" and \"Omake Mode\". Soul Fight is one of the only console games developed by Tuning Electronic, a company which has developed a small number of low-budget arcade games.\nThis game sold well in Japan and even gained a \"Bandai The Best\" version, but never made it to the US due to Konami securing exclusivity rights to video games for the franchise in the west.\nPlayers may choose from a cast of 20+ characters featured in the series to do battle. Fighting is essentially a game of rock-paper-scissors. Characters have 3 different attacks with attributes that may be customized to their liking. Attacks are chosen and played out on-screen by the characters who are indirectly controlled. Successful attacks build a crystal meter to launch cinematic specials that come in three levels, each a step up in strength from the last. The game also features a lengthy fully voiced story mode that follows the anime and a character training mode.

You are tasked with reaching the goal in each level by tilting the playing field, resulting in your monkey \"rolling\" forward or backward. Several obstacles lay in between your monkey and the goal, and a time limit means you can never spend too long on a given level. Bananas are found across the levels, which both contribute to your score and grant an extra life per 100 collected.\n\nThe three main difficulty levels are Beginner, Advanced, and Expert, each of which offers more maps to play and a greater challenge. EX and Master levels are unlocked by performing well on these maps. A Competition mode allows multiple players to play these levels simultaneously on a split screen.\n\nThere are also various mini-games for you to unlock, such as Monkey Billiards and Monkey Bowling.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XFUORPA-Q0","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Amusement Vision, Ltd.","Publisher":"Sega Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2001-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"fc54a4cf-bfa9-4376-8690-3e15d88fc87e.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"6f8a9784-2fcd-432a-816e-2ea102f60bf3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"9322b09e-406e-45b5-81b0-7a1c9d5c71d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"a76e11b1-f6cc-4325-b9c8-d8ad1645879f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"ee301746-81b2-4004-bc4a-bbc393d686d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"bea533d2-c9c7-4f0a-b73d-138dc22bfe0e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"a0a4837e-8629-4fb4-9c24-b45a608c8ced.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"72fde3a3-b3ef-4198-8e24-ca1912e0aa5a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"a43e67be-c0bc-46b2-9fcd-fed63057ed25.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"fbf77e11-8979-46f0-877e-80a416331ca6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"945f2c51-0377-4e80-8132-fee29b5c70d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"cc7bf6d5-75a3-44dc-bc40-30f6425471f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"e17b8118-b167-4006-9b1e-30037e08eeb1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"580c8d30-d539-40de-803b-08176a39b9c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"a3d4c831-4df6-461c-b10e-d89c631bf714.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"2a7c0a03-d26d-4957-804a-421df92302d0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"84f82350-03ff-4488-aab3-2d00adc29d45.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"ea589183-9b83-4dcc-9ed5-c9bac85cae9c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"2af1d27e-43fb-41a0-b179-da895ebb4043.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"03710ec9-c4fd-4096-bca0-664d4c4acdce.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"d5ea351a-111a-4256-ab9e-88d14f935a76.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"aba7cace-d158-4f03-8b5d-6ca0c4fb7e53.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6780,"FileName":"44e0d8f6-fbe6-4864-9a56-b9a6081b9350.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10070,"Name":"Super Monkey Ball 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon are on a roll again.

Supa Robotto Taisen?).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Banpresto","Publisher":"Banpresto","ReleaseDate":"2004-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":113994,"FileName":"f3ce59e3-7f43-4f2a-aae3-72326e224e58.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":113994,"FileName":"0bd18b54-609c-4370-a182-f1ece196184d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":113994,"FileName":"12c372bb-342b-4d03-ab76-afe350a51cd3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":113994,"FileName":"a5f60c21-220b-422c-a503-66ae2b621660.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":113994,"AlternateName":"Super Robot Taisen GC","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":167050,"Name":"Super Shine Bros.

Instead, opposing players must force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORQ4sWskyaM","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"fd6849a3-c353-45e7-bc41-511840afd3b9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"bc1471f7-0124-4b38-a88f-e650f73156af.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"de4489d7-2781-4f39-93ce-797cabe9d560.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"a7ffaa59-34d7-419d-b2dd-1e166894350a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"42722ad0-328e-4b14-ba1a-a972a3983222.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"0280f840-d6ab-4b28-8604-3fcea963dded.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"c204476f-180f-4ce2-b44a-d4c52e3869ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"fb0b5857-863a-4072-911f-13004beb6101.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"edc84ae3-994f-4cd2-aaf9-c56c7f1b0cd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"13b447a5-1b3a-4c81-9881-60c3f906aaee.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"b8bbb99f-570e-4a65-aa4c-d769aac6d686.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"9b967f5d-b0e1-4421-9fea-35e3951836ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"639f8b68-661e-437f-8288-387521b63ad2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"fedf4290-46da-42da-a313-32dceff79680.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"0c3fc017-b1cc-4c01-b98d-cd9b1f6fe36d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"296f4399-df14-4450-877f-388fca80c57e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"49e277b1-75dd-47b0-aaba-ac3f548cc05d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"6a50a9dc-ac31-440d-ab12-6c322c7ceed0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"09c7be14-be2c-4412-8fd6-63f48e84eb3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"f68a4043-7fed-43f5-93aa-244dab6c6376.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"c35059cd-f8c5-473d-bac5-7fdf40028ebc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"decba4b2-1fc9-4590-a134-b6040b4423f7.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"240396d5-630e-450b-b88a-bd3bc835ee21.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"273a9b53-79e4-4899-b254-03157ee749dc.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"d42a1850-c123-43a5-aaa9-cf49d16158bd.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"d3e9ef76-fca4-41e5-8b57-d704983a5a6a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"fb9b54fb-ae16-414a-a1d9-53847960a337.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"1216e48b-e82c-472e-b62b-00374793bcb6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"eecf0b7a-c6e0-4229-aad8-ec3d01b8609b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"69c6290f-83ae-40ca-ac05-41efee61211f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"1d4c386b-fce4-4ece-8a06-08c3047b90cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5654,"FileName":"2c833d4f-fd0e-4431-9de4-802c371ae249.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5654,"AlternateName":"Dairantou Smash Brothers DX","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":198087,"Name":"Super Smash Bros.

Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen. The characters have to reach various checkpoints to extend the level. All the levels take place in the various jungle settings of Tak's Village.

When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder into three clones of himself.

The player controls Link, the protagonist of the Zelda series. He struggles against his nemesis, Ganondorf, for control of a sacred relic known as the Triforce. Link spends a large portion of the game sailing, traveling between islands, and traversing through dungeons and temples to gain the power necessary to defeat Ganondorf. He also spends time trying to find his little sister.\nThe Wind Waker follows in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time and its sequel Majora's Mask, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the two Nintendo 64 titles. A heavy emphasis is placed on using and controlling wind with a baton called the Wind Waker, which aids sailing and floating in air. Controversial during development for its use of cel shading graphics and younger Link character, The Wind Waker received acclaim on release and is one of the Nintendo GameCube's most popular games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP42wusaHJI","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E -

The game was published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to the 2002 game The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.\n\nThe game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and his 2003 film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel, The Return of the King, the third volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films.[12]\n\nThe game is similar to its predecessor in basic gameplay, but differs by adding multiple storylines, more playable characters and increased interaction with environments. A two-player co-op mode is also available for some missions. As with The Two Towers, The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with the filmmakers, using many of the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props and other assets from the film. The game was met with positive critical reception for its graphics, audio, and gameplay, although its camera positioning and short length were criticized.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Hypnos Entertainment","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2003-11-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"b69944b7-98c7-4575-978c-cb0252a399e5.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"e1551a3a-dde3-4091-a5e3-ee81988a2fc8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"9e1e6b03-9333-4203-9668-7954ed1226f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"76de8781-cc9f-4f20-adec-c9bdfb22e12f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"2c002298-5dd2-4573-b057-c9a61e1dd55d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"85673df2-9e42-453e-8e3b-61ed9c3b3e3a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"47012089-7e8a-4b55-9002-94d6404c71ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"e3f596a4-7ab1-49e8-9f61-4a55d1217929.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"aa8953a4-d3e7-4698-94b9-5f9471a4e1c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"36a6d499-9eb4-4712-a737-a0b241c5649f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"ded2afc1-f63b-48dc-ad45-2f3707b1643f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"ab817d81-b23b-4c98-94e2-59033c6528a4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"4f212b08-460e-4fff-9424-673979053bcb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"e27f173e-6378-43c0-9ff8-e910781f5a11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"d29916d2-25ef-4da5-a485-bffc0351b285.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"bd394bd6-63ab-407a-93df-943327e25530.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"2102ae32-e848-4a83-8637-347d165d2d1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"FileName":"b5b188c6-23af-4595-9a1a-388ec19c055c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Seigneur des Anneaux, Le - Le Retour du Roi","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Signore degli Anelli, Il: Il ritorno del Re","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Senor de los Anillos, El: El Retorno del Rey","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Herr der Ringe, Der: Die Rueckkehr des Koenigs","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Der Herr der Ringe: Die Rueckkehr des Koenigs","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Lord of the Rings: Ou no Kikan","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"El Senor de los Anillos: El Retorno del Rey","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"El Senor de los Anillos: El Retorno del Rey","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7060,"AlternateName":"Il Signore degli Anelli: Il ritorno del Re","Region":"Italy"}]},{"DatabaseID":6999,"Name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Lord of the Rings:The Third Age introduces entirely new characters which aren't mentioned in the books or movies.

It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims.[1]\n\nThe game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters.\n\nThe Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Apple Mac OS X was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009.[2][3]\n\nThe Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.[4] During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold.[5] The Sims 2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.[6][7] As of March 2012, The Sims 2 has sold at least six million PC copies and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all-time.[8]","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Maxis","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"dbe196a4-5bb9-4498-96dc-575b3c392f6c.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"122ca811-1b63-472b-a833-480b87c83090.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"05755706-1dcc-4e86-9dd6-f49b70cff92d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"e00c67b7-6735-41f4-9360-62e4a0ef5955.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"bfb8a0af-c555-4965-90de-e09602fa5076.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"d7754482-9c12-4563-ad43-d813c310764b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"e2e74569-45d7-45d0-8595-e23184496357.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"3ea5bcf9-2f5f-4f2e-bbaf-b38010b03152.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"9a5c1f2b-8485-4eba-86e3-e7d6320b773c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30911,"FileName":"d076d7b5-f2e5-414e-86ca-d6e1c282bc48.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":30911,"AlternateName":"Los Sims 2","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":7058,"Name":"The Sims 2: Pets","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Sims 2: Pets is the first game in The Sims franchise on the Wii and offers the gameplay from the original game combined with the pets add-on.

It is based on the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.\n\nGameplay[edit]\nMost of the characters from the series are playable in this game, including the protagonist four Turtles and Splinter, April O'Neil, and Casey Jones. The Shredder and Hun, two of the show's main antagonists, are also playable, as well as varying types of Foot Ninja. Other characters, such as Traximus, and Sleeg are also playable.\n\nIn the game there are 4 game modes: Last Man Standing, Knock Out, King of the Hill, and Keep Away. In Last Man Standing, the goal is to be the last living player. Knock Out challenges the player to KO the most players in a set time or to reach a set amount of KO first. King of the Hill's goal is to get to a set amount of points before the other players. To gain points, players must stand in the light beam that moves to set places on the map. Finally, the goal of Keep Away is to carry a chest to gain points. While carrying the chest, players are unable to attack. The carrier must run away from the other players because being hit will cause the carrier to drop the chest.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"4b99a8fe-772f-48eb-b2fa-9fa93122aa0a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"dc1bca4c-fa24-4af2-ae13-3c6fc23d96f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"dc59e115-e013-4a1f-8a5d-64b84f2bf083.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"18e9484a-f34e-4423-add6-22fbaf0c6360.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"0467ed35-ed66-4c7c-886c-b168018ea242.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"494ba62e-8f18-432e-9884-2ff53ec99299.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"34240c9e-78f6-47f7-9026-48e75917f984.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11465,"FileName":"b67b09ec-557f-4413-928d-5ca01f8dfeb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20605,"Name":"Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Are you ready to kick some butt with Tom and Jerry and friends?

It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear.\n\nThe game's story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.\n\nUnlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades .

This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal.

There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an \"arch\", allowing players to reach difficult areas.\n\nShooting blocks will have one of two effects:\n\nIf the player hits a block that is either the same colour as the bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up was the coloured blocks that were just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.\nIf the player hits a block that is a different colour from the bazooka missile, or is a \"dead block\" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.\n(Weapons are affected differently by other blocks.

Wolverine fights from a fixed third-person view; the player essentially has to \"button mash\" his way through hordes of soldiers and classic X-Men villains as Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike. Iceman can fly; his abilities are widely used when he traverses the ice bridge to fly out and save places such as a nuclear power plant and the Statue of Liberty. As Nightcrawler, the player views the world from a free third-person perspective; he possesses a teleportation ability, which allows him to drop on his enemies while getting the missing Cerebro parts and saving the Brooklyn Bridge from Mirror Man.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGm1MK_T5UQ","Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Hypnos Entertainment","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2006-05-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"1fbbc0d7-bc09-4e1f-bae0-fa15f0209bac.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"244bce27-eb1a-4aff-a85c-377c1ff508aa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"c12bd4d1-f25d-426a-9800-a27ec4c22bfb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"9c3670cc-b568-4a28-8b3d-bd280fa4f161.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"58ea04fa-1247-4917-8166-72de07d64f91.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"7ca01ad2-178a-4076-9c76-dbca4b2a3fce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"bea6814b-3f9a-4618-b2c1-2a1975bb34f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"e1925ae2-9365-43ec-a1a2-3238951ba79d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"3eaf3453-3a07-44fd-9088-5e9ef7fb7545.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30940,"FileName":"119ba1a7-ee52-48c1-a733-387927b3fd2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29725,"Name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!

In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo GameCube","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Puzzlekings","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"0573e5f7-61ed-4bed-a8a5-8632a33e0074.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"6b450047-08ea-45ff-868d-7e7da175b558.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"2897ba2f-6d47-4a60-b313-03ce4b68cbeb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"085bae0f-daa5-468e-ba63-2a2588116420.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"a38dba0c-d7a5-4bf4-9cf8-0c21b1546730.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"6e4fad9d-9144-4106-a713-232a86c232c6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"aff4fc2a-9534-4378-ac3e-78930b20abe4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"b1e9ffff-5a50-4a5b-90e2-d55c63e4db02.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"6be3375c-1a7e-4a60-a451-476fb958d971.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"415433d1-3926-4cbe-b65c-73a3f08ff178.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"8a093537-24a9-43a1-9d4a-a2b6b44d1a95.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"85f2b501-ff3f-455a-a52c-3e08bfe447ad.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14319,"FileName":"c8e2ea12-9198-496b-8956-b0a72472537c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
