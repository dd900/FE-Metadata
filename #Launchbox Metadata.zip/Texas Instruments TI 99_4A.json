Each of the six mountains the player climbs has various obstacles which should be avoided: falling rocks, avalanches, wild animals, trees, and brush fires can all hinder progress. Being hit by these obstacles will cause the player to lose progress, falling down part of the mountain (some obstacles cause a short falling distance, others a long distance).\n\nShould the player fall all of the way to the bottom of the mountain a life will be lost. To help anticipate obstacles, voice synthesis provide a warning when danger is near. Each mountain has a time limit in which it must be climbed, though the timer only counts down when the climber isn't moving. As the player progresses through the levels the mountains become higher and obstacles become faster and more numerous.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Texas Instruments TI 99/4A","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Texas Instruments Incorporated","Publisher":"Texas Instruments Incorporated","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181983,"FileName":"b5430a82-a9b9-450e-aa66-a4ebedef4d78.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":181983,"FileName":"d6788346-cc99-4858-b856-b71f810c15d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":181983,"FileName":"2da9aa68-ad4d-4530-b762-3b42d2dd97eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181983,"FileName":"ea33bc2d-ae9f-4d57-bfd8-da04195c290e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":172425,"Name":"Astro Cube","ReleaseYear":"2018","Overview":"Astro Cube is a free fixed screen shooter for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A.

Controlling the ship involves side scrolling to the left or right, stop, moving forward (and faster), and moving backwards/break (and slower). Additionally, the spaceship can also fire its weapon to unleash a pair of energy bolts.\n\nThe player starts in sector 1.0 and will finish this level after the player successfully goes between an allocated number of pylons, indicated at the top left side of the screen; the first requirement is 9 pylons and will gradually increase with each new sector. In sector 1.1., with the addition of having to complete the pylon requirement, a group of flying saucers, ranging from 1 to 4 (per group), fly in a pattern. The player must avoid these flying saucers by maneuvering out of their way or by shooting them down. In sector 1.3., a new type of robot spaceship (at least one) will fly erratically and attempt to crash into the player's space ship (due to the marvel of technology of that era, enemy ships that disappear from one side of the screen, will emerge on the other side of the screen). Later sectors will gradually introduce more difficult challenges.\n\nThe game ends when the player loses all three lives by crashing into (or being crashed by, it seems sometimes) pylons or enemy space ships. Although there is no penalty in avoiding pylons altogether, the game will also end if the allocated amount of time (indicated by a long bar at the top center screen) runs out. The player may increase speed to move faster, which will present maneuverability challenges in itself. The overall score increases by distance traveled, pylons traveled through, and enemy spaceships shot down. The latest score and the high score are saved and shown in the main menu.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Texas Instruments TI 99/4A","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","Publisher":"Texas Instruments Incorporated","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181986,"FileName":"7cef2d74-1bc7-4209-9b98-ba78fa01dcef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":181986,"FileName":"42f87c4e-429d-4d2a-a52b-ee7aa035f907.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181986,"FileName":"9c968f4d-8bae-46e2-b3ae-67b0bb46818a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181953,"Name":"BurgerTime","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area.\n\nTo properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below.

Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves.\n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands.\n\nInsect Opponents and Mushrooms\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\n\n    The Centipede\n    The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\n    Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\n    The Spider\n    The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.\n\n    The Flea\n    The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\n    The Scorpion\n    The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\n    Mushrooms\n    Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom. \n\n\nGame Difficulty and Variations\nThe game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:\n\n    One Player\n    Two Player Alternating\n   \nScoring\nThe player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:\n\n    Centipede Head - 100 points\n    Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n    Spider at close range - 900 points\n    Spider at medium range - 600 points\n    Flea - 200 points\n    Scorpion - 1,000 points\n    Restored mushroom - 5 points\n    Destroyed mushroom - 1 points","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHLnkJPfNvI","Platform":"Texas Instruments TI 99/4A","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Robert Lafore","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"9d02a0ef-fb7e-4d9a-9ede-5c3035b12cf8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"82902907-580f-43c3-a9f8-11659ba2fedd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"bfaace20-6f21-498f-83b4-9de1ce34ab9a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"1c45acb4-adee-41b9-a44b-57f380c746d1.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"31eede53-dcf6-4387-9dda-37971d8156ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"f8bca15a-a747-43cf-aeb2-4722a5207794.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"2f771f2d-f17b-453d-aab0-7c2007242c0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"b2712698-8a5c-46b2-860b-7fc51f50030f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182055,"FileName":"bdd16e23-293a-4d7f-bb53-a12fe37241fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":148670,"Name":"Chisholm Trail","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Players take the role of a cattle driver on the Chisholm Trail, bringing their cattle to set destinations while defending them against cattle rustlers and wranglers.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Texas Instruments TI 99/4A","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"K- Byte","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181995,"FileName":"306e5b13-0ffe-4657-8f1d-bd4091cf6fe1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":181995,"FileName":"434063ed-99df-452c-91da-516f1a0382da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":181995,"FileName":"8e03917b-ff40-4cab-bbae-e0fc89cab2fe.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181995,"FileName":"95e48f97-71ad-4383-b1fa-7b11eb7182bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":181995,"FileName":"bc76097a-d40e-49e5-a27b-aff5651cf313.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181995,"FileName":"1fec6ff7-8260-4666-8d32-7ff56fdf3cb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181996,"Name":"Frogger","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen.
