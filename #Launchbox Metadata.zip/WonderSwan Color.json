The attacks are displayed as short animé-style sequences. During your turn, you must press the A button repeatedly to increase the power of your attack. The enemy attacks simultaneously, and you have to invest enough power in your attack in order for it to connect.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Shade","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2001-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"b2fef295-b017-4433-89cc-b3cef7d1d71f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"3dee5628-78fa-41d7-bcde-737c8e494cd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"00f56fd9-a662-4e4e-912f-c842ed5e6a01.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"f4bbbf1c-2d45-4088-b8b2-96fe964f3936.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"d635a8d1-4df4-419b-a540-c41bd5baacc9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"132ccb31-0a25-4a5d-b6ef-ec8cdc9fe2f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27701,"FileName":"02aad205-1e10-4517-90d4-0b9b04a9346a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27698,"Name":"Digimon: Anode Tamer & Cathode Tamer: Veedramon Version","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This release contains the first Digimon Adventure, both Anode Tamer and Cathode Tamer versions.

However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king's orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king's inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal.\n\nThe fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters.\n\nThe game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full.\n\nUnlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters' abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class: dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game's plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sting","Publisher":"Squaresoft","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"4d6793fb-4cb3-4c8f-8573-fe8dda989700.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"341230a4-ddae-42cf-888d-f9ca676835f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"15e096a7-60c9-4fae-ba95-f72a3f490702.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"4404d82f-f1b7-4a1b-bfbf-1af978d8549a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"ffe6b7e3-03aa-47f5-a3ea-038727d33f9b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"ba8f730d-dfcf-40a9-81db-2dac29c2c8ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"b3e4cd90-0576-416b-980e-6a1890003b8f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"19e9aa70-763f-4850-8663-f62502dba229.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"69fa2543-15fe-4ea2-bf0b-8f6ad70113cc.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"b1623578-abfe-4952-9028-fc2e5acf1061.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27706,"FileName":"8a4ffa10-d99e-4afb-9da9-5abce4ec79fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19636,"Name":"Final Lap Special: GT & Formula Machine","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Final Lap Special is equipped with two modes: GT Machine and Formula Machine mode.

The enemy this time is an original character called Yakumo, a half-witch who manipulates dreams, and a battle in the dream world will be unfolded.\n\nThe game has a lot of original scenes, and the total number of events is 2.5 times higher than the previous work Sengoku Nikki.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Tomcat System","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2002-11-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"e20e1eff-b3a5-4c69-8ba7-14680facd373.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"999f079e-dea7-4352-a0ae-130d21245151.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"8a9630ea-f553-4f6b-9632-81e472c1873e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"bd51df0e-dd55-46df-8bef-850881c38ee1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"987c53e1-2da3-428e-a7a5-c8c729874b44.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"d57617a2-fecd-4dac-9173-60cef086d3b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27727,"FileName":"340f4047-2d6f-4b72-9a31-e4d9a4de186c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19638,"Name":"Judgement Silversword: Rebirth Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In your space fighter, the S-AIXAK, you'll be going up against the minions of the Judgement Silversword.

This is especially common before obstacles that might require outlandish button combos.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Music","Developer":"NanaOn-Sha","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-09T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"cfb0a2d8-637c-4efe-be40-3a3f0175323f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"a40e3ba3-2b08-4c66-9a48-25750041a538.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"a592afcc-a0f7-4ec1-bb6e-7dcc094394fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"7567cebe-c066-441f-b041-389d0059f579.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"bd804061-bbea-47a3-8c60-828220efdee8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"1860a224-0971-4d3b-9301-97ddd6c99394.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"a03156fa-f092-4c78-af08-757e82cbfb55.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"dcce5dad-2576-4449-b48b-6802e729a02d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27747,"FileName":"df823499-65cf-4a37-ad5a-400fe4dd4dbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27748,"Name":"Riviera: Yakusoku no Chi Riviera","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"During the great Ragnarok war, the gods of Asgard were overrun by demons from Utgard. In order to save the rest of the world from demons, the gods sacrificed their lives to create Grim Angels, black-winged warriors armed with sacred weapons known as \"Diviners\". The Grim Angels defeated the demons, and turned Utgard into a beautiful land, Riviera.\n\nThousand years later, a rumor concerning the demons' return begins to spread. Hector, one of the seven Magi entrusted by the gods to watch over Riviera, sends the Grim Angels Ein and Ledah there, ordering them to activate the \"Retribution\", a power that would eliminate the demons but also destroy Riviera. Ein is defeated by Ursula, Riviera's guardian, and wakes up with amnesia, unaware of his past and the role he will have to play in the future of the land.\n\nRiviera: The Promised Land is a Japanese-style role-playing game. Unlike most RPGs, it does not allow the player to physically navigate a character to explore the game world. Instead, the player activates \"triggers\", i.e. events that lead to cutscenes, combat, items, etc., by spending special trigger points earned during battles. This is done by investigating areas, moving from screen to screen.\n\nOnce a turn-based battle is triggered, the player selects three active combatants out of the available five, selects a formation for the party (attack- or magic-oriented), and chooses which four items to bring into the battle. The items activate skills for various characters; if a character has been trained with that item, he or she can use powerful \"OverSkills\" by gradually filling the OverDrive gauge. Items can be used a limited amount of times before they break.\n\nThe game also contains dating gameplay elements. The player can make decisions for Ein concerning his female companions, raising or lowering their trust level and eventually reaching one of the multiple endings determined by the relationships between Ein and the young women in his party.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sting","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2002-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27748,"FileName":"005f6f52-7480-4085-ba67-03b435e053fc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27748,"FileName":"51e98b8a-40d4-4e09-99b3-c0b35ccb85b8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27748,"FileName":"f1c6897a-2a4c-4741-a6d4-022ce067950e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27748,"FileName":"2e65fa4b-c05b-4aa6-9dd3-eef6e295fe2c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27748,"FileName":"6d4da18d-ea0f-4b00-a56e-2305da7539ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27748,"FileName":"869aa3c7-e3f8-442b-86a9-dce3cad9b0ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19640,"Name":"Rockman EXE WS","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Like Mega Man Network Transmission, Rockman EXE WS is a side-scrolling, platform-based video game.

Fighting is done in real-time, and after battling many weaker enemies, one will usually face a boss. While the player starts the game alone, they will get a pet companion, choosable out of four different types, in the middle of the journey.

After that, your character begins an adventure in a town.
