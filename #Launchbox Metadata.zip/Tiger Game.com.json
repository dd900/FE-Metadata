It included only Leon Kennedy's story path, and removed several of the original game's core features.\nHaving been developed for a woefully under-powered console, it lacks much of what defined the original game. It can be seen as attempting to boil Resident Evil 2 down to its bare essentials: Killing zombies and collecting items. However, with the poor framerate and lack of visual fidelity afforded by the Game.com, it fails even in this regard. Despite this, it is known as one of the best games for the Tiger Game.com.\n\nIn the history of the franchise, it is the first game to be rated \"T\" for Teen by the ESRB, as opposed to the more typical \"M\" for Mature. This rating can be attributed to the Game.com's inability to render the same level of graphic violence as the original game.","Publisher":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Resident_Evil_2"},"125598":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"4bcf5282-738f-49d2-a5bc-a5736b5d4ea9.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dde07305-d082-46e7-8f0e-85688d49d467.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7346b689-4cb2-41fe-9952-e3159e519888.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"45f124ea-9941-4ff5-826c-faf88324e14a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6f81c776-9d05-406d-8a79-72572baef593.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"34ccfcd3-e363-4e45-a1fa-ea3d37cb961a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Williams Arcade Classics","Overview":"Five of the greatest arcade hits of all time - now available in one portable collection: Joust, Defender, Robotron, Defender 2 (Stargate), Sinistar!

Only 13 characters (Cyrax, Ermac, Jade, Mileena, Sektor, Kitana, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Raiden, Reptile and Shao Kahn) and 10 Kombat Zones remain in this version (screenshots of early releases showed a different assortment of characters). In addition, each character only has two special moves and four finishing moves: one Fatality, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality. In this version, each finishing move has the same command for every character.","Publisher":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1998,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_Trilogy"},"125612":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Quiz","Images":[{"FileName":"c24d2e97-d213-428e-a0d9-7c80e745eed0.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c16cd1e3-8589-4135-80df-de0766afb5e1.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"196564c8-6aa8-4ba8-a2d4-1db8faa25657.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b3b9c15a-6540-42c5-ab34-346bfbf08143.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b66e72e2-3f78-4cb8-b509-9fdd8186bdcd.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7ea0ff54-b80f-491f-9b53-322c6e796165.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Quiz Wiz: Cyber Trivia","Overview":"Based on the electronic game that was made by Tiger, Quiz Wiz: Cyber Trivia challenges up to three players to answer a series of questions in five categories: Sports, Famous People, Film and TV, Potpourri, and General Knowledge.","Publisher":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1997},"125613":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"06af0973-7da6-4eab-9301-59d4d6837b78.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"99000697-e02f-44e7-b7f8-91f9c596e531.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b3609190-8a4f-46ad-b3c5-5280b6f54a81.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5383f8df-37f8-4bca-a77d-152e17c3c0ed.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8fe1919b-7fa7-42c4-ba73-1e631600f798.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a674bebb-dabf-4dce-9ac6-2b87023cd685.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Scrabble","Overview":"The World's Best-Loved Word Game is now the ultimate interactive world game!
