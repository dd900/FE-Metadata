It included only Leon Kennedy's story path, and removed several of the original game's core features.\nHaving been developed for a woefully under-powered console, it lacks much of what defined the original game. It can be seen as attempting to boil Resident Evil 2 down to its bare essentials: Killing zombies and collecting items. However, with the poor framerate and lack of visual fidelity afforded by the Game.com, it fails even in this regard. Despite this, it is known as one of the best games for the Tiger Game.com.\n\nIn the history of the franchise, it is the first game to be rated \"T\" for Teen by the ESRB, as opposed to the more typical \"M\" for Mature. This rating can be attributed to the Game.com's inability to render the same level of graphic violence as the original game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tiger Game.com","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Horror","Developer":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","Publisher":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"401681be-5bcb-488e-b606-ae13a00ea8cd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"fd3da27e-45e8-4048-ac51-5a44840d18c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"33b5cbc8-9722-4a5c-a6e8-b9f5c10c8067.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"47c7c1c5-fa22-4bab-8fff-fdecdc6874a4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"4886bcf1-b4ef-41d6-946c-f3062d4bd127.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"03118a68-65d8-4bcf-a933-38d19672ea94.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122214,"FileName":"0bdaa0b7-8ef0-4191-af3f-d2ebb64d7f0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125613,"Name":"Scrabble","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":"The World's Best-Loved Word Game is now the ultimate interactive world game!
