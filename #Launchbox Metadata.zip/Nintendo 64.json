Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.\n\nThroughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl5-qgyU-Z8","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1999-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"33c0e0d2-8556-4d32-837c-1512e409153f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"bb0b2423-4776-4553-9cf1-6bc630c5c435.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"d43e5096-5312-443c-9501-d12b4befd9eb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"ce64393d-0880-4d75-b343-bb545aa5e47a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"0eae1b09-1a30-4931-96b4-d93fd43f7414.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"43f08dc4-be28-413a-80ed-59c458a8636d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"5f7830f0-2717-4cf7-9706-b4a95569b8fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"6c7aa861-c195-46eb-94c2-5191daddddde.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"05fd1864-62c1-48ae-9d77-e99b5cd02d2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"7c253997-26e9-4a63-afdd-23ded42146a4.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"ba70593d-63d8-4f19-87bc-172b2cabd062.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"cc143715-48c6-46e9-a0b3-d8c99cebcae6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"666adcdc-991f-4776-b272-09139e129156.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"dbf37b44-55d4-4cc7-abc5-0b02ef581a81.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"7ae66c03-da08-4cdd-99f0-6db771682383.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"69596419-a1f2-4963-9b85-f0433166d96d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"b6428c24-b89f-4c46-8e0d-c7475cb23409.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"FileName":"a92c96a2-c230-4086-ac9c-208a08cecc2a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":239,"AlternateName":"Disney•Pixar A Bug's Life: Vida de Inseto","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":239,"AlternateName":"Disney•Pixar A Bug's Life","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":239,"AlternateName":"Bichos: Una Aventura en Miniatura","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":239,"AlternateName":"Disney•Pixar 1001 Pattes","Region":"France"}]},{"DatabaseID":1052,"Name":"Aerofighters Assault","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Aero Fighters Assault team needs your help to save the Earth from the evil Phutta Morgana organization and their machines of doom.

Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.\n\nBody Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions.

You move the paddle from left to right to knock the ball back against a breakable wall until all the bricks are gone; and then you move on to the next level. There are 50 levels in total, and they contain a variety of blocks. Some require one hit, others multiple hits, some are indestructible and the special blocks drop upgrades for your paddle and ball. I only managed to make it to The Ridge, since I encountered a glitch that made the ball get stuck at the top of the level.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from other Arkanoid style games is that it has a scrolling screen as well as several terrain features that make the level never be a perfect rectangle. This might not seem like a big difference at first, but it adds a whole level of challenge. Half of the time you’re playing, you can’t see the ball, so you have to familiarize yourself with the layout of the level and predict where it is going to bounce ahead of time.\n\nAs with most Arkanoid and Pong games, the center of the paddle bounces the ball straight up, and the edges shoot it off in either direction. One odd thing that I noticed is that the vertical speed is always constant. The horizontal speed varies depending on where the ball enters contact with the paddle. This makes a bit strange when there’s a sudden change in angle since it appears that the ball is rapidly accelerating or decelerating and lacking any sense of momentum.\n\nThis is definitely worth having a look at it, as it’s the largest and most complete unique N64 game out there.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Protest Design","Publisher":"Protest Design","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":168100,"FileName":"7ed942d0-e8f7-4a9b-ab8f-7798dea51119.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168100,"FileName":"87ad6662-6b04-4ca5-ace7-af33067fd8c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168100,"FileName":"a205b312-575c-4a6e-bf57-17d7596521a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168100,"FileName":"0db8864d-db6a-4f48-a7d3-6b99a469b4e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168100,"FileName":"87464bb5-5179-46b7-8b12-53de20437f35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168100,"FileName":"6cb2307d-c035-4acf-9c60-714c6a841f5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25736,"Name":"Dezaemon 3D","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dezaemon 3D is more of a game creator than an actual game.

Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. \n\nSolid Gear is a \"serious\" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. \n\nUsagi is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles... and bunnies.

After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.\n\nDiddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the \"Silver Coin Challenge\". In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).\n\nThe game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.\n\nUp to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXvzvNZYOjc","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E -

Although Rare scrapped the project due to Nintendo wanting it to be a Star Fox title on the GameCube, there is still a lot of leftovers from the game's development, which led to the game evolving into what became \"Star Fox Adventures\".\n\nA prototype of the game was published by Forest of Illusion on February 20th, 2021, who had purchased a CD from a private Swedish collector containing the late prototype.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH_Nn4QwHgU&","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"fff985eb-1cac-4402-b528-2b3b0c1972b8.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"99ff5f0e-55f4-408e-b383-6c4487b1eea0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"2efe02d0-67c3-4fc4-86ae-a410e13d21bd.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"b262479f-9f1c-42b6-89e4-b528f41088e0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"146e0775-e087-4ee4-b207-5157336489c3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"4709489b-37d1-4853-9777-9b4b04a08142.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"fd7c0c24-8fa1-4070-8b06-a610cc815a38.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"7aaa1b07-4f14-475c-93c3-7d85961e3f13.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"c351f2ad-8976-47a1-94c0-fc7d016d6fc2.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"d8773569-0ec6-437b-84f2-c86bbb23b7fc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"31a21d86-475b-46d5-902c-141669d76f88.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"70b1eb1f-34c0-4a87-a382-e19840e2bfc1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"228f298d-48e2-40c7-86e8-6c3992167cdb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"553ff683-e39d-4e85-b824-2e90017e03d9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199680,"FileName":"4fbe29e0-6af1-4d40-a43b-c76f12444a31.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1089,"Name":"Disney's Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You play as Donald in this 3D platform action game.

On New Year’s Day, when the planets are aligned with the sun, the ZoS, an alien race from a parallel dimension, take over the Hedron Universe, extinguishing the sun and transporting all of the Hedrons to the alien dimension. The only Hedron to evade capture is Freak Boy, who is destined to become the hero of his people, provided he can rid his universe of the alien threat and return the captive Hedrons to their rightful dimension. As Freak Boy, players can absorb remnants of the destruction into their body and utilize them as weapons to destroy the alien invaders. What’s more, the variations on these weapons are almost endless. Capable of holding three new artifacts at a time, each with a different capability when used as head, chest or feet, Freak Boy is never the same character twice. Freak Boy’s body is constantly morphing as new artifacts are assimilated and old ones are discarded. In managing the inventory of weapons as they enter and exit Freak Boy’s body, the player gains new abilities in his fight to destroy the more than 50 enemies who have set out to conquer the Hedron universe. On their quest for more powerful weapons and the alien enemy, players will explore more than 25 distinct worlds throughout five levels of difficulty. Each world is radically visual, arid and stark, yet with texture, mystery and entertainment that lure the player further into the world of Freak Boy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNhLdcAIW00","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Burst","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184748,"FileName":"a899d000-ed78-4e95-a618-472659d0a10d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184748,"FileName":"8c828c0d-5666-453e-81a3-6aab157cf931.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22448,"Name":"Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge is a video game released in 2000 for various platforms.

Not much, but there are small differences. Moneypenny/GoldCoin however actually has some different dialog such as mentioning that there is a girl in the cell next to you for Bunker 2. However the story itself is mainly the same as the original, with all Levels playing out basically the same as the original. There's small differences but for the most part it's just bug fixes with nothing majorally different to the levels....besides Train because characters are different sizes compared to the original but it functions the same as the original. \n\nCharacters: \nJames Bond - Mario \nNatayla Simonova - Peach \nAlec Trevelyan - Luigi \nXenia Onnatop - Daisy \nArkady Ourumov - Bowser \nBoris Grishenko - Yoshi \nDimitri Mishkin - Donkey Kong \nValentin Zukovsky - Wario \nMay Day - Pauline \nOddjob - Toad \nJaws - Waluigi \nBaron Samedi - Rainbow Bowser, the Powered-Up version of Bowser from Super Mario 64. \nSoldiers/Civilians/Scients - Koopa Troopas \nHeads are now different expressions to make use of the Random Head system, hats/helmets are replaced with tiny models & Bounding Boxes of 0 because they would get hit first despite being inside the head. Thought about making them sunglasses, but it'd still get hit first before the back of the head did and overall was unfairly annoying. \nMishkin/Donkey Kong is no longer the Defense Minister, that role now goes to May Day/Pauline with Donkey Kong being the Head of Special Forces. This was done to give Pauline a role in the story, as well as explain why the \"Great Guards\" use DK's body. \nDr Doak is now Oddjob/Toad to give him some sort of role in the story, as a result the idea of Toad \"blending in\" with the other scientists is ridiculous.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2InaPLqFd6g","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154564,"FileName":"0be04342-8770-4fe8-bf6a-c9c763afcca3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":154564,"FileName":"8a8f835f-2ecd-496c-94d5-02644d7003cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":154564,"FileName":"38efd95d-58d3-4b2d-8152-30ff4c198276.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177951,"Name":"GoldenEye X","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An enhanced version of the original GoldenEye 007 on the N64, modding Rare's First-Person follow-up Perfect Dark.

His mission; to gather intelligence on a wealthy entrepeneur named Auric Goldfinger. The investigation will take 007 around the globe and back again, in twenty brand new levels that faithfully recreate the film, as well as previous entries into the series as bonus material. Tour the famous Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, drive through the Alps in a classic Aston Martin, sneak inside a shady export company compound in Mexico, and shoot your way into the gold rich vaults of Fort Knox using a vast arsenal of weaponry. Mow down the enemy like a true gangster with the Thompson machine gun, use stealth at a distance with the AR-7 sniper rifle, or ramp up the fire power with a devastating RPG launcher. And once you've foiled Goldfinger's plans to dominate the world's bullion market, sharpen your skills against friends (or foes!) in multiplayer mode. With eleven maps to compete in, a wide range of weapon loadouts, and a comprehensive character roster to choose from, you'll soon be finding yourself crammed back on the couch again in split-screen fever. A completely original musical score accompanies every stage, and due to the inclusion of the Expansion Pak, are lengthier than previously possible. This memory expanding device allows Goldfinger 64 to go farther than the original game it was built upon. A greater amount of image textures can be loaded into a level at one time, mission setups filled with even more content, and maps larger than ever before. This fan-made sequel to GoldenEye 007 aims to bring players an exciting experience, while representing perhaps the most beloved Bond film of all time with much due respect. So if you think you're up to the task of putting an end to Operation Grand Slam, grab your controller and pull up a chair. It's about time Bond was back on the job.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/5aJZgB8j3Gw","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"SubDrag","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2017-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":138606,"FileName":"e66dac2f-94c0-4c09-b94a-1ce1ce20b694.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138606,"FileName":"506b1493-4b37-4dc0-a3d8-93104c8a22ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138606,"FileName":"ef102c77-ebe5-4009-8148-f52ea183307f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1113,"Name":"GT 64: Championship Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"GT 64, short for Grand Tour 64, is a 3D racing game for the Nintendo 64.

The player can move in any direction, jump, crawl, climb, and shoot. The player must solve puzzles by disabling electronic weapons or through skillful manoeuvering.\nHowever, when battling a monster (called a \"biological weapon\" in Hybrid Heaven), the game switches to a completely different mode. The player is constrained to a small room and can no longer jump, crawl, or climb. The monster and the player move around for strategic position in the room. When they are close enough, and have built up enough energy, one or the other will decide to attack. At that point time freezes and a single round similar to a role-playing video game turn ensues: the attacker picks an attack from a list, the defender picks a defense, and the results are displayed.

There are several types of fish and there is a size-range within each type. The goal of the player is to catch the most and the largest fish possible as to compete in extra competitions such as quizzes. In order to have the greatest success in fishing, players must determine the most fruitful part of Lake Akahoshi given the weather conditions and the time of the day. The player is also able to select from a number of different lures that can be used to attract different species and different sizes of fish.\n\nA few changes have been made to give players a more in-depth playing experience. As such, support for a tackle-and-reel peripheral has been included to heighten gameplay realism. Force-feedback features have also been included to allow the controller (standard controller or tackle-and-reel) to vibrate realistically when a fish has been \"hooked.\"","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em0y0aHbF4","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2000-03-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"1b5710d0-1699-4da3-9581-8a4efd961a3c.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"f0f179fc-2cb0-4121-80fc-b5f2c27644ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"87de6994-0cbd-46d7-960a-b0544f143cd8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"af851a96-26b4-456c-8802-87cbfb70fa15.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"81195d29-a881-43dd-995a-99df33ad4b99.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"28f00ee2-ee15-4974-aecb-c5ae26615533.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"79fcdd70-bfeb-43bf-b71b-fa2ae4694168.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123150,"FileName":"82197887-990f-4537-9c71-844938739260.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":123150,"AlternateName":"Shigesato Itoi's No. 1 Bass Fishing!

Standard moves can be linked to combos and each character has a number of individual special moves that require specific button combinations to be used.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZN2SwtqkY","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Atari Games","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"6544fa0d-f1bc-4a8e-9f15-70d8106489bb.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"d401850b-c61e-4a5a-80a4-ef822873daf0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"a3bdda25-6d31-4a90-8e1b-07059ddc930b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"cd1c9e4b-54ef-4fe2-9cf0-1d16885d91b3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"db873d4d-9abd-4524-8725-af558e8b82b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"e6b7e027-5da7-4b1a-9b72-3bcd5077684c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"f6fd0d3a-1efe-4d69-88d2-51e2de93b3d3.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"e70aa4df-35c2-4b80-8253-2ba7ac3bdc82.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"bf047e79-ff9a-48d2-bead-f99289bb0dd8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"dc4f12d5-6e2c-4c4b-938a-54d94e2eb8b4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"846484ef-7497-488d-af1b-d10b6a7d2b4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"37ba20ae-95af-44cd-9cc1-ad921b0924e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1132,"FileName":"ab1e934f-f4de-4409-a0d9-ce7744903ad6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1133,"Name":"Madden Football 64","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Madden Football 64 is the first in Electronic Arts' Madden series to appear on the Nintendo 64. In terms of features, it is based closely on the PlayStation/Saturn version of Madden 98 (with the same playing modes and even menus) but there are two important differences: The N64 version does not have an NFL license, so there are generic team names without logos (there is an NFLPA license for real player names), and it is the first game in the series to feature fully polygonal graphics, for both stadiums and players.\n\nConsequently, Madden 64 was the most graphically advanced Madden game at the time of release. Visual features include 5000 frames of animation and a first-person HelmetCam view. AI adjusts during the game to the player's style. Creating, drafting and trading a full roster of players is possible.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atgb6uox86E","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Tiburon","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"cae3c34a-d5de-4785-9087-0d226df61c34.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"aaa5cb45-dda8-4bde-97c7-71a028c57131.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"b5ecf19e-1e32-42ad-973e-1cdc25c5e019.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"b7c63f26-ed46-4f79-9875-e789b94017b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"6f983598-0414-4062-a1c4-079f371e4c95.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"675512c5-211a-4a7c-94e7-1ad18bf4dd78.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"af6ce276-e875-4f69-b980-fe08dd4e0684.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"cbca2718-66e3-4d9d-91e6-d7751f8e2833.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"3c20fcd9-e7aa-4989-a2f1-9c0fdc1134d3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"0ed57d71-58a2-4bce-842d-cfa84a939bef.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"f9c58e35-796d-4a4b-9052-394d8561b087.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"475dd05a-6f9f-42d5-9224-4cbaa792fed3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"77d1315e-eb31-4316-8167-fe9657540612.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"8cfb3233-33b7-47ae-bd93-114525abab93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"ed0e48a1-92b6-462d-82c9-d872e8edf687.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1133,"FileName":"dbabac2d-d223-4dab-848c-b453c19713e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1134,"Name":"Madden NFL 2000","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The speed and power of NFL football!

The game's cartridge has two SmartMedia card slots in the top to import digital photos and other graphics. Pictures created in the game can be saved to the memory card and would work with any digital printing display located in many malls and large scale stores. The cards could even be sent away like any other film processing. The game is compatible with the N64 mouse, which came with Mario Artist: Paint Studio.\n\nEven in Japan, the game is widely unheard of, making it a very popular game amongst collectors, and the fact that it is the only game to use the Smart Media-ready cartridge makes it that much more sought after. The unique cartridge has a Model Number of NUS-023. To date, it is known to have had three Smart Media cards that were specially made for it in connection with video game themes; Sylvanian Families characters from the toy line, Bomberman, and Yoshi.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0hRK6LUTxo","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Tokyo Electron","Publisher":"Tokyo Electron","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"df5d9eb9-34f1-4c47-bdcc-e65a70e73977.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"b379519d-3c55-473f-9c45-624b26ba2e40.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"a04abf01-016d-4ae8-bd53-ac60ddef2c9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"af0c34a3-40ef-4af5-b322-18dc4fd633e4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"1ed5c71b-8f5a-4294-9ee6-1a4dc761ccba.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"f8239728-8af4-4b1c-bae0-1aa22bed6b69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"FileName":"764bc9e8-07dc-4167-8065-25243d6b9bee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":20515,"AlternateName":"Mario no Photopie","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20515,"AlternateName":"Mario's Photo Studio","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":42,"Name":"Mario Party","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tensions mount for Mario and pals as each declares himself to be the one true Super Star of Marioland.

It is also the last game of the series to have an arcade release. Eurocom (who had previously developed the Sega Saturn version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) later ported it to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color during 1998. An updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released exclusively for the Dreamcast the following year.\n\nThe gameplay system in Mortal Kombat 4 is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted Elder God Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm many years prior to the beginning of the series. The other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness from conquering all the realms.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_cTWumqmnM","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Eurocom","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"1998-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"4fa40c43-a90f-4988-a898-2423b51da21f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"8e1696b7-6dbd-4c75-b16e-db2433472708.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"ab139fa5-1e4c-4970-b710-3a3fea22d994.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"49516966-876f-4a47-ba5b-863defadcbc8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"f3c4fc12-c011-43fe-a6d2-3221b06e6ef5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"0b4e5635-e8c5-42fd-9eca-0b5bfa8c2c7d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"f030a6f8-2eed-4227-8db1-707cab686f54.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"93b28cf1-23ad-4bb1-8189-b5b3b36ee10a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"f575f780-7406-435c-a5e7-3914ee7e2cc9.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"3a0fd1e4-1c2b-4e82-a557-93709c1295ba.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"ec8ec745-c477-4d86-83e5-76f7df7be62f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"5fffef55-de4a-40a0-81ae-548257c87392.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"2f4ae736-1471-4dbf-bc05-419f0fc977fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"8e611e77-f3bc-43b3-88ab-ccb074ce0ac3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1147,"FileName":"d04aa990-7c52-4378-ab6a-ac9226142c86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1148,"Name":"Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is a story-driven fighting game that casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that occurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.\n\nGameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting environment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies.

The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmee5iwyIlk","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Genki","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseDate":"1997-07-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"2cfb01ca-fcef-4105-8e59-258e2318ad40.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"e9502809-656a-448f-bc16-78c3c3692841.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"a34ba0c5-997a-4082-8362-57aeafe7e10c.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"b1ed6c2d-0d51-4cc4-8ad6-06f3354584ce.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"bf189211-77de-4cfc-9889-8e17b31bd6da.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"6478a552-cab9-4eb4-9322-55929225ee5d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"fef51a62-374a-44d9-9040-8fb3f2fb9a5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"89635ce0-0182-406a-a914-e20317c6c8c3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"665f6d4b-bc87-49fc-bbeb-9cfd7a7bb5dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"82f5ae4d-3b0e-4691-8684-d438c7261c93.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"98535e1e-fdaa-46b7-820f-41583a2249e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"f0e7aa93-04d7-43f0-8bd7-b289768d1b6d.PNG","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"41a1fba0-ea38-45cc-aeff-8ef35163e636.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"156851a2-ebaf-4d1e-85e1-c5175cb4c77f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"f959dc91-06e7-42ea-b4f5-e53c2a314d1d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"23239aa5-5551-4f68-a604-b1edb5ed17a9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"75ba535f-ac4b-4fa9-b39a-4a6fa2bfcbae.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"846480d9-d0c8-41f8-9871-f9338d5213aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"83995ba9-f4f7-41b4-8bbe-00acd6787cf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1150,"FileName":"20716a2c-5208-41a3-aa5c-e3694afbde49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1151,"Name":"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Professor Pac learns that the witch, Mesmerelda, has seized control of the Enchanted Castle using black magic and from there is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity; Truth; Wisdom; Courage) to control the \"four wonders\" (areas of Pac-Land).

Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley.\n\nGameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopAKMCNn9k","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Kalisto","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"b1bb52f8-4ecd-4b83-811c-723db1a6d1be.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"9500edad-1d2e-46ba-b3ca-8729626fb84d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"15c924bf-5871-48bd-91ed-93d8a45c80f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"85905875-4b30-47fe-9d76-dad81fda3c28.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"2057b29c-1b37-4664-9f62-26b5a0e47c82.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"c1411119-3d58-4c44-b588-b869e36ba3ac.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"f5af8af9-0e0b-451f-abf5-165aedcccead.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"54f48430-9723-4632-8ee3-d2ec3379c49c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"b991d06a-ac55-43b3-aa8b-f1d884afdd73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"93afc86e-ea6a-4036-9cd5-554c8edf42ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"b59073fa-d597-4337-bd94-2e5e05462375.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1173,"FileName":"49e98c53-1b97-4d15-95f1-a114bc82bc6b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123074,"Name":"Nintama Rantarou 64 Game Gallery","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Nintama Rantarou is a series of video games, which were published exclusively in Japan.

To fish you need to find a suitable spot and after catching a fish you can keep it to a water tank and feed it.\n\nWhile walking random encounters can occur at any time in which you are transferred at a different screen and have the choice of either throwing stuff like rocks at the enemy to chase them away or run across a path-like bar to reach to safety and end the battle. If you choose to do the latter you are vulnerable as the enemy is able to attack you and have your health depleted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y0uPSOke_A","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Aisystem Tokyo","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"1bb40bb3-8c3a-40f9-a6b8-3e3989237c5c.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"3f374d3b-9260-421c-b3c4-f4ef5999e0c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"3c1e8d2b-43ce-4207-b3a7-8a16a04a1648.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"5c633e96-8175-4300-8f0a-ee7906b0c3fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"e5b40848-24fb-4490-8a63-1d7d439d5e36.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"f6669996-3ee8-40a7-8124-a9a163f35d17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"5be3a70c-6f1d-4ebe-aa3b-0eb7319d4239.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"52db8e03-1087-4c27-83f6-d74e8006ba6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123077,"FileName":"6c73fb82-597a-4a23-848b-7303c209d676.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":123077,"AlternateName":"Nushi Zuri 64","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":123079,"Name":"Nushi Tsuri 64: Shiokaze Ninotte","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Like the predecessor, this ecological tale lets players choose from four different characters, each with a slightly different quest.

Originally dubbed a “Pokémon clone”, it is in fact closer to games such as Digimon World or Monster Rancher for the PlayStation.\n\nThe player character is a child who starts a journey to become a monster breeder on his tenth birthday. After receiving and hatching an egg, the player walks around the world, completing requests from people and raising monsters. Requests are basic RPG quests—such as collecting an item for a non-playable character—and the monsters fight in Pokémon-style, turn-based battles. Unlike Pokémon, every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, the monster gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters level up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/FUMlUI_p6B0?t=26","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Bottom Up","Publisher":"Bottom Up","ReleaseDate":"1999-04-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"251d5db9-32a7-4e16-a28e-94dd2f553868.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"a62dc3cf-73bc-489d-be3a-52a9150f48e0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"badaf6a2-137f-4edc-bc97-1fa4fbad0eb4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"66aaeac9-df68-4f3b-b183-c687c83ae3d1.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"0256c2b4-6f10-4e52-857a-fccdde518b4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"035d3ea4-98ad-4497-8c83-c620149a190d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31699,"FileName":"b62eab4a-b8b3-47b5-8a99-045da09984c7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123092,"Name":"Pachinko 365 Nichi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pachinko game from SeTa, which was released only in Japan.\n\nThe game includes three game modes.

The game, endorsed by Kevin Keegan, lets you take over the manager's reins of a soccer club in any of the English Leagues, be it the Premier League or the low lights of the Third Division. But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job.

Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.\n\nThis version of the game have different music and lacks the voiced cutscenes due to cartridge's memory limitations, but can be played in 4-player mode like the Dreamcast version and included a Transfer Pack mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RifH3JGuvHg","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"629015f8-75a7-48be-8bc0-7f7e584593f1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"75e4a47d-611d-4088-a59b-2a17f2a5a9a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"9f83e92c-d66e-432e-8661-2f99ae79acdc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"0623a8f4-9d7d-46d6-a93a-ff8deb9b2214.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"f1dc2196-9e32-4842-8c25-b063cfacc774.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"deb09d51-c33d-4102-8679-8ba327927aca.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"404c3592-94dd-4d81-abe2-9dad461e8a8c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"367e78d8-ff5a-43df-b2e1-d2f9d185864d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"711c0b1f-5333-4722-8f65-1e772714f396.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27817,"FileName":"127f26a6-3b65-44c1-aee6-8d1260782eef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":27817,"AlternateName":"Puyo Puyoon Party","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27817,"AlternateName":"Puyo Puyo~n Party","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":23759,"Name":"Puyo Puyo Sun 64","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Puyo Puyo SUN (ぷよぷよSUN Puyopuyo San?) is the third installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo Tsu, made in 1996 by Compile.

As you'd expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a 'crayon meter' that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating special move.\n\nAn interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using \"Training Mode\". In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in 'Battle Mode'. This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you've trained enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DbU5zNjG3w","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"KCE Kobe","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1998-07-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"39b4ef89-383d-43ba-ae79-8cb2d0a9edb3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"5640179a-2519-47b7-a33c-46573e0f945b.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"e03f964f-b89d-4e92-a1df-77d976d5a3ed.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"15a8092f-4005-429e-b5ea-1ceef2539647.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"a55e460c-4c81-421e-a9ac-1d28586b855a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"3cd34098-2812-48bd-a94e-17a0adb5585f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"c7f4edf5-828c-49ae-8eee-bfb7c169c572.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"43fadba8-3117-401e-be4a-e614e50f0d9a.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"3cda8734-c901-40c1-88ac-c602bf792990.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"1c70a3d0-93dd-417a-b2f7-75ffedfe2f3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"437e419b-ddc5-4516-b63f-1719b5cf266c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"66140a2a-4628-432b-824f-32a86133dbfe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"268e0600-5897-47df-9d52-519c0b91815f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1186,"FileName":"2cd1177c-4d97-4a35-957e-63cdca44f8c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":1186,"AlternateName":"Rakuga Kids","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":1187,"Name":"Rally Challenge 2000","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"RALLY CHALLENGE 2000 takes you on a scorching tour around the world.

He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings.

The high-tech theme-park would be opening tomorrow. How much Rocket, the maintenance robot, wanted to go and see it he could not even tell, but the professor barely noticed. Then it happened. Jojo the raccoon, sick of playing second banana to the insipid Whoopy the walrus, stole all of the tokens, tickets, and Whoopy. There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone.\n\nRocket: Robot on Wheels is a 3D platformer like no other. It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, real-time physics. As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again. The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose. In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game. The real-time physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdvP__uBBwE","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sucker Punch","Publisher":"Ubi Soft","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"da1b2038-cd4f-4a90-bea4-b8dc6aa2ed45.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"698d015b-f927-480e-a06c-3c5ca6d16867.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"db1c74e6-0a33-4a10-b8a5-0ab3f3911558.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"1a11a817-8459-4ea8-802a-f736a2e6a208.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"d14f78a0-8bbc-40bc-be2c-5fa966f99ebd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"9cd81c8d-b208-472a-a812-b5f600328fdb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"f7a30d68-b2e1-4f7a-a23b-fd4e99529330.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"7b5d7767-f102-4c7f-b816-f46bd71efd2b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"9eef61bd-d981-468a-9bd7-f38aca84ec02.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"6961714a-30bb-4f0a-8fa2-249f90f2e1a1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"985363d3-54f4-40e9-88a8-be719fd923a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"0e6c5d5f-a850-4039-9f0c-21ea9d03d8ed.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"38896802-88e7-43f0-912c-e49fd47a3324.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"e30c50b0-36cd-4aec-b5eb-c01d6d23355f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1194,"FileName":"57e5ad6c-3bf7-4f14-99ea-a2d9e09ee63a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167831,"Name":"Ronaldinho Soccer 64","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"This is a rare ROM hack of the popular \"International Superstar Soccer 64\" from peruvian group \"Twin Eagles Group\", the same creators of \"Campeonato Brasileiro 96\", \"Ronaldinho Soccer 97\" and \"Ronaldinho Soccer 98\" for the SNES.

In \"The Pirate Treasure Hunt,\" the babies travel underwater in search of items; \"Angelica's Temple of Gloom\" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and \"Reptar Rally\" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck19Wd5JyMg","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Realtime Associates Seattle Division","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"1999-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"156eb1ca-b115-4625-9992-64b9422c5dbe.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"9b7e350e-dd46-42c8-95de-00697dcf3e7f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"94534635-58b7-4249-bcbd-8d221ea830cb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"e11532c3-aeab-4c06-b85b-6e53e3c0ac38.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"e482f87e-4af8-466c-b26e-e5b858c10fec.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"da993cff-53d1-45cc-b8be-88d9929c9004.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"f3ee27c1-e894-449f-aa07-12437f18008f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"32059de1-0b0a-492f-a316-706a769a0d8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"b76accf8-04ec-4b37-85f4-4688e054fbd4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"752edca8-680a-432f-a77a-efc4f669ff85.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"a0540415-0ff0-4724-8f7a-1e30c13e8d15.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"fa1ce7b5-259b-4511-a91e-5312dbe03f96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"c091d866-4f14-45fe-935f-a6d5fc711252.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"5ec778bf-c336-44a2-8593-fed0466ad1a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"64cdc76a-2172-44c4-9f3a-b5f3ef61f24f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"2b6a9d5b-b6a3-44cf-80f1-b95a0b6b9ed0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1196,"FileName":"a2fbaf8f-bbdf-4566-a967-68cc8a407efd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":1196,"AlternateName":"Les Razmoket: La Chasse aux Trésors","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"AlternateName":"Rugrats: Treasure Hunt","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1196,"AlternateName":"Rugrats: Die grosse Schatzsuche","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":1197,"Name":"Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Performance...

The game features a futuristic representation of San Francisco and an arcade-style physics engine. It also features a multiplayer mode for up to four players and Rumble Pak support on the Nintendo 64 port. A major difference in game play compared to predecessors in the series is the ability to extend wings from the cars in midair and glide.\n\nAs with previous titles in the franchise, Rush 2049 features a stunt mode in which the player scores points for complex mid-air maneuvers and successful landings.

The player takes control of Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Stan to fight through the town in a first-person perspective.\n\nSingle player takes the form of a \"Story\" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels. The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight. Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls. Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this. The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps. The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.\n\nA multiplayer mode lets players take characters and weapons they unlock in Story mode into small deathmatch arenas. The N64 version supports 4 players. Players can set standard victory options like knockouts or time limits. Voice samples for multiplayer are also included, so the characters will make comments and taunts when hit.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQATXrE6F34","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Iguana Entertainment","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"7b0337d0-782a-443b-9012-0f5a54c1eec7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"1fdc1780-60e6-46a3-ad13-3e1264a865e5.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"83e02b4e-6706-4935-846b-fe15067e951b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"6e45f90a-9a29-4db3-9075-dd8524403974.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"5e7ec038-cc7b-4b0f-bdfb-f0d8a692dad4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"99816d0a-5327-40c6-b3d6-5b92e9c17022.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"3cfc903a-89ca-4e51-a3a1-fe0bfb2c3316.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"38be1a86-294f-4fad-98b9-327569f20b9c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"d42e0fe5-ea93-4558-9f54-fe0eec607580.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"9fafe33f-d6de-4a0f-b103-777628368b7a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"e43ee8e1-e27b-49c2-9f72-99504d802c6a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"aa57c85d-2f82-4fa1-9cb0-a6ed8bf66be1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"2ce22783-ec83-4793-864b-0d87e8152abf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"6eff71ae-5eb6-4c31-ae22-9312f9e05d0f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"c7344cae-9c00-4b48-bf80-ebb5ee050d1d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1204,"FileName":"3dac46b5-0f5d-4c1a-9cfd-7699e919514f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":399,"Name":"South Park Rally","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Choose your character from the cast of the popular 'mature' cartoon South Park, and tear through the streets in this racing game.

Dash encounters several wampas on the way, and has to fight an AT-ST, but eventually makes it back to Leebo and The Outrider, and they escape through an asteroid field.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx9CjhfUQLw","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"LucasArts","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"5181d5f8-9a1b-4708-b9bc-0d13ba29056a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"923b892f-63f5-4236-b7d3-8c4ff1bdec06.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"6d62ecf1-9881-490d-beff-330d446733fe.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"0d2912cc-ca40-4a05-8fc1-cd23fb2fc9fe.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"37de1591-3598-4d17-8d67-95cdf5d56af6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"b6b3dbe6-257c-4a82-8bd2-e5eb98b7fb98.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"408c5f42-4bf8-4374-aab1-080b35f8288d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"c1385ffe-593f-4c93-a680-e9674e13faba.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"1dc59c15-8eca-4aad-8571-ce29e49a723f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"a30b6c13-80d7-47eb-b0b5-04989388a1cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"0e297985-5ff9-4c0f-b9f7-f23688ebf43b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"c4d1e75f-873a-4ce5-81bb-98168dc77888.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"4503f388-b0bd-42e6-9901-f953123abe7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"8389efd6-8209-48c1-b5dc-d6d88cf43073.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"35fd1c7b-a89f-4c64-b9bb-f9fa331b8c58.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"104584d9-846c-4ce7-84c8-8e457a7f365f.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"83508311-d69a-4da7-8d63-6544430aef2a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"81bbad9c-e4b2-40fd-b450-63860fd1781c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"8014947f-70ca-4d7e-b6fa-bad65ad366da.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"e3126621-f3f3-481a-a559-a64a36375b49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"c1a4951c-c194-46b6-afff-7010f099ec6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":231,"FileName":"13a607db-b87b-48cb-a9e2-0780204ace46.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":231,"AlternateName":"Star Wars: Teikoku no Kage","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":1207,"Name":"StarCraft 64","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for their survival on the edge of the universe.

It basically consists of various mini games which all have the goal to hit various things with the marbles. To do so, a crosshair has to be moved over the screen to mark the goal. Examples for the mini games are a billiard or a \"Whack-a-mole\" variant. Besides this there is also a battle mode available in which up to four opponents walk over one of four areas and try to shoot the others over the edge. Those battles are either the scenario for three additional single-player tournaments or multiplayer.

He soon learns from Toad that Bowser has once again kidnapped her. The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach.\n\nSuper Mario 64 is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining access to various parts of Bowser's castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which contain more areas.\n\nMario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps and backflips can be executed as well. Swimming underwater now depletes Mario's oxygen level. Items must be picked up and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles.\n\nPower-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high areas.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QwCjJ_8BQI","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E -

Although it's not quite as popular as Star Road, The Green Stars is an excellent game for players just getting into ROM hacks.\n\nThe game is intended as a sequel to Super Mario 64, and also makes references to Super Mario Galaxy. Once again, Bowser has stolen the stars and used their power to create an army of monsters and kidnap Princess Peach. The Toads built a rocket to take Mario to Bowser, but Bowser locked it before Mario could get there, so the rocket serves as the first key-door of the game. The ending cutscene is the same as in the original game, though with minor changes. \n\nAlso listed in the credits for hacking and help are Kaze Emanuar, Frauber, and VL-Tone.\n\nNot related to Super Mario 64: The Green Comet","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/vXapDMDTlvI","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Kampel125","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163203,"FileName":"0cac2137-7f47-4eb7-91d7-5a7cc2c4fd02.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163203,"FileName":"187a4592-292c-4ac9-bdc4-78e21ed9b082.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163203,"FileName":"11c5330b-29c7-4e40-b239-0a988e59c8a2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163203,"FileName":"e2057ec7-1c2b-42df-8a67-323dfd1c7e88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163203,"FileName":"3a3c6751-bc1c-4525-9f21-443e5f5fbb50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163203,"FileName":"21bddc99-c9ac-46c5-847d-be0ca9fd9801.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":163203,"AlternateName":"SM64: The Green Stars","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":153064,"Name":"Super Mario 74","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Lugmillord","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-06-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153064,"FileName":"1f9434ab-9951-4aa2-825e-f74c6fe9703e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":153064,"FileName":"089cd68a-3bc0-4512-99a4-bb5f26a241ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143597,"Name":"Super Mario Odyssey 64","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Modder, Kaze Emanuar released Super Mario 64 ‘demake’ of Super Mario Odyssey for the Nintendo 64.

The background story is basically about an mysterious force attacking Earth and the robot pilots battle it out to determine who fights the evil robots in the end. How the story plays out in detail depends on which of the seven characters is used in story mode. The selectable characters are the protagonists' mecha from the series Daitarn 3, Dancougar, G Gundam, Dunbine, Xabungle and Voltes V plus the R-1 from Shin Super Robot Taisen. By meeting certain conditions while playing, three more characters can be unlocked, including one that makes its debut in this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself follows the genre standards: both opponents can perform a set of standard and special attacks (the latter executed with certain button combinations). Every hit causes the energy bar to go down and whoever runs out first, loses. When a timer runs out, the one with the most energy left wins. Each fighter also has a second energy meter which can be used to perform especially powerful attacks. The robots also can fly which changes the available attack range. The playing modes are story, vs (two players), 64 (same as story mode without the story), Guts (fighting one opponent after another until the energy runs out), time attack (defeating opponents in a short time) and training.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/zcIUnGhlfts?t=30","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Banpresto","Publisher":"Banpresto","ReleaseDate":"1998-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"9e0866b0-ae9c-43f8-83f1-b4b68ef2318e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"1a8e5f89-c79b-4381-863e-2b1cb22c7cdb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"f6e2cfba-791d-451e-8a03-a3c356f9af3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"e2fc323a-b9e9-418f-9a40-0145a462bfeb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"fef8f4ac-0db5-42f5-9c81-0a8f272cb0c4.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"1d985497-a657-4fd5-b869-e7544732194f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"ced8e8db-6617-42e3-b641-b453c21efa15.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"46f03952-d0b0-4ae0-b755-e8fcbdbb12e4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133117,"FileName":"d7c131a9-d5ea-45bd-8fa7-a7e2a08926a2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32095,"Name":"Super Robot Wars 64","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The basic concept remains unchanged in this N64 installment of the series - it's a turned based strategy game where the player commands robots and pilots from various Japanese shows, for example Dancouga and different Gundam series, as well as Banpresto originals.

With the different variations included, there are over 100 missions.\n\nDuring the stages, the player moves his units over a map, attacking enemies and using special abilities. When getting attacked, player units may defend, counter, or attempt to evade, resulting in no damage at all if successful. Destroyed enemies give experience and money for upgrading between the missions. Often, scripted events happen, such as reinforcements arriving. Sometimes it's also possible to persuade certain characters to join the player's side, in addition to those that join automatically. Certain, otherwise unobtainable units, can also be unlocked by using the N64 Transfer Pak in combination with the Gameboy Color game Super Robot Wars: Link Battler.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Monegi","Publisher":"Banpresto","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"2b48b686-3889-4a3f-be07-3fcf1fa44f42.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"8ba3f62a-7608-48b0-8003-9ede0e24b5fe.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"95fb8449-060d-4a56-bacf-454da9cdffe5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"4296da7e-ebb4-4876-a8ed-252dc748b231.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"b2842f0f-dcea-4315-b266-57f6052f588c.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"961027d8-8a25-45ba-9609-7d493f7cc830.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"ed00c3fb-8ae7-4730-92bc-c35b4d1e7a7a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32095,"FileName":"edcb6490-627b-4906-b001-7936a1592123.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":32095,"AlternateName":"Super Robot Taisen 64","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":404,"Name":"Super Smash Bros.","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super Smash Bros. takes familiar Nintendo characters such as Mario, Kirby and Donkey Kong, and gets them to fight to the death.

It was released only in Japan in 1998 despite the whole game being in English. It is the only Nintendo 64 game that can make use of the Nintendo 64's bio sensor which was included with the game.\n\nThe game itself offers the traditional Tetris experience: Blocks enter the screen from the top of the screen and can be moved and rotated as long as they are falling. The goal is to create full lines which then disappear, reward points and cause the game to become more difficult over time. The game is lost when the appearing stone can't be moved anymore because the screen is full. B-Type is similar but the screen gets filled with random block combinations from the ground.\n\nIn addition to this standard mode, the game features two unique variants: In \"Giga Tetris\" the player occasionally has to deal with huge blocks which break up when touching the ground. \"Bio Tetris\" makes use of the bio sensor accessory: it is clipped into the user's ear and measures the heart rate. It can be set if the game slows down or speeds up when the heart rate rises.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cE3gR6lo6w","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Amtex","Publisher":"SETA","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"b15d8adb-7c61-4fb1-b68d-b8dabf8ee3d0.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"54d9f60d-674a-4c24-a82c-009bdb5b5696.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"b1ad0593-ce6d-4410-a67c-da6a8353c17f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"d73be31b-7f6a-468c-81e6-7b0d66df8c13.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"1bb400aa-e2c8-4d44-9ecd-2a23f14ffab5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"34df8252-377e-4b8d-b9cd-83812776b461.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"aca9fb70-9b50-4ac4-a0a5-0eaccdf949fd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"2a8ba985-209f-4b38-8095-b633bb66dac4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"9649cb2e-7bbc-4f7a-b972-02f8395d6fda.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"0a0b7c1b-d76b-4e82-9d4d-59ad09b97054.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20517,"FileName":"712d3d18-75a8-4b2d-ab0e-8d0a14713aa8.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":405,"Name":"Tetrisphere","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"What would you do if your friends were trapped at the core of a sphere layered in hundreds of Tetris pieces?

The twist here, though, is that these environments are full, extensive, recreations of Hyrule from Ocarina of Time loaded with in-jokes from Nintendo's storied past.\n\nThe game is lovingly made, with detail and charm to spare. For example, the music consists of classic Zelda compositions but remade with Banjo-Kazooie's instrument set. Absolutely inspired! That's the kind of touch usually reserved for official collaborations like Cadence of Hyrule. Death Mountain, Kakariko Village, The Lost Woods, Kokiri Forest — they're all here and gorgeously remade and tweaked to fit the new style of gameplay. You'll travel to nine worlds with 100 Jiggies, 900 musical notes, countless eggs, Jinjos, Honeycomb pieces and more, all the while stumbling onto Easter Eggs that I can't in good conscience spoil for you.

It was initially released in April 2009 and contains 38 Stars.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, it is relatively straightforward, and in terms of length, it is quite short and not very cryptic. It is also one of the most unique hacks, making use of a large number of interesting and unique gimmicks in every one of its \"levels\". The format of the hack is also different, as most of the stars are not found in standard courses, but in small overworld areas. These areas are all large, flat areas with objects such as platforms put into them, which Mario or Luigi must traverse to reach Stars or coins.\n\nThis hack strives on changes during gameplay and progression through the hack. Oddly, the camera seems to focus on the center of the level when on Lakitu Cam, so using the Mario perspective is recommended. Beware that the various pipes and sections will change the camera. On a side note, the character selection and the final boss both require use of the directional pad, specifically the left and right inputs; because of this, you may need to ensure that you have these controls mapped.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_3j7d5E1N8","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Frauber","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":174296,"FileName":"3140cf33-d2af-49f1-887f-e7fba6144f18.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":174296,"FileName":"b437d40c-f5bb-49cc-819c-5ab87a7ddb42.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174296,"FileName":"6cc32769-315d-4293-aa32-2acb4c3f60d4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174296,"FileName":"9dacf637-242a-448a-9ec0-4672fc8ddc0a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1161,"Name":"The New Tetris","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"With special new moves, additional ways to score, and room for up to 4 players simultaneously, this already habit-forming classic will have you absolutely addicted!

This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. \n\nThe third title in the Turok series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.\n\nTurok 2's multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YREBIIE7eUk","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Acclaim Studios Austin","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2000-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"ea33f2ce-5b50-4996-a9b9-4aaadf9ea0eb.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"62073bde-1838-41fd-8c71-fb36e8125f3c.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"9b71edee-6537-4624-acaf-0f19d6603c32.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"c5a4424d-f5ec-4f7f-9fa1-01a806f07992.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"6a9192d4-787f-4bbc-bcb7-47f48c052537.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"2d6410f1-d69c-463a-98dd-b3152358f8ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"e60af9ef-9cf1-4ac3-b723-c3a8acb75c49.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"6bffa9c4-2f63-4bb5-8f3f-3251b8d0f08e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"ec664d28-82fa-4ac1-8aa7-75a77e201d5e.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"7297fa0b-6974-4335-8b90-668ed48dddd8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"250766e1-2d69-4250-833c-711625a75bd6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"1c5dfe04-2221-48cf-a1b8-b2f7c70cafc7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"44ac7945-9b74-4f9d-b1b1-5a5d20c14e84.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"bdc8c647-5831-4283-8035-a26b0af40a38.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1226,"FileName":"3af208f2-c30d-49dd-bd43-091987d2bf91.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":68,"Name":"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is a first-person shooter with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements.

It was a sequel to the original Viewpoint which released in 1992.\n\nViewpoint 2064’s first known announcement was in August 1999, when Nintendo announced their Space World August 1999 lineup. The game was playable at both Space World and the September 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In Nintendo’s Space World guide book, it was given a half page advertisement and was listed as 100% complete, set for a November 11th, 1999 release date for ¥7,800.\n\nWhen IGN64 did their Space World 1999 coverage, on August 27th, 1999, they reported that Sammy was in talks with several International publishers, but that no US release date was currently planned. Despite being listed as 100% complete Viewpoint 2064 was not simply delayed to Q1 2000, but disappeared completely soon after the show with some magazines and websites stating it had been canned. However, a year later on August 14th, 2000, IGN reported that Viewpoint 2064 was scheduled to appear at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show and was set for a November 24th release date. It was listed on the organisation’s Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) website, also with a release date of November 24th, 2000, for a then undecided price.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsutaya, a chain of book and video rental stores, posted Viewpoint 2064 for sale on their website. This listing had a release date of November 17th, 2000, some preliminary box art, and a description of the game. All this information makes it likely that other retailers had been informed about the upcoming release as well, but Viewpoint 2064 did not hit this date, and by 2001 the game had been quietly cancelled.\n\nOut of all of the versions of Viewpoint that were released, Viewpoint 2064 was the only one that was developed as a true sequel, with entirely different levels, mechanics, graphics, progression, and a story. \n\nNo official reason for cancellation was given.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZdpC-vZe5U","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Racdym","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"57f2034d-b853-4790-b1ee-9f9322e14f30.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"1dce9e9c-fb4a-44b3-8a41-2131f93f5972.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"08f20821-7bcb-433c-b82f-459151ac5baf.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"1daa0815-60be-4563-aa47-157668f17a93.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"3fc40a8a-ba5d-460c-a566-60072a67dab9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"f3ab1a8d-bbd9-457e-b9ca-5eaa105280d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"3f429f7c-0e62-41f0-bb04-76d10cef350e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"bb909b61-6eae-4a96-a131-aed88eee4682.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177125,"FileName":"af4340aa-e327-4dfc-992b-c06bb817826a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":964,"Name":"Vigilante 8","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Vigilante 8 is a vehicular combat game similar to Twisted Metal in concept. Players can choose from eight characters with different agendas, and select vehicles ranging from classic 1970's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with various kinds of weapons. Unlockables include two hidden levels (three in the Nintendo 64 version) and five hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer is also included: the Nintendo 64 version allows four players to go head-to-head.\n\nThe game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. An organization known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage everywhere except in the United States. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by five hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the country to its knees. When gas prices went wild, six civilians who called themselves Vigilantes, led by the truck driver Convoy, began fighting against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzHBoJzuOSQ","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":"Luxoflux","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"9f43b127-08c6-4352-b57b-cfd79b9dba60.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"f52ad745-23fe-44a6-9700-45842e93ba7e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"fd04d8d5-8121-4fa9-bda3-e465aea42c1d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"447d3d6e-3c15-4ef3-9450-66ea0fc671b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"5c4d349b-bbab-41e8-b956-592aad12f311.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"aeaf68d7-6c6f-4885-b350-d4fac532058f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"8403c446-3e40-4bb0-9060-c2bd0b30f39b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"7f756861-5e30-4587-a866-14b6ed70bb09.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"850fe97b-4c8e-4513-aeb5-f658f65fdd34.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"ac7b7b75-c615-4edc-88df-76b851058088.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"693eedfa-cff7-4ea2-a412-b0eb0e4dfe6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"019007d2-418c-4f9c-82df-89434aaf846b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"d711e4cd-79e5-4443-8a43-51a834870250.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":964,"FileName":"337ce864-3199-4995-ab9f-ad18d2720606.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":409,"Name":"Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"More drivin' & blastin' fun in this sequel to Vigilante 8.

The game features wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling, but also includes generic renditions of wrestlers from major Japanese promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, a feature that would continue following the release of the sequel Virtual Pro Wrestling 2.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"AKI Corporation","Publisher":"Asmik Ace Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"378f3450-4ffe-4ade-b86f-7e657351a0bc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"0629d617-8845-4f5c-84cc-9a6fd07a635e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"5c533e5e-66d1-492c-af3b-a4edede210a4.PNG","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"d199d66b-aa80-4895-a202-a576aeff765c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"f056b05c-30df-42ef-9ef9-cffc29457897.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"f5950abf-0c94-4ead-bc3c-42cfa43299bf.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"f3e2eb02-8030-4ddc-a732-59334bad0d75.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"e38382a4-ec08-4e9b-8abc-7efa4a2aeb4e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"652bca6e-9318-4f6a-9254-573b8a9a4ec9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"8139844d-62bb-453d-9afc-ac588a009c3a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"5cc02b31-5de3-4316-badb-050231f34960.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31084,"FileName":"df2642ae-e120-40fa-9ef2-1c9191fb2721.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1230,"Name":"V-Rally Edition 99","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Racing insanity!

Failure to pass the buoys, on the other hand, leads to decrease in speed and eventually disqualification.\n\nGame modes include Warm Up (basically a training session in a course known as Dolphin Park); Time Trials, in which players race against time; Championship, in which players compete in a tournament, choosing one of the four available difficulty levels; and Stunt Mode, where performing various stunts awards players with point. A two-player split-screen versus mode is available as well.

Five different gameplay modes, including Arcade, Time Trial, Championship, Finals and Versus Battle were planned for the game.\n\nSome months later, on May 2000, Looking Glass Studios went out of business during a financial crisis related to their publisher at the time, Eidos Interactive. Wildwaters / Extreme Kayak vanished forever, along with their other promising N64 racing game, Mini Racers.\n\nThere was another cancelled water racing game titled “Wild Water World Championships” that was planned for the Nintendo 64, but it should not be confused with this one as WWWC was developed by Promethean Designs.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing; Sports","Developer":"Looking Glass Studios","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95725,"FileName":"ddaf0cb5-4bbf-4631-9d35-5b91b9a21a7a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95725,"FileName":"0d78d3ef-05f4-457c-9f36-24c7e989c140.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95725,"FileName":"f37e1ebc-88d5-4e92-aea6-61f66d88fbc5.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95725,"FileName":"09e77af8-21cf-4917-ae85-d3de55ccfe50.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":413,"Name":"WinBack: Covert Operations","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A terrorist group calling itself the Crying Lions is about to take over the world with its mighty satellite and Jean-Luc Cougar is the only one who can stop it.

All maps, music and dungeons are custom-made. It presents the conclusion of a past war between two half of a same kingdom, the Dawnside of the east and the Duskside of the west. It is a completed romhack and lasts about two to three hours on a first playthrough.\n\nThe (successful) goal of the romhack was to produce a game that could play on Nintendo 64 Disk Drive and actually use features of this extra hardware for the Nintendo 64. LuigiBlood was responsible for porting Dawn & Dusk to Nintendo 64 Disk Drive. Many other members of the Hylian Modding community also contributed to development of the game.\n\nThe gameplay part of the game is preceded by a war between the Dawnside and Duskside. The Duskside had discovered a powerful creature and tried to tame its strength. However, the monster dragged the Duskside into attacking the Dawnside and so followed a war. After heavy damage was sustained by the Dawnside, a priestess used her power to repel the monster back to the Dawnside. The priestess' descendants were trained to protect the Dawnside if ever trouble were to arise again from the other half of the kingdom.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Captain Seedy-Eye","Publisher":"GitHub","ReleaseDate":"2019-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175056,"FileName":"1b31932c-fcd3-4202-bb57-414b8e2f8e92.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":175056,"FileName":"b590effd-40a2-438c-84d8-94ba7da09bfd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":175056,"FileName":"1b35dcc9-e006-42ba-9c46-a7c8912e7c90.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":175056,"FileName":"bca38ee1-bec2-4c78-912d-37916ba26662.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":101834,"Name":"Zool: Maju Tsukai Densetsu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zool: Maju Tsukai Densetsu (ズール 魔獣使い伝説) is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo 64.
