After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.\n\nDiddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the \"Silver Coin Challenge\". In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).\n\nThe game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.\n\nUp to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1997-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XXvzvNZYOjc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diddy_Kong_Racing"},"216":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Chaoji Maliao 64","Region":"China"},{"Name":"Shen You Mario","Region":"China"},{"Name":"Shenyou Maliou","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action;

He soon learns from Toad that Bowser has once again kidnapped her. The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach.\n\nSuper Mario 64 is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining access to various parts of Bowser's castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which contain more areas.\n\nMario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps and backflips can be executed as well. Swimming underwater now depletes Mario's oxygen level. Items must be picked up and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles.\n\nPower-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high areas.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9QwCjJ_8BQI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Mario_64"},"228":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams Entertainment, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"88db804c-c18a-4077-837c-dd67012b6bbc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"22593799-0a76-44ce-b3c8-6cfe4fd0f84e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8fb8e37e-30de-4a90-96da-5f782f114e7b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9cca61db-29a5-4fa3-b5c1-852b2ed23faa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a3dc7513-4d88-48de-8f12-cd39fa2c090e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"db4b7aba-34ea-4b6b-94ad-c327a555c30a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7d40ab1-b429-4f85-ae0b-d655c1ddb25c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2ab5833e-8b3b-40ac-8949-5116e450bb2e.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"db8a0545-3bc2-4d03-8a09-fc549b77aeb5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7a62ebb2-1c75-4c17-8b32-08abb36f42af.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e89573c3-35e0-4680-9216-1b7945207751.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f8439a70-4096-4b9a-8123-30ed0ee9679f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2de0a499-f2bc-47ed-afbc-e58bed39a7f0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a8417200-9ca5-4925-aaad-04a93b4fa881.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Cruis'n USA","Overview":"Like in most racing games, players race down one-way courses consisting of streets vaguely based on real-life locations. While racing, they do their best to avoid various road hazards such as oncoming traffic and construction. Players chose between seven different cars to race with. As in most racing games, the car can simulate either an automatic or manual transmission. Automatic increases the speed of gear shifts, while players using the manual transmission must switch during races. Players who reach first place move on to the next track, like in most racing games. Unlike most racing games, there is the option to change the music by pressing the music button.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fG_V5YRG5C0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cruis'n_USA"},"229":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eurocom","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"5ecb4f9a-cad4-489b-95a5-60b156a9f043.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"223b8e6a-c2dd-472e-9824-8174b3e34b15.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"72bbaab5-1454-40ae-8146-130b8a43b525.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4ed0718e-e4a9-400e-ba3f-5541f12df04a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7d19b31b-82e1-4099-8a8b-9cbf3ba82b60.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f4cd948a-cfd9-4f0b-82e0-b1ebc3b26ea4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1abf15c4-93bc-4d4b-b90d-4d47420d7593.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b094d8c-03f9-4a19-81c9-a88ce9ecb3f2.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"9edf87fb-94df-4b6a-8f30-a09a65d77b78.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5485d905-b335-437c-9b3e-b02d819d85e8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b4e75963-9a27-4902-9f63-7cf6598a8f2d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"68030182-0c4b-4e6c-a93f-ebe6d2e68a0d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0e9cbad8-e350-4f06-adcd-d0d355fcdf00.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"00fad5da-d5c3-4186-8db1-af76dcd78601.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cb92b6dc-6322-4a0a-81d7-f8c08c1aa4ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Cruis'n World","Overview":"While Cruis'n USA takes the player on a trip across the highways of America, Cruis'n World leads them to race all around the world.

Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.\n\nThroughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1999-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hl5-qgyU-Z8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Bug%27s_Life_(video_game)"},"240":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"3DO","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"03b1155d-35c6-491a-85ad-0023844e53f4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"47bf4f03-1f62-4180-b59e-855b20fb275f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"689be44a-776a-47d0-ae32-3709714f6aa5.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7fb752ed-cb1d-42c5-8f95-6d1c8c6ecbb9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"92b59428-3d02-4651-b5d4-ec36a99aa5a8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3a3768b4-11e9-467a-820a-1976c9857a63.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8b8facdc-e8e8-422b-80f3-e3cbb1236d8f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1edd2e21-cffd-4e05-8d87-25947d1c5512.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"20b1e101-fb90-42f4-8fb2-c08495e6afc9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3f3c3f65-16eb-417a-814a-68714b911dc7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e87e52a2-e557-45aa-b308-c3038bc60f7b.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"5f385e63-944c-4f87-a59c-12dd94238b8e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"237b1b47-c33c-4efe-8b4d-755c0aabdc29.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8aa730b3-a5db-4a2d-b33a-41e08e08ba8b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44a2ffb5-1b59-422e-93a8-2c8d9c5f748c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4cc5241e-bca5-486a-b7be-a3cc65131ecf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e79c87d8-6ad9-407c-99d3-c3b090969af1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"623ac1e8-414b-4ad6-a652-56026591c762.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a008729f-e852-4303-bdc9-9fe1e868f6c2.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Army Men: Sarge's Heroes","Overview":"In Army Men: Sarge's Heroes you play as Sarge, the protagonist from many of the Army Men games.

Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.\n\nBody Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"1998-10-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bnocQS1maqg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Body_Harvest"},"245":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bomberman Hero: Mirian Oujo o Sukue!","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Bomberman Hero: Mirian-Ōjo o Sukue!"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"823c04f6-9de8-4218-893d-fa269a7cdd3b.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b46f6f48-0c36-493f-9f24-92ab26251651.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7fb083d2-5236-4d0c-9941-172018296ca0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5922e323-d7ca-4d6f-8084-e894e2d7833e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ee3ed0ea-291f-4800-85d9-ab14ad6b2494.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1545950d-de9e-452a-a373-0cbb999f9175.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bca39095-dcfe-41ac-a6d8-7ca2209c78af.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"634b6afd-1d65-4642-81d5-81a1c00f9c7d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bcf6fbc7-c55b-4071-b575-74c775dba3ea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8775d9bd-1fc7-473b-821d-38be30a41b04.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6edb0a16-93d8-45ac-95c5-949c7b0ac728.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d741d85a-7ed7-416d-b068-1d0e8ff0eb7d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"69e48ce0-78dd-4037-bbe8-b97114aebf27.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"ed2db0c5-3353-4e24-8496-80894bda43c7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9cef4d4e-3a04-422b-8f8c-16d0ddc79ee8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"79e5bfc8-7c36-4728-b097-0d75d52fdbd4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9418f933-3310-440c-a195-6c584a0e94a7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3f08f1c7-8582-40c8-98df-f07def2197e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"7b79752e-78db-4ab3-83bb-03a8eb85b485.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e2db4c21-83fa-4e70-9297-3f1f65cd0003.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ebcf5188-dab0-47e4-9b1a-791e6b6e390a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f576e81e-58aa-4db7-917b-4a470b7a62ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"874c31a8-1bb9-4068-b238-eccbdf3f8e04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bomberman Hero","Overview":"Bomberman's latest adventure takes him across the galaxy!

After tearing through space, hell, and wherever else in the previous games, the Space Marine thought that the threat of the demons was finally past. Of course, one survived, and it is currently reanimating all of the fallen monsters in a last-ditch attempt to revitalize their evil mission. The player's task is to finally rid the universe of all the crazy hellions, from the dead guy with the pistol to the rocket-spewing Cyberdemon.\n\nThe game is very different from the original DOOM; it has larger sprites, pseudo 3D, new textures, scrolling skies, custom scripting which allows for morphing environments, spawning items and new character animations. The levels are completely new and the game features the Unmaker weapon and an alternative end boss.","Publisher":"Midway Games","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-31T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEQvVSmYlHQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doom_64"},"252":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Fighters Destiny 2"},{"Name":"Kakutou Denshou: F-Cup Maniax","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Genki","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"0dd2dc9f-b9ad-4533-a72b-28d16ce030a5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"79f30adc-ae98-4415-ab5e-5cbf7ac3c2ab.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1c1fe86e-506d-4dcb-abea-00a483a63356.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0fa2506b-da0a-4b8d-a727-8cc2896770f3.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8404a36f-c05c-42eb-a2d1-64c719e5f7d1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"89a0f991-af8b-442c-b892-3bb156da2f2e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"069132a3-3455-46a7-a4b6-e3848aa18a9d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26f9232e-eb1d-4f06-a61b-e1f4cedc6be3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ffaeb132-790d-40b3-816f-7e66656c7416.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"d31a5305-ca40-4f87-9f0b-14b085bee8ae.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c599aa2d-3373-4243-aa77-38dc8a8589a2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fa1d6da3-05d3-476e-a608-5c9208911149.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"efe1cc33-601e-41f4-adc3-63bf13cf4088.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b9575c56-b57c-44da-a5c6-084e340d89b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"205a9967-390e-412a-b931-823a748eb9cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Fighter Destiny 2","Overview":"Enter the arena and do battle with the toughest, most skilled martial arts experts on the planet.

This ultimately has Dodgers and his sidekick, Cadet, trekking to four different planets, including a large pirate ship, to obtain the upper-hand over Marvin.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"2000-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lUVDHuHN6Z8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Duck_Dodgers_Starring_Daffy_Duck"},"266":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Mario Kadingche","Region":"China"},{"Name":"Maliou Kadingche","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"871be710-7911-49b5-9d95-e5ccabe70126.jpg","Region":"China","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a5a0dd2b-3438-465b-a390-7bb816013d3f.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"aac6215c-9a8b-4d12-82e4-299652f60321.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4cc28241-f743-4efb-acfe-d2a946890b9c.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"95a8c5ab-9068-4fef-85d5-69b471c23e91.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"51fe3977-634a-4f9b-af22-00020943e874.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ca69050d-d670-4924-aca5-8a1b6b5086c6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d33caa3e-fa3a-4d2b-8e17-739ba5c7a478.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2014d119-b3c3-4589-8b1e-16c5ec2a6061.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7caa7614-0591-43c9-a2be-e7851eff0058.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd42acf2-a309-45f7-9ee0-032375865143.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5ec715d5-5505-4237-99a9-64920fa1a72a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b84f927d-82f9-4e2d-baad-c86a820031ad.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d9e6976-86e3-49bf-8a89-1d5f050b3bb2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"52d63b19-1d3d-481d-b70c-69dbaa1dd4c0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"57cd5c59-69fe-4541-ab4e-d604bf5aeb32.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"53c1b0ee-cc12-4a0a-aee9-05ea61593d2c.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f552db5b-f804-4d58-a794-d313f50943f5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8915b6c0-4579-44d3-ac10-4368c4c0f423.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"7c40c487-dc15-4b9f-a80f-083e3941f29b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"18794c6c-cfc7-4976-bb66-1b017acc41e4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5f0bd525-a4fa-44e6-981c-79c6785ae337.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c9d7b94-456d-45bb-8975-979178a4fd3c.png","Region":"China","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8d8a03f9-cbab-475a-9a8e-0062603b5336.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"37232d98-a2dc-47f8-ba23-214d12710a31.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ab752fce-0f54-4037-8db7-d59e74444b1b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"86c688a8-69e5-4bde-b4a0-9306b4b31e47.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f567760d-037c-4a69-9a92-8d527260bae4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4ec5fb75-da10-43f0-9868-d49f88f9da7d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7878fc45-3515-491b-8beb-0c2367b7ea58.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6ff9ec4f-7b5c-45c0-9ff3-f801bc3250ca.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2da2be34-b8c1-4940-92ca-01d7c184591f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"425eff4d-79a3-487e-a78b-c542c6a765c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0ad5a0f2-3cfe-48ac-a5d5-65c66340a5f1.png","Region":"China","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"322a0776-6254-40c0-9d62-713e2e8d2a7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b5b8c25a-557d-479e-a49b-335f05d587ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8695d77d-65b6-4508-945a-c472f9f02067.png","Region":"China","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Mario Kart 64","Overview":"Three… Two… One… GO!

The game features a futuristic representation of San Francisco and an arcade-style physics engine. It also features a multiplayer mode for up to four players and Rumble Pak support on the Nintendo 64 port. A major difference in game play compared to predecessors in the series is the ability to extend wings from the cars in midair and glide.\n\nAs with previous titles in the franchise, Rush 2049 features a stunt mode in which the player scores points for complex mid-air maneuvers and successful landings. There is also a multiplayer deathmatch battle mode. There are six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and one unlockable obstacle course named The Gauntlet. The single player race mode places emphasis on outlandish and death-defying shortcuts in each track. The game has a soundtrack mostly comprising techno music.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2000-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CLVYyvOw3I4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Francisco_Rush_2049"},"399":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tantalus Interactive","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"76d609fa-749a-4e24-822d-3ef26f51a9d2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"863f3c52-c7b7-47e5-8ef1-0b0823d10d0f.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"93a3a33d-9812-4462-9891-9d211724179f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"973b52d5-098a-466b-8d65-9ff9d3fb642c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6776f1e0-9cdc-4f11-a147-43319f005fde.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"08f9375a-a26a-413d-a572-740061be8614.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"779b939e-c66d-4c3f-9989-5b7738d1020e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aab5c551-b76d-4cd3-99f3-138c6edbfa93.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d7ba88da-8d5a-4c9d-aab0-2632142c3134.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5114c90b-660f-44d4-b3c7-2ef22ded4d91.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"28e9a72e-f021-4537-a5de-dc10fdb0cf14.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"705b940c-a1a9-4113-8a29-67f482d509fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"South Park Rally","Overview":"Choose your character from the cast of the popular 'mature' cartoon South Park, and tear through the streets in this racing game.

There are 8 fully-interactive landscapes, with one for each character, with noticeable links to their games. Controls are analogue-based, with different moves executed depending on the direction and how firmly the stick is pressed. Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D.\n\nThe one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1999-01-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K783SDTBKmg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Smash_Bros._(video_game)"},"405":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"H2O Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"1960f784-67c7-42f1-b464-c0fb1118d5b9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"319a7e9d-8ca7-4487-a5ee-43b996f0d670.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"da08b2e5-29a3-4f6f-95c8-2eee0bb11d34.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"031f020c-7aa1-4332-89b4-2ad86b932ff5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e933c10d-8be7-43a0-8770-d57830e9fd4a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2299ee75-021e-4f28-8741-880ca3586916.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efe4ef5b-dee6-493f-bbdb-f741ba6ff2a2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b9e88c7-2ec4-4d75-acdc-834e7fee0d64.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8023ac98-d178-4b22-93c8-4abe31a4d76e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a1a7bb33-2bc8-4c70-aa13-0c926ac580ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ddc4aa57-47a5-4e6a-90da-f9c623535a76.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"355fbab1-bf3e-4160-91c6-a891e2b486b6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f3495fa5-0205-4de0-93e2-6245fda2fbe7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tetrisphere","Overview":"What would you do if your friends were trapped at the core of a sphere layered in hundreds of Tetris pieces?

The goal is to beat the other participants in the race by successfully navigating the jet-ski through courses marked by colored buoys. Red and yellow buoys must be passed on right and left side, respectively, in order to gain speed and ensure advantage in the race. Failure to pass the buoys, on the other hand, leads to decrease in speed and eventually disqualification.\n\nGame modes include Warm Up (basically a training session in a course known as Dolphin Park); Time Trials, in which players race against time; Championship, in which players compete in a tournament, choosing one of the four available difficulty levels; and Stunt Mode, where performing various stunts awards players with point. A two-player split-screen versus mode is available as well. Players can customize their racers, modifying their parameters, which include grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision stability.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1996-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xQ1OMrv3cWE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wave_Race_64"},"412":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kodiak Interactive Software Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c5abcb23-46a4-49b2-ba0c-7d08340998ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"641b35d0-a96b-440e-99db-c5ff3d868bd4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f5b168d3-9c37-4e20-8e25-73c5cd0225a9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a8073394-3532-47f7-be24-23dea2cf0d30.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb1e4b03-31e9-4417-aa52-4e51885172c3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"71c65be2-52e9-40d0-9fcc-c235bd4d9496.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"55a3ad26-2bf8-4c8e-bc82-abf0bd34addd.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"53018e5f-a9d5-4387-b51b-7ab2025b4a39.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"WCW Backstage Assault","Overview":"WCW Backstage Assault is a professional wrestling video game by Electronic Arts.

It also has 2D and 3D \"rules\" for how the game is played. 2D is 16-bit arcade style and 3D is more realistic.","Publisher":"Natsume","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dlmPExG9EO8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flying_Dragon"},"960":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"4db8319c-305c-4e71-89e2-14b76022054e.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4155d034-d884-4572-9a9f-1861b5f060c6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"174dbec7-3280-435d-a4b0-d2a2f2e2ec07.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eabd425c-6a68-4ac8-a9e1-a586d00e644f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"62ef1d0d-f2e0-49a7-a4ce-d5881cad44b3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4713690a-6de2-41d0-a20c-2fa19fbb252c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8fdf5db1-7603-44a4-90ca-d6bfde7f9f50.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"28ca267b-9f9a-48c0-b312-56ee5fe51ab5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6867e63d-635c-4553-9c18-2e8c30617c9b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"231814ea-3b87-4560-98f5-e8b1ece23da5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"933dd5d8-e054-467f-8a9e-49db944e420f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"dd579853-a0a0-40d7-8f09-6492de1a4342.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"d5a01fb5-c48e-4019-b6c2-7d5f64c44176.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a1510233-d749-4ad9-93e0-454ff0b5e903.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8c0d4198-2304-449e-9c7b-88faf8d179c6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1e1f9be4-3d99-49d3-8545-9a8d787a08cf.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ab0a7021-2c53-4f78-9138-5b209a796d50.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e1455695-c3b6-408b-9eda-2d5587f5e2fd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11c6593e-c026-4c5e-bb93-8db4a6635479.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e8cccd53-6fae-447c-b761-e6e373d0276c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f64e874e-b372-45c6-821a-d3421396ff24.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"23eef1ca-4183-47ff-a951-6232e7784558.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"593a8fff-e02b-49e5-866e-8bd0f3182e24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"05dd95ae-6705-448b-a369-24c9ed28a19e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4850dd58-3943-4ec3-98a3-11254e2e02c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Mario Party 3","Overview":"Mario and friends are throwing a party and you're invited.

Players can choose from eight characters with different agendas, and select vehicles ranging from classic 1970's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with various kinds of weapons. Unlockables include two hidden levels (three in the Nintendo 64 version) and five hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer is also included: the Nintendo 64 version allows four players to go head-to-head.\n\nThe game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. An organization known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage everywhere except in the United States. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn.

Secret tracks can be accessed by winning and new cars can be used by finding the 'new car' bonuses hidden in each stage.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1999-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qgVn_MqWpzc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hot_Wheels_Turbo_Racing"},"1117":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KCEO","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"269b57cc-796b-43b7-a103-cc14d0e3f0f9.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3010b618-5485-454d-8d85-a481fa5a07cb.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"631863cd-1266-4f12-882d-deb7f6a8ea2b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"51931bde-7829-44be-87c0-8d9d00c8198b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d1b1ce97-b76d-4403-b9d8-4bbf0e91bb8f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cb82b32f-b5d7-4b2d-961a-b48bfa48a23e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4c686d66-3eaa-4019-aca2-5d31c5299d0b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"22842226-7a62-489c-816d-7194f0293551.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aeb2855b-c1c1-40ee-b8b9-87233019efbc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4e3eed1-8fb8-4890-a313-82ca59707f77.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"68e71204-302c-4450-acd9-3419cbd76e0b.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"48e3e6e0-12b2-449a-846c-b28fafd1f6d0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3df704ce-5f24-41ca-a380-a6416ee11d0b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4aae4191-f981-4dd6-9229-0dce86cdc7a5.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"019ad70a-cf2c-4283-b8f4-f61792c2d975.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b7762813-bf72-49ba-8e1d-49a3ea925c31.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f8f2602a-09a9-4ba0-95c8-65d081213a56.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hybrid Heaven","Overview":"Hybrid Heaven takes many elements from standard 3-D action-adventure games, such as Tomb Raider. The player can move in any direction, jump, crawl, climb, and shoot. The player must solve puzzles by disabling electronic weapons or through skillful manoeuvering.\nHowever, when battling a monster (called a \"biological weapon\" in Hybrid Heaven), the game switches to a completely different mode. The player is constrained to a small room and can no longer jump, crawl, or climb. The monster and the player move around for strategic position in the room. When they are close enough, and have built up enough energy, one or the other will decide to attack. At that point time freezes and a single round similar to a role-playing video game turn ensues: the attacker picks an attack from a list, the defender picks a defense, and the results are displayed. After the attack, both monster and player return to jockeying for position in realtime. All of this can happen within seconds, which keeps the action flowing more naturally than in most RPGs.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1999-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4sit8vmHuLY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hybrid_Heaven"},"1118":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Iggy-kun no Bura Bura Poyon","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Iguana Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"1663ecea-1fae-4ab9-87a1-5fc05c3ff233.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9acb37c6-6356-4517-b542-be3abf32c97d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9b38876f-c656-4ce7-be70-6039e97aa674.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bcc9afb3-ec44-4200-b085-43a683e4b1c0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1d3a3bd9-71a8-496a-a651-d960549b85c5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c1a3bd2a-4225-40a1-8927-da75c6fea207.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"12ae99aa-9e2d-4140-8ed5-9e9c57a693dd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f04115e-3a89-496d-922a-0e417cfd874b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88012b74-7d40-45dd-9877-61cdb182e60b.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"c5b0b5c6-de30-4125-8d51-0ef322a2236e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2de864be-2aa9-4b67-bf7b-349674c701b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f0437eb7-014f-454c-8ed3-88e6140c5678.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fa67a012-c318-49f5-84b2-ecfb8bcf5e08.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4e911349-f29a-4216-ba08-370d21fb8a25.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7caca0a5-b63e-4802-9439-218ce21c34bd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9bf470d2-7e7e-41af-abd3-b4a399b8ea58.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"57a754e6-e281-4a78-b9ad-8cf0da3daf5b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1d9b3603-bdc0-4d2d-8224-df9c7e85c339.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Iggy's Reckin' Balls","Overview":"A vertical race up towering tracks.

Customization: A feature in the game allows the player to build cars and drivers of their own design.  Both the driver's Lego minifigure and the car are built from scratch using a wide selection of LEGO bricks and parts.  This selection is limited when the player starts the game but expands each time the player completes a circuit.  The player may also use the Quick Build feature to play with a pre-made car.  Customization is purely aesthetic and has no effect on the performance of the car.","Publisher":"Lego Media","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hYyf5S8rTE4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lego_Racers_(video_game)"},"1131":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Bang","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"c1233ceb-62f8-4719-bd75-9be8f14215c2.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7345daa0-2fd2-48ce-9984-d3135c5a81b2.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5b0f6a18-c18c-45d7-b443-bf9af3db6932.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"898e814d-634f-427c-a2d3-00da3ff8044f.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a1def463-4272-4a05-b136-d42de1626eb6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"30c210e2-eed9-421c-aea6-87ebd7757702.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"91017ab6-067e-4f7f-ac9e-50070e187b83.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8b6d3e19-acd6-4f34-af41-53a82f82cbb0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2442ddd2-c73c-4a2c-b023-e70bb302f470.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8cde6c16-81fe-4ccd-ba7f-ff770648e350.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3606f1ca-afac-46a0-95e7-533021100996.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7682150a-294e-456f-8826-d40fc55ed45e.PNG","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"1b9bd6ef-58c0-4b8a-8598-a654a13ed234.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a1a67829-7177-49bd-8f5c-cd6ebe5e02bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bf9ad8ac-9c7b-4fa9-add4-b8201208433d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"30be256c-021a-4abe-8c45-f29d1b1bfad3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f0f2fc65-2461-4e4d-9f10-337d13e09252.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"be18df9e-d22b-4903-b467-e228e5af3281.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7462a2d9-d141-4d26-ad97-460e62b8fe79.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lode Runner 3-D","Overview":"The game mechanics are similar to the original; you outrun 'monsters' by using alternate routes, sliding on ropes, climbing ladders or drilling holes in the ground to trap them.  This game differs from the other incarnations of games from the series because of its apparent three-dimensional perspective.  While essentially running in 2-dimensional space, the player has an option to move in another direction every so often.  The levels are mostly spirals that require climbing to complete.  There are five worlds and each one must be unlocked by finding five cards from the previous world excluding the first.  Each world is divided into five stages with each stage divided into four levels.  The general goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gold to activate a portal that allows the player to continue.  As the player progresses, each world adds new interactive objects and tools as well as new obstacles.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2-jdEBa61yE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lode_Runner_3-D"},"1132":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"6544fa0d-f1bc-4a8e-9f15-70d8106489bb.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a3bdda25-6d31-4a90-8e1b-07059ddc930b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d401850b-c61e-4a5a-80a4-ef822873daf0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cd1c9e4b-54ef-4fe2-9cf0-1d16885d91b3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"db873d4d-9abd-4524-8725-af558e8b82b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6b7e027-5da7-4b1a-9b72-3bcd5077684c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6fd0d3a-1efe-4d69-88d2-51e2de93b3d3.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"e70aa4df-35c2-4b80-8253-2ba7ac3bdc82.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bf047e79-ff9a-48d2-bead-f99289bb0dd8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dc4f12d5-6e2c-4c4b-938a-54d94e2eb8b4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"846484ef-7497-488d-af1b-d10b6a7d2b4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"37ba20ae-95af-44cd-9cc1-ad921b0924e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab1e934f-f4de-4409-a0d9-ce7744903ad6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Mace: The Dark Age","Overview":"Mace: The Dark age is a 3D fighting game set in a dark fantasy setting.

Released to arcades in 1997, Mortal Kombat 4 is the first title from the series, and one of the first made by Midway overall, to use 3D computer graphics. It is also the last game of the series to have an arcade release. Eurocom (who had previously developed the Sega Saturn version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) later ported it to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color during 1998. An updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released exclusively for the Dreamcast the following year.\n\nThe gameplay system in Mortal Kombat 4 is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted Elder God Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm many years prior to the beginning of the series. The other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness from conquering all the realms.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"1998-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x_cTWumqmnM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_4"},"1148":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalanche Software","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"fe92c1ee-0db8-4f61-a3f1-0c53a156a7f6.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2b35bbc0-7e80-4356-b17a-64ae00dc6be2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fa746bc2-e647-4a38-a246-9132b974245e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3c3b19a5-2683-4938-82b7-e360bdc81166.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"48b971ec-65c6-4a85-8ea8-4849a10c2e13.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2a58c06-de50-4f2c-81c5-bd76035a4e91.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4acf4ab0-86c3-4a2c-b5ce-377df0be201b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"84b15bf0-9a23-42c7-b389-e7a6cb38b0d3.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"4f44b4c7-ab42-4d5f-ac73-991d3ee6df05.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"54438db3-f978-4cff-928c-50e1d130b77c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e1574e81-3bed-4bc5-9818-7ebfa635b286.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2e26c86b-563b-4d97-8c81-217eb149469e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5c785ca5-8a79-4098-8495-2e8b03d84589.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"ed6bf232-470d-4022-9eaa-fed69ed57416.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d1ac3980-1616-4ac9-a437-2eb2f55d72b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero","Overview":"Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is a story-driven fighting game that casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that occurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.\n\nGameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting environment and turns it into a hybrid fighter\/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies.

The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course.

Capcom. You select from a variety of hand-drawn cartoon characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks. As you'd expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a 'crayon meter' that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating special move.\n\nAn interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using \"Training Mode\". In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in 'Battle Mode'. This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you've trained enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1998-07-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2DbU5zNjG3w","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rakugakids"},"1187":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Rally '99","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Genki","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"c742b1a9-d2de-43b7-b583-ac9b86b733ac.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"19caadb7-7f2a-47ac-8f50-cc7c3e595853.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bb3490f2-30bc-4438-9341-6d3b2fe58fa6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"15c5fa6c-4152-4183-a8af-4b2e073dd3bf.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e458d514-cc56-484c-beed-cafcced574e7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8e0b5107-c9a2-4ab5-912e-f7336ad61270.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3d673408-a218-4a02-a47d-8659b8e18b63.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61bddfd8-66dd-452c-bd60-2188e4fc2776.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e2d2cf61-7f72-475a-b6d1-569bafa40cc7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a5597051-444d-43b0-af8a-b3e9516e1c8d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"604bf8ca-e2eb-4afb-851e-9651e2b272c3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"96e00abe-122b-4c9c-aebb-bd939db7a921.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"9555a94a-dfb3-42f9-9fd6-c2a9b05bc92f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3ddd2c85-98f5-4bbb-9274-8edcbca5784c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d7ea8440-2806-4f3d-aa35-73de4456143f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"55908b4a-f178-4727-828e-48a3194a364a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Rally Challenge 2000","Overview":"RALLY CHALLENGE 2000 takes you on a scorching tour around the world.

The high-tech theme-park would be opening tomorrow. How much Rocket, the maintenance robot, wanted to go and see it he could not even tell, but the professor barely noticed. Then it happened. Jojo the raccoon, sick of playing second banana to the insipid Whoopy the walrus, stole all of the tokens, tickets, and Whoopy. There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone.\n\nRocket: Robot on Wheels is a 3D platformer like no other. It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, real-time physics. As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again. The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose. In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game. The real-time physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.","Publisher":"Ubi Soft","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PdvP__uBBwE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rocket:_Robot_on_Wheels"},"1195":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo Software Technology","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"5cd943bf-2963-4211-b277-a728b2b8bdfc.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2a379b6e-473a-46c8-a7c0-eca45ba5eb4b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9fa64e47-910c-4bf5-9c71-ca8727a0d138.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"41b01fd7-a834-4b12-9d50-3dc32e08d1aa.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9d366f61-e476-449c-b0b5-0f8f4de34c54.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5dde7d34-f627-4e2e-935b-2f6ad5f6bd5e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e1904371-3862-460e-b7af-3f3205c2fb3e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0bf1098c-783b-4efc-a360-9be1c53e4d1b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c2e49c6e-5efa-46a1-94de-60ef69c5ba3f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e4fadabe-d96f-49fd-9308-e7230761ca6c.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"98e9d826-7ec5-43b4-b949-bd1a87b8439b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1a83100a-80fd-4826-8f65-ad79fc345b59.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"89cdd435-71e1-4978-827c-35ea9ea96dc1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f4d2b5fb-0497-4ecf-81c8-9f2e5515f289.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"90623869-2fbc-42f2-a070-d2ca33c9ce36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4fc7602c-f291-479f-93bc-5753e4598fe3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"RR64: Ridge Racer 64","Overview":"Ridge Racer makes its first appearance on a Nintendo console, including all of the fast, pick up and play action previously seen in the series on Playstation and in arcades.\n\nRR64 includes three tracks, each with three variations, making a total of nine tracks to get through. 25 cars are on offer, each with different power and speed abilities.\n\nSingle player and multiplayer modes are included.

Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In \"The Pirate Treasure Hunt,\" the babies travel underwater in search of items; \"Angelica's Temple of Gloom\" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and \"Reptar Rally\" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"1999-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ck19Wd5JyMg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rugrats:_Scavenger_Hunt"},"1197":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Midway","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"45819f42-d81d-4f25-ab09-ad97f66c6d62.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a303afe7-c17c-46bb-8ba0-7d05bc49a634.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eb4c8526-bde9-4e8a-af63-7cac799a6a47.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a995209-4d01-4dbf-9db7-2f9a880ef7ad.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d8b3d944-4267-416f-a0af-42694d1abeab.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"04b1f466-f41f-434e-a44a-22ad8801eb7c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b1c7d53-a2cb-4bd8-8413-e9e71f977c0a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8db3209-b9ca-4034-862b-28e69eb929f8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4acdc9e2-7dee-457c-bf11-60e199e7a3b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e803451f-dfb4-4d1f-ac0c-05c649a90270.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"1f9b4a09-ab0d-41b0-a0df-8193a51fb7ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e117d4de-e0e5-4109-98ce-018eab0c4799.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8c98615c-20b7-4005-a629-2bd1acc69674.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA","Overview":"Performance...

The player takes control of Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Stan to fight through the town in a first-person perspective.\n\nSingle player takes the form of a \"Story\" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels. The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight. Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls. Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this. The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps.

To add to the realism, all in-game characters, terrorists, hostages and Rainbow operatives, can be wounded or dispatched in just fractions of a second. Tools such as thicker body armor, automatic rifles, and grenades have little value before the player grows accustomed to the gameplay.\n\nBefore each mission is a planning stage, during which the player is given a briefing, and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment and uniform\/camouflage. In earlier games, the player pre-established orders and waypoints during this step. The planning stage determined elements such as the path the AI-controlled squads would follow during the mission, as well as where they will deploy devices such as flashbangs or door breaching charges.","Publisher":"Red Storm Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g3gAzkdRo_8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tom_Clancy's_Rainbow_Six_(video_game)"},"1217":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"e3949dd2-7a20-403c-8d80-d5db57cbf23d.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8caaaa6f-2511-4ea1-8c0f-17fbc1821dd8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"60e4fe66-c638-4b85-be0e-61cb53729b2a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"be182a64-aeed-4b8f-bc6c-283e647f8ef8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9e5127eb-a596-4370-9902-6ee7e17eda95.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7af60fec-db9c-4f23-a330-fa1f164c9570.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4364052d-e6ec-4023-a21f-c1044e06688e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56c2a8a2-ec6d-41a0-b8a0-2bd714798d5f.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"63d2f267-f735-4cee-890d-bf9064f0842a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4e11c3b4-92bc-4ebc-a250-68e4476e13fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c420d7a-8d3b-4fb1-ad32-79d38bd3c275.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"07252e61-ea56-43c2-9556-09defe822e49.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a2a4c896-8d34-47e2-985f-a20217421b1a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tonic Trouble","Overview":"Trouble up to your bow tie!

New sponsorship deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.\n\nYou can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.","Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t4tAd4Pe0b4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Top_Gear_Rally_2"},"1223":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Toy Story 2: Buzz l'Eclair a la Rescousse!","Region":"France"},{"Name":"Toy Story 2 de Disney•Pixar: ¡Buzz Lightyear al Rescate!","Region":"Spain"},{"Name":"Disney•Pixar Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue!"},{"Name":"Toy Story 2: Captain Buzz Lightyear auf Rettungsmission!","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f868a108-9980-4027-8da1-5cf478ac911a.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8a356323-4432-4b9a-bbb0-1cf1cf22051f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"39ec96ce-6af7-4735-ac4a-b0f01cb99493.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5b9d247b-ea44-4e06-a9df-ede281d80b22.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4dc0e41c-7dc9-465b-929f-a24c7d715e80.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5cf45000-7ab5-4a14-9f10-939f4ad4daaa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b68b77d8-82d7-4c99-aed5-75f54b6e2005.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ad788906-63e6-48f3-b4e9-245ce9378288.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e74f71eb-0e7c-4a66-87a1-784f1b038fd5.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"022ea43b-cd5a-436a-8220-f5a4b0c81cf4.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"c3703e9f-2c1e-4afd-a1d4-5ac51e9e0c69.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7e5aed71-6782-4d27-bec6-facb25a9f32b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"512209ce-2d4f-4947-a345-aecad5be7fef.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3569f423-06b8-47ae-a9a0-674dece20f1a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"48d395a3-a4bd-42aa-9c88-3f1ce1a88630.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6a86334e-e1ba-4cbb-b1fe-ee079875a1b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue!","Overview":"The Countdown to Adventure is On!

This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. \n\nThe third title in the Turok series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.\n\nTurok 2's multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2000-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YREBIIE7eUk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turok_3:_Shadow_of_Oblivion"},"1227":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"King Hill 64: Extreme Snowboarding","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Twisted Edge: Snowboarding","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Boss Game Studios","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ef98529c-fd49-4f3a-a03e-d9fb7006fa04.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b57940aa-3219-48a6-a38d-08f4f2488bc4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f92c9d28-6441-4f9c-a3a1-201d81e20337.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6a13b643-e6ec-4eff-9743-d83a55275e54.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"01ecfe7b-cdcd-4509-a4e2-28854df0e25d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b2776145-e6d7-4a58-b4f0-530d99e7a7b0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8cf85e16-21b6-4b96-89b4-1870b56cf5ec.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e68d0e7f-3ebf-4229-bed6-c554047e102a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01f2b9f4-e781-4be9-8bd7-d1e66fdcfdd2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5634c3ab-de73-42a6-bf3f-3a3661117a47.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c9321de8-c89d-49d7-a436-5d05ad28748e.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"e44e075a-a2e8-4631-99dc-912b501d432e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a9951770-3aab-4cd2-a42f-d4bd98636961.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f29fe4af-9c93-4d24-9f09-9400e54ee77a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9f2ca405-07ec-4d3d-b0fb-115fe1996174.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a203ff72-ef82-4364-ab0a-9c34c187f7ac.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cf125a71-9fd8-47e8-b892-03f97ecce271.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Twisted Edge: Extreme Snowboarding","Overview":"This is it!

But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job.

It was released only in Japan in 1998 despite the whole game being in English. It is the only Nintendo 64 game that can make use of the Nintendo 64's bio sensor which was included with the game.\n\nThe game itself offers the traditional Tetris experience: Blocks enter the screen from the top of the screen and can be moved and rotated as long as they are falling. The goal is to create full lines which then disappear, reward points and cause the game to become more difficult over time. The game is lost when the appearing stone can't be moved anymore because the screen is full. B-Type is similar but the screen gets filled with random block combinations from the ground.\n\nIn addition to this standard mode, the game features two unique variants: In \"Giga Tetris\" the player occasionally has to deal with huge blocks which break up when touching the ground. \"Bio Tetris\" makes use of the bio sensor accessory: it is clipped into the user's ear and measures the heart rate. It can be set if the game slows down or speeds up when the heart rate rises.","Publisher":"SETA","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2cE3gR6lo6w","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetris_64"},"20824":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling: Toukon Road: Brave Spirits"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Yuke's","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"84c192f6-6cfb-4d0c-b1f2-d74821e982b3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"63dd7ff0-a2c1-453b-b3b5-387123166cc2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7d12d97a-d3b5-4cbf-9de3-ae79d06b7fc2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ebafd8dd-c637-4c6d-9f6c-ed2f010b5844.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3de9a72c-0b68-42f6-a991-14405715afcf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"392e1d0f-d070-4bc6-bfd4-e05cf9a6a644.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"14fe405b-0f05-4fb3-9df6-8c063de7baec.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f3d287f5-cce4-4948-a68a-121a87c787ff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5dec6738-c0a4-4674-8872-4c00f58fcce8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"35eb3c0e-f398-47ce-8094-16cd5c84a2dc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling: Toukon Road: Brave Spirits","Overview":"Step into the ring with the bravest fighting souls of the New Japan Pro Wrestling league and fight your way to the top!

Unlike its predecessor, Frogger 2 featured a choice of different characters to play with in the game, several multiplayer modes, and an in-game storyline.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AzOhOAfQkRk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frogger_2:_Swampy%27s_Revenge"},"22602":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Wonder Project J2: Koruro no Mori no Jozet","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Givro","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"b9e25f02-5886-48a5-bdf1-63debe62e0d9.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dd47a0be-df0e-498a-b841-d624deccf077.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"404150f4-63ee-4316-bb27-9409ac40a62a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"73b782b2-8513-4d7c-9be3-c7dfcd205bb4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"98caa9d5-4781-40f7-9f2c-29d677cd4c3c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"af5241e2-1b86-46d4-a8f6-79a46317c2b8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"06411ece-8ba7-47b6-b79f-5377a728a839.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cd20d71c-5780-4a32-9c1c-c0f074bb0882.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ecfd3881-f90e-4839-8f70-551bce8cac19.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"50bf3e61-0a26-410b-a29a-a7474dea2cd2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4b61866d-a07d-43d9-a2ff-8397723b85ce.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a413a844-21d1-4f8d-afda-c24789e1396e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6d809870-db6b-4ad7-b204-083283d87f5e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wonder Project J2: Josette of the Corlo Forest","Overview":"Wonder Project J2 is a Japanese exclusive Nintendo 64 game released in 1996 as a sequel to the 1994 Super Famicon game Wonder Project J.

Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.\n\nThis version of the game have different music and lacks the voiced cutscenes due to cartridge's memory limitations, but can be played in 4-player mode like the Dreamcast version and included a Transfer Pack mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RifH3JGuvHg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puyo_Puyo~n"},"27818":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Susume!

Originally dubbed a “Pokémon clone”, it is in fact closer to games such as Digimon World or Monster Rancher for the PlayStation.\n\nThe player character is a child who starts a journey to become a monster breeder on his tenth birthday. After receiving and hatching an egg, the player walks around the world, completing requests from people and raising monsters. Requests are basic RPG quests—such as collecting an item for a non-playable character—and the monsters fight in Pokémon-style, turn-based battles. Unlike Pokémon, every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, the monster gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters level up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.","Publisher":"Bottom Up","ReleaseDate":"1999-04-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/FUMlUI_p6B0?t=26"},"31700":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ac578006-b5d1-47d6-af50-1ad20b4c12f3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b4769a52-789d-43b2-8a10-1c82e5271d88.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dcf72f32-c110-465c-a029-97e97fccd111.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8b053c81-82a8-43ce-b14e-a70603deb13f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28064120-6d17-4239-b7a9-47988a0d3579.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0f9aa5c2-1527-41c5-93d2-a4722ee246af.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0c7f0b1e-a751-43d3-98c0-a104fd38a3c5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3fe204f1-a248-4c36-ae14-50315968b36d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"216dc75d-cb63-4844-a3b0-e91e5ce65317.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"62fd4b65-8c39-49a2-b7eb-eef22e19b0c1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"J.League Eleven Beat 1997","Overview":"J.League Eleven Beat 1997 is a soccer game for the Nintendo 64.

The background story is basically about an mysterious force attacking Earth and the robot pilots battle it out to determine who fights the evil robots in the end. How the story plays out in detail depends on which of the seven characters is used in story mode. The selectable characters are the protagonists' mecha from the series Daitarn 3, Dancougar, G Gundam, Dunbine, Xabungle and Voltes V plus the R-1 from Shin Super Robot Taisen. By meeting certain conditions while playing, three more characters can be unlocked, including one that makes its debut in this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself follows the genre standards: both opponents can perform a set of standard and special attacks (the latter executed with certain button combinations). Every hit causes the energy bar to go down and whoever runs out first, loses. When a timer runs out, the one with the most energy left wins. Each fighter also has a second energy meter which can be used to perform especially powerful attacks. The robots also can fly which changes the available attack range. The playing modes are story, vs (two players), 64 (same as story mode without the story), Guts (fighting one opponent after another until the energy runs out), time attack (defeating opponents in a short time) and training.","Publisher":"Banpresto","ReleaseDate":"1998-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/zcIUnGhlfts?t=30","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Robot_Spirits"},"133447":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f102b8f6-8d5b-431c-8fc7-d4aad4a8729e.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fb0cc6ce-7beb-4e4f-b74e-01fb03dffe09.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c88402c4-b186-45dc-9143-a4d91764abf0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3509dfe1-c186-4c22-991e-d8f59876cb2c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"097b1324-3da0-4cc9-89a5-84c3e54a7509.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aa947bbe-b08c-4877-a95a-7cdb6d929378.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8dad5ba1-5006-4941-952c-b1c21edbaac4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"77ee41a0-595e-47a4-b596-17f169d5bb17.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04c19afd-ca08-4069-8027-267032a6ae20.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Super B-Daman: Battle Phoenix 64","Overview":"Super B-Daman: Battle Phoenix 64 is based on the Japanese manga series Super B-Daman, itself based on the toy line B-Daman.

His mission; to gather intelligence on a wealthy entrepeneur named Auric Goldfinger. The investigation will take 007 around the globe and back again, in twenty brand new levels that faithfully recreate the film, as well as previous entries into the series as bonus material. Tour the famous Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, drive through the Alps in a classic Aston Martin, sneak inside a shady export company compound in Mexico, and shoot your way into the gold rich vaults of Fort Knox using a vast arsenal of weaponry. Mow down the enemy like a true gangster with the Thompson machine gun, use stealth at a distance with the AR-7 sniper rifle, or ramp up the fire power with a devastating RPG launcher. And once you've foiled Goldfinger's plans to dominate the world's bullion market, sharpen your skills against friends (or foes!) in multiplayer mode. With eleven maps to compete in, a wide range of weapon loadouts, and a comprehensive character roster to choose from, you'll soon be finding yourself crammed back on the couch again in split-screen fever. A completely original musical score accompanies every stage, and due to the inclusion of the Expansion Pak, are lengthier than previously possible. This memory expanding device allows Goldfinger 64 to go farther than the original game it was built upon. A greater amount of image textures can be loaded into a level at one time, mission setups filled with even more content, and maps larger than ever before. This fan-made sequel to GoldenEye 007 aims to bring players an exciting experience, while representing perhaps the most beloved Bond film of all time with much due respect. So if you think you're up to the task of putting an end to Operation Grand Slam, grab your controller and pull up a chair. It's about time Bond was back on the job.","ReleaseDate":"2017-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/5aJZgB8j3Gw"},"138921":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Skelux","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"03d8cc92-f581-432a-b251-968e71a3fc73.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f707dc8c-288b-4b89-ba17-edead20367b1.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d5528d65-5a0c-4a70-a431-d9fa8eae1a71.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bb71187a-46ba-498d-b6ce-8b17a9b464f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0e48cc2d-af67-47f5-8ed2-221b42f7d542.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e6cd7af3-5e7e-406c-8971-66bdc830c4d4.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"86cd32e5-dc29-4251-bf56-f133fc3ca2aa.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"096a712d-483b-41b5-a47e-2c352af5a164.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6ab7b12a-886b-4beb-9da0-954117cc8344.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Super Smash Bros. 3D","Overview":"Super Smash Bros. 3D is a ROM hack of Super Mario 64 that changes all the levels into levels from Smash Bros. 64 and Melee and gives Mario and Luigi all of their moves from Smash Bros as well.","ReleaseDate":"2017-10-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/zy8k56Yfe1M"},"140575":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"SM64: Chaos Edition"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kaze Emanuar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"43e5ea86-c220-4b16-bf7e-ff0a5e4ac2d9.png","Region":"South America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6812a5a-f221-47a4-8c90-a75482329fa6.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eba3a9e2-d31f-49c8-8b19-a983b563f669.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Mario 64: Chaos Edition","Overview":"Super Mario 64 with a chaotic twist!

For example there is no mention of Trevelyan\/Luigi's parents being Lienz Cossacks and instead of calling James Bond\/Mario the \"Golden Boy\" he says the \"Golden Bro.\" Other changes include the dialog where Mario meets Natayla\/Peach as Mario doesn't straight up say he's a spy to her. \nThe Briefing is edited to not only replace the names, but also with slightly different text. Not much, but there are small differences. Moneypenny\/GoldCoin however actually has some different dialog such as mentioning that there is a girl in the cell next to you for Bunker 2. However the story itself is mainly the same as the original, with all Levels playing out basically the same as the original.

Thought about making them sunglasses, but it'd still get hit first before the back of the head did and overall was unfairly annoying. \nMishkin\/Donkey Kong is no longer the Defense Minister, that role now goes to May Day\/Pauline with Donkey Kong being the Head of Special Forces. This was done to give Pauline a role in the story, as well as explain why the \"Great Guards\" use DK's body. \nDr Doak is now Oddjob\/Toad to give him some sort of role in the story, as a result the idea of Toad \"blending in\" with the other scientists is ridiculous.","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","ReleaseYear":2017,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2InaPLqFd6g"},"155244":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kaze Emanuar","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6f5fee26-61a2-4d93-8519-9f5e2de11c9f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"aec9116e-3486-4818-bb77-9a6f0b9a398a.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"27df29ba-6558-415a-9eac-64834e49bceb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"49433841-7011-444f-8a0a-a8d05d5a552d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9afe94cb-e072-4906-ba0a-0477e9cfae6e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Waluigi's Taco Stand","Overview":"Waluigi has gambled himself into bankruptcy.

Once again, Bowser has stolen the stars and used their power to create an army of monsters and kidnap Princess Peach. The Toads built a rocket to take Mario to Bowser, but Bowser locked it before Mario could get there, so the rocket serves as the first key-door of the game.

You move the paddle from left to right to knock the ball back against a breakable wall until all the bricks are gone; and then you move on to the next level. There are 50 levels in total, and they contain a variety of blocks. Some require one hit, others multiple hits, some are indestructible and the special blocks drop upgrades for your paddle and ball. I only managed to make it to The Ridge, since I encountered a glitch that made the ball get stuck at the top of the level.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from other Arkanoid style games is that it has a scrolling screen as well as several terrain features that make the level never be a perfect rectangle. This might not seem like a big difference at first, but it adds a whole level of challenge. Half of the time you’re playing, you can’t see the ball, so you have to familiarize yourself with the layout of the level and predict where it is going to bounce ahead of time.\n\nAs with most Arkanoid and Pong games, the center of the paddle bounces the ball straight up, and the edges shoot it off in either direction. One odd thing that I noticed is that the vertical speed is always constant. The horizontal speed varies depending on where the ball enters contact with the paddle. This makes a bit strange when there’s a sudden change in angle since it appears that the ball is rapidly accelerating or decelerating and lacking any sense of momentum.\n\nThis is definitely worth having a look at it, as it’s the largest and most complete unique N64 game out there.","Publisher":"Protest Design","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"172481":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kaze Emanuar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"0eab8d7f-937b-4f85-a69e-160d97e0f0db.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d0470df7-872d-4921-814e-605cf7a0aa65.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e1423534-621f-4b75-be9f-6784c3752545.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"333c1741-b082-47b8-b819-ae23212878e8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6b74022b-1b15-4963-b335-66e119deb8fa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1bd0d9d7-4440-4735-97f1-cd936de7e672.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc2453c8-bf54-4ae0-a201-6452a3cbdf8c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"70b7a697-072d-4a1e-8bc1-43d902ad2dc0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"141ca54f-6eef-476c-8013-a3b5c55dc177.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Mario 64 Land","Overview":"Super Mario 64 Land is a ROM Hack of SM64 that is focused more linear designed levels with more diversity with its level design and themes than the original.

It is also one of the most unique hacks, making use of a large number of interesting and unique gimmicks in every one of its \"levels\". The format of the hack is also different, as most of the stars are not found in standard courses, but in small overworld areas. These areas are all large, flat areas with objects such as platforms put into them, which Mario or Luigi must traverse to reach Stars or coins.\n\nThis hack strives on changes during gameplay and progression through the hack. Oddly, the camera seems to focus on the center of the level when on Lakitu Cam, so using the Mario perspective is recommended. Beware that the various pipes and sections will change the camera. On a side note, the character selection and the final boss both require use of the directional pad, specifically the left and right inputs; because of this, you may need to ensure that you have these controls mapped.","ReleaseDate":"2009-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H_3j7d5E1N8"},"174333":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Kaizo Mario 64"},{"Name":"Mario Kaizo 64"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"OmegaEdge29","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"828ccf16-3cf2-4ef9-ab68-a793ad6383d3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e0842198-5195-414f-a2c4-3bec0c440314.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kaizo Super Mario 64","Overview":"Kaizo Mario 64 is a ROM hack made by OmegaEdge29 in 2009.

All maps, music and dungeons are custom-made. It presents the conclusion of a past war between two half of a same kingdom, the Dawnside of the east and the Duskside of the west. It is a completed romhack and lasts about two to three hours on a first playthrough.\n\nThe (successful) goal of the romhack was to produce a game that could play on Nintendo 64 Disk Drive and actually use features of this extra hardware for the Nintendo 64. LuigiBlood was responsible for porting Dawn & Dusk to Nintendo 64 Disk Drive. Many other members of the Hylian Modding community also contributed to development of the game.\n\nThe gameplay part of the game is preceded by a war between the Dawnside and Duskside. The Duskside had discovered a powerful creature and tried to tame its strength. However, the monster dragged the Duskside into attacking the Dawnside and so followed a war. After heavy damage was sustained by the Dawnside, a priestess used her power to repel the monster back to the Dawnside. The priestess' descendants were trained to protect the Dawnside if ever trouble were to arise again from the other half of the kingdom.","Publisher":"GitHub","ReleaseDate":"2019-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack"},"177125":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Racdym","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"57f2034d-b853-4790-b1ee-9f9322e14f30.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1dce9e9c-fb4a-44b3-8a41-2131f93f5972.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"08f20821-7bcb-433c-b82f-459151ac5baf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1daa0815-60be-4563-aa47-157668f17a93.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"3fc40a8a-ba5d-460c-a566-60072a67dab9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f3ab1a8d-bbd9-457e-b9ca-5eaa105280d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3f429f7c-0e62-41f0-bb04-76d10cef350e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bb909b61-6eae-4a96-a131-aed88eee4682.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"af4340aa-e327-4dfc-992b-c06bb817826a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Viewpoint 2064","Overview":"Viewpoint 2064 was a 3D vertical shmup being developed by Racdym to be published by the series owners Sammy Corporation. It was a sequel to the original Viewpoint which released in 1992.\n\nViewpoint 2064’s first known announcement was in August 1999, when Nintendo announced their Space World August 1999 lineup. The game was playable at both Space World and the September 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In Nintendo’s Space World guide book, it was given a half page advertisement and was listed as 100% complete, set for a November 11th, 1999 release date for ¥7,800.\n\nWhen IGN64 did their Space World 1999 coverage, on August 27th, 1999, they reported that Sammy was in talks with several International publishers, but that no US release date was currently planned. Despite being listed as 100% complete Viewpoint 2064 was not simply delayed to Q1 2000, but disappeared completely soon after the show with some magazines and websites stating it had been canned. However, a year later on August 14th, 2000, IGN reported that Viewpoint 2064 was scheduled to appear at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show and was set for a November 24th release date. It was listed on the organisation’s Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) website, also with a release date of November 24th, 2000, for a then undecided price.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsutaya, a chain of book and video rental stores, posted Viewpoint 2064 for sale on their website. This listing had a release date of November 17th, 2000, some preliminary box art, and a description of the game. All this information makes it likely that other retailers had been informed about the upcoming release as well, but Viewpoint 2064 did not hit this date, and by 2001 the game had been quietly cancelled.\n\nOut of all of the versions of Viewpoint that were released, Viewpoint 2064 was the only one that was developed as a true sequel, with entirely different levels, mechanics, graphics, progression, and a story. \n\nNo official reason for cancellation was given.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7ZdpC-vZe5U"},"177516":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Smash Remix Team","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"03218b87-41f5-4273-b84e-65c6af4ab988.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4283b8e2-d4c7-4bbd-bb42-e93d7e9f6b71.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e9855720-e80f-4071-b97d-569307f0b703.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"678723b4-be8b-4dda-a38b-372583e1e756.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"662cd150-b834-450e-b909-0b899e581f37.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6d78d77a-422f-4711-a484-742d22694c73.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"48a946be-90c3-42c2-803d-adc468604926.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c2511214-0821-4702-8166-57d158a66d15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"36943364-486a-4610-ad03-ceca33ee5550.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Smash Remix","Overview":"Smash Remix is a ROM hack of Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64 made by a large team of modelers, musicians, stage designers and testers.

On New Year’s Day, when the planets are aligned with the sun, the ZoS, an alien race from a parallel dimension, take over the Hedron Universe, extinguishing the sun and transporting all of the Hedrons to the alien dimension. The only Hedron to evade capture is Freak Boy, who is destined to become the hero of his people, provided he can rid his universe of the alien threat and return the captive Hedrons to their rightful dimension. As Freak Boy, players can absorb remnants of the destruction into their body and utilize them as weapons to destroy the alien invaders.

On their quest for more powerful weapons and the alien enemy, players will explore more than 25 distinct worlds throughout five levels of difficulty.

He is modeled after his various iterations in the other Smash Bros games in the series, but functions uniquely from them. Ganondorf has a litany of changes from Captain, please see the summary of changes below. As a tournament operator and semi-competitive player, my goal is for Ganondorf to be a balanced member of the cast (although my success in this endeavor is up to the player).\nThe plan is to continue to create new characters and potentially add characters instead of being forced to replace current characters on the roster.\nThis hack will be exhibited at Houston Smash 64s next tournament on Friday, May 31st 2019 at Eureka Heights Brewing Company","Publisher":"Smash Remix Team","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CvXZ6d9aUUg"},"199590":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Captain Falcon 64","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"0d112b8c-5509-4484-b771-56ee2a4acf33.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Super Captain Falcon 64","Overview":"Captain Falcon 64 is a SM64 character hack by PastaPower and I, but actually has custom code unlike most character hacks as well as the features listed below.\n\nFeatures:\n\n*Works on emulator and console!

Originally, the game had nothing to do with the Star Fox series and was intended to be a stand-alone title. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, he had noticed the striking similarities between the game's characters and those of Star Fox, and so the decision was made for the game to become part of Star Fox as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Although Rare scrapped the project due to Nintendo wanting it to be a Star Fox title on the GameCube, there is still a lot of leftovers from the game's development, which led to the game evolving into what became \"Star Fox Adventures\".\n\nA prototype of the game was published by Forest of Illusion on February 20th, 2021, who had purchased a CD from a private Swedish collector containing the late prototype.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hH_Nn4QwHgU&","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Fox_Adventures"},"200991":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"5af16738-dd92-485b-8bc9-4a624b7ea6db.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f074359-3c12-481a-955e-e0cae0a3a1be.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Super Luigi 64","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack"}}
