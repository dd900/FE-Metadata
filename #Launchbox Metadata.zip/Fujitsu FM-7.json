In the confusion, several lab animals have also fled their cages, so the ship's life sign scanners cannot be used to pinpoint the location of the alien creature. The commander orders the crew to sweep every room and corridor of the ship so the alien can be recaptured as fast as possible. What the Thrasybulus crew don't know: the creature is a highly advanced predator, able to metamorphose into new forms quickly, and ready to kill without warning. A nightmarish fight for survival begins.\n\nThe Alien is a turn-based strategy game, in plot and setting inspired heavily by the classic 1979 science fiction horror film of almost the same name. The goal is to either capture or kill the alien, or, for a worst case scenario, engage the ship's self destruct sequence and escape in the shuttles. The crew consists of seven members, each one belonging to one of three character types with different skills: Officers, scientists and engineers. Officers can access the ship's armory and engage the self destruct, scientists can handle lab equipment and access the computer system, and engineers can rig equipment to construct makeshift weapons.\n\nIn each game turn, the game switches between any rooms where crew members are present. After choosing which person should act next, one from a list of pre-defined actions can be selected. These include picking up and combining items, using weapons and equipment, catching escaped animals and using ship systems like the airlock, computer or self destruct activation. After actions are taken, the crew members can be moved around the ship. To aid in plotting movements, the game displays a map of the 30 rooms of the ship that also shows crew and equipment status as well as the life scanner readings.","Publisher":"CSK Research Institute Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"187970":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b96271a0-3550-40a6-b2b5-47dabfaba614.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alpha","Overview":"Alpha is an early game by Square, that had started its existence as a developer of Japanese-only text adventures before it became famous for its Final Fantasy series.

Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day\/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\nArchon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"187974":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HARD","Genres":"Action; Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"e5ac9f50-0064-4716-a612-fb9ef6ed7a4d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b76a5ae-0cdd-4a65-866e-ca977af053b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dd84143c-b120-4d74-bc88-d7aab3ab862b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d03d5f47-4ab0-47f2-ab14-af9bc8749a12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bishoujo Shashinkan: Moving School","Overview":"In Bishoujo shashinkan (Pretty girls photo exhibition or something like that), your task is to photograph pretty girls in various situations.

Perseus starts the game on a raft off the coast of the island, which is crawling with monsters which randomly move about. These can be fought by running into them while holding down the fight button. Due to inexperience, only the light blue soldiers may be killed at the start of the game. But each won battle improves Perseus's offensive and defensive statistics, allowing Centaurs, Cockatrices, a Dragon and the gorgon herself to be eventually overcome.\n\nWinning a battle also restores a small amount of Perseus's energy. Energy is decreased though by being hit by enemies and also slowly decreases with time. Perseus starts with 1000 energy, which can be supplemented by finding energy sources scattered around the island. Once the energy reaches zero, the game is over. The game can also be lost if Perseus's raft is capsized by one of the giant crabs that infest the surrounding seas.

Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\n\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender).

Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord"},"188042":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e9111f3e-7a79-467e-847d-cb1cc0df7c09.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"34093001-5654-41c0-83a9-0aa1293ed936.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds","Overview":"Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get the staff back along with Gnilda's blessing.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"188043":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d9355b51-f6dd-400c-9985-479802d6b3b5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29781af2-1111-41f8-8936-f50598c7eed1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn","Overview":"A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace.

The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.\n\nLegacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.\n\nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_III:_Legacy_of_Llylgamyn"},"188044":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"ed9619d4-6804-4946-804c-52db8695e353.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bab729c1-c111-4e64-88cb-98ea1bb5d770.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry: The Return of Werdna","Overview":"The fourth game in the Wizardry series, The Return of Werdna takes a decidedly different approach from all the games that preceded it. Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_IV:_The_Return_of_Werdna"},"188045":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"71e9a101-0c3d-4677-a178-2026155acfec.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05a3a28b-5a1c-48b6-9c2a-ba1ed53fb1fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a6868f67-dcbe-4de2-a768-998deb9acf3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"World Golf","Overview":"World Golf is a tournament golf game featuring 30 professional golf players.

The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \"karma\" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many \"good\" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xanadu_(video_game)"},"188048":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"de670c73-7ead-4a43-bdec-820f6b9b38c4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c33a2ad6-9afd-4a2e-ae97-9c357221669b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b6657645-5d00-4ac9-97e3-e7e954e02749.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9715b883-f87c-42e0-907d-57a3b6cd9e7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Xanadu: Scenario II","Overview":"Xanadu: Scenario 2 is an expansion pack to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II.

It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns.

The player usually controls only the protagonist and Blue; both can use beam attacks or the much more powerful, but limited missiles. As in other RPGs, characters gain items and become stronger after defeating enemies.","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"188057":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Carry Lab","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"3f2fe8ea-6699-4332-b014-2d4a011266be.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"2a487020-6b80-4a5a-92c9-3de1bdcb0e6a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a8d906cd-1998-4a49-850e-18f83ef60527.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"248a3e03-1547-43da-be85-222f3aac34b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e44a415c-37f3-4f96-8738-099f9d12c4ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"F2 Grand Prix","Publisher":"Carry Lab","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"188058":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Random House","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"13257771-3810-4f4a-aaaf-9f5f58803d90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0be75e9c-1185-4a05-a126-71385ed87fd8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c3ec1ae8-5088-40d6-a593-436ffd76cf0d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c842ad4b-d453-4b74-943e-213b42eee2b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1fe1cba2-29d9-42e6-a433-540723789cb6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8902488a-3d08-4a39-8b42-4a6ad45a7b67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"44e37738-2b1d-45f9-bcdb-33ff53c83917.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ankokujou","Overview":"Ankokujou is an Adventure game, developed by Random House and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1984.

The game consists of maze-like stages heavily populated by enemies. The prince has to fight his way through by using ranged magic, which effectively turns the game into a shooter. The magic attack can have different properties depending on the special items picked up by the prince. Throughout the game the player will also find items that restore or permanently increase the protagonist's health. Still-screen scenes (called \"visual stages\") advance the story between levels.","Publisher":"System Sacom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"193249":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Starcraft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"600e41de-0f39-409f-b1c0-1e6a0de62b0a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"bfb461f2-1f6a-4723-a18f-0b807555d43e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b334e3bc-445d-4db9-bf41-19524ac390f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mission Impossible","Overview":"This is adventure #3 in Scott Adam's text adventure series.

The game is inspired by Hi-Res Adventure #1: Mystery House and although it uses the same name and gameplay, there is no Agatha Christie-esque subplot, no competitors and the player is alone. The objective of the game is to find a treasure that is hidden somewhere in the house and then escape with it. Several items can be found around the house that can be picked up and used in order to proceed. There are also various hazards that will kill the player's character if not careful enough.\n\nThere are no room descriptions and the text commands are in very simple English. This has to be done in a two-stage input; you have to type a verb first, then press RETURN and then enter the noun. Example: Open - RETURN - Door. Directions must be abbreviated (e.g: N\/S\/E\/W\/U\/D).\n\nControls differ between some versions: The PC-6001 and the MSX versions use cursor keys for the movements instead of text commando's. The FM-7 version does not use a two-stage input, but you need to input full sentences instead. (e.g. open door).","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/yU-ONX6rUog"},"193253":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"149a7137-0883-4362-8ca2-087d6c308037.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3be84f66-a234-42f3-a8f6-d077a02a2cd6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ebc301b7-08d5-40ef-ad46-fdcf46847071.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e3cf9c06-fe88-4c5b-bba4-d1b2088a5092.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"90d38251-de7a-466e-ab1a-0ca9b013b016.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nobo","Publisher":"Compac Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"193254":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Carry Lab","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"3063bd0c-9dfe-47e6-85d5-e657579d7e86.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9819996a-f06f-4e13-afdd-2db8315e76c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"de8d5c75-4b20-4863-8977-4f6418a1cc36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Oushou","Publisher":"Carry Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"193255":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ad413499-f295-4b53-8407-5bf23f272daf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fda9735b-106f-4ef6-aa77-8326b81f6f9b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b7e4d1b3-3286-4fd9-8d6e-0e8eccf47959.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"18ed9d3a-4480-4a83-b047-ce3d77f13080.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1da83eff-0113-4551-867e-07b4aa590807.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Palms","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"193256":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a5907ca3-aaae-43b6-b977-b9e23ff73421.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0f477331-a672-4384-9b0e-a24e83315eea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"307efb17-af75-489b-9b17-9bbb94eb6516.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"125540be-676d-49c9-abc8-b62e8823b345.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Penguin-kun","Publisher":"Open-Reach","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"193257":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"aa273752-1f2c-4e8c-85f9-beaa6f07b81f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"c7d4a4cc-bbe0-40d6-8eaf-13601960d06c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5ee8164e-74ce-4856-8ce4-12f410be1678.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"31666ac8-01a3-44cc-b1f0-ad06fa7643fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"def07dd8-d78c-4db7-aa79-6679a6fa2bf4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Plazma Line","Publisher":"Tecno Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"193258":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pax Softonica","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"53b1a734-88d6-487a-83f5-ebcdf4b88de1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"bdef1d26-4cfc-4376-bad0-db5fa122858f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4355652a-b494-43f5-8899-2ea3cda6d899.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"75928fdc-439d-4dbd-bb5c-a9fc6c3e318b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2009a331-a253-49f2-8628-910c164c8f7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Princess Quest","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"193259":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hot-B","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"cc012bf9-4c80-4070-bab3-fc704405fbf6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ad80ca07-6846-4665-8658-9a34712c4a53.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07c2f8f8-0f20-4b7b-9701-01322664dfc5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ed79aa49-e706-4a84-8bcc-1058d614f03a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"In The Psychic City","Overview":"About ten thousand years ago, certain humans began to develop psychic powers, eventually evolving into a new race known as the Rapp people. For the most part, they succeeded to hide their identity, living among humans; but humans have always mistrusted their supernatural abilities and mercilessly killed them whenever they were spotted, such as for example during the medieval witch hunts. Finally, the Third World War in the 21st century saw the Rapp people as scapegoats. They were hunted down and forced to hide in the ruins of New York. The protagonist of the game initially participates in combat against Rapp people, but is later saved by them and taught psychic powers, effectively becoming a Rapp himself. From that moment on, the hero swears to free the Rapp people and restore peace.\n\nIn The Psychic City is a Japanese-made RPG; gameplay-wise, it is more similar to Western games, though it contains some original ideas of its own. The player creates the main character by distributing skill points. The skills include Shield, Telepathy, Psychokinesis, and others. Some of them have to be used outside of combat in order to advance in the game.\n\nThe game uses very simple graphics, with the main character represented as a square on a top-down map. The player navigates the map, sometimes using psychic powers to access new areas, and fighting enemies that occasionally pop up in turn-based fashion. The fights are viewed from a first-person perspective, and the enemies are mostly restricted to robotic and mechanical creatures.","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"193260":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"eb2cbf49-de3e-4a44-9fd5-135468cf1423.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"47d6bd2b-3834-4d99-84fe-98a1f7d60089.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7230e9f3-2184-43ff-95a6-5f77c6888d6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bd21750e-b2db-4848-a5ec-812e95667ddd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Push Pull II","Publisher":"Compac Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"193261":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Starcraft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a7161b0b-c9a8-4471-a76c-424c728198e5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"63812cb7-19cb-473e-bd7d-2bf25d704c99.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5c26187e-e04c-422e-8236-8f0057d363d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"75542786-c2a4-4339-b465-2b2992a2535e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b58731a7-6c23-4681-8820-b5c312987a9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Quest","Overview":"A dragon is terrorizing the kingdom of Balema, and King Galt send his champion, named Gorn, to solve the problem.

Once they are in this form you can pick them up and drop them into the bottle on the right side of the screen. Over time the bacteria will change to angry bacteria which will duplicate themselves or become evil pirate looking bacteria that will kill you if you touch them. They also can convert other bacteria into deadly bacteria if they run into them. As the game progresses more and more bacteria are added into the levels. It’s a pretty simple game though and not too difficult until the later levels. Side note: the directions on the title screen use a word that is now very taboo in Japanese to describe the “crazy bacteria”, which is “kichigai”. Not sure if it was as offensive at the time of release but odd to see a cutesy game like this have something like that.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/49Jre2Po9QE"},"195316":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kikuta Masaaki","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c8c6d339-bb38-42ec-a7d2-6adfbd7f01b7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7cb1d458-441a-4d9d-b6fa-01519b75600e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3b5f1f47-1468-4974-a003-3436fdec7e00.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ebbce59f-31ce-4471-b9ec-1ff0d9c255d7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3ae22202-89b0-4d4a-8619-934bb116885c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0fcf8fee-8f28-4db9-9d84-e512dad33d67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hitsuji Yaai!","Overview":"In Hey Sheep! you control a shepherd boy who must gather his sheep into the fencing before nightfall so he can go on a date with a girl.

One of such sex dolls has been stolen, and the Oranda Corporation hires a private investigator to retrieve it.\n\nThe second entry in Koei's self-proclaimed \"Strawberry Porno\" series (following Danchi-zuma no Yūwaku) has certain similarities to its predecessor in interface and overall concept. However, it is a much more open-ended game with emphasis on gradual exploration and interaction, which gives it a definite role-playing flavor in addition to basic adventure-like gameplay.\n\nLike in the preceding game, the player character is generated by stopping rapidly revolving counters assigned to individual parameters. These parameters influence the chance of success in subsequent encounters with women, though much of it is calculated randomly. The player area is a fairly vast top-down urban environment consisting of numerous interconnected screens, which are mapped as the player explores them.","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"195319":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f639a3af-85c9-4319-820f-8d550388a1e9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac2f5196-f952-4624-b1cd-5369ec754721.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2beef871-b3a5-45ca-b581-80f7ca94c0b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"94682211-7540-4150-9893-6b8273afb8ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pop Lemon","Publisher":"Champion Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"195320":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Symgo Owno","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"4244117f-5a4c-409c-8646-7d068f1a2028.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b0a88725-328a-423d-8853-f9ffa3100fcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b4a3d153-ed6d-4867-beaf-6aa74d8748a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Stone of Deity II: Stolen Stone","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"195321":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Great","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"24a21966-9105-48af-a715-e4238e360a44.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ae85c4e-43d2-433f-aa9d-6642b82d76e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Utsukushiki Emono-Tachi","Publisher":"Great","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"195322":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hot-B","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"7e0c0bb1-180e-4c2d-98b4-f4e424099c66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ad8c8392-ac7c-46f1-8ced-1e19de42c9a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"50f63ad7-895d-4699-8f41-8d6e3057d60e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yami no Iyo Densetsu","Overview":"You're a spiritual detective Shura and being requested to help Metropolitan Police Department to investigate murder of a man who was sucked all the blood off and death of a girl in a different prefecture.","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"195323":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Akira Miyata","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"d86607f8-95a8-46f6-b1a8-c971dc7a330d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a59ee42c-3531-434e-af02-43bfa000559d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"721374b7-aef7-46b8-b4d7-ed392578d993.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yellow Lemon","Overview":"Yellow Lemon is a simple text-based simulation game consisting entirely of conversations with four school girls.

You’ll know a “Mine Carrier” is moving across the screen as you’ll hear an alarm sound. When you move your missile platform you’ll notice your missiles move too even after being shot so take note of that. Also even if the enemy missiles miss you they will star fires on the ground that you cannot pass until they burn out which can easily get you trapped. This game is rather hard and it is very annoying to hit the “Killer Stations” especially after a few levels.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/60YFKpRK4Fo"},"195334":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Yume no Puro Yakyū"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Jun K.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"39ab92d7-64d8-4b3f-a628-176ee9a6a525.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"18147a1d-8d8b-48d8-a4fe-57f73c504ef7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"197f9d90-15a4-4525-bf31-d81020db3f87.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aece2fc1-a287-4b2c-8231-b606da066795.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"80e27014-76e9-44d4-ac90-e5615a5328cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c25a1c78-ccff-4eac-aebe-bda681faf61b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"14a5f084-f3f9-4930-a930-88cf3ba7e3b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yume no Puro Yakyuu","Overview":"This game is basically a simulation of managing a baseball team. The only two teams involved however are the Saitama Seibu Lions and the Yomiuri Giants with what looks to be their rosters from 1982. You’re the coach of the team and make decisions regarding the batting and fielding lineups. Once the game begins you’ll watch as your line up goes against the other team and it will simulate the entire game to see who wins. During this you’re able to stop the play and swap pitchers or pinch hitters it seems. The game is entirely Japanese so I’m not 100 percent of what’s going on but that seems to be the basic gist of it.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/DcNxyU3GK4o"},"195335":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"M&M","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"4e1dd160-4eba-491e-9e44-e644a0fbdbbc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5f528d7f-f149-4c60-8394-978ceb6684e8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"599aa4c4-08a2-4886-8072-afd1383ea212.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"af8b9b26-b657-4c3d-b1cd-14aec182b704.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bd1fb71f-19d4-49aa-8dd7-8142c27c5f39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b0fff688-fed2-4068-a68f-d8e8fb60a505.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1604b2e8-dfd8-4494-a181-4bb2a8111964.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"I wa Sanjutsu Nari","Overview":"This game *might* be the first simulation game of running a hospital created beating out Theme Hospital by quite a while! The game title is a pun of sorts on the phrase “I wa Jinjustu Nari” which translates into something like “A Doctor is a Savior”. The game begins by telling you that after you made a lot of money you decided to become a medical doctor. You have 10,000,000 in yen you can take on in loans for ten years so your goal is to build a private hospital and make as much money as you can.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/C9x5nSsJMwg"},"195337":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Takuya Kojima","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"edd47bb7-0d86-4f95-8d65-3903136d3af4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d3b4e575-27d1-499c-b426-3732a274aa85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6ece1e36-027f-476f-872d-86fd50b360c2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1376dd19-faae-4c79-9376-35e8fee4ae8f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ef3d4335-f6e2-4d6f-99ae-5172d4447299.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1ea4657e-0316-4f3d-9e15-0c3184f36bd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"05750d26-b14d-46d9-a155-305fd5bda59f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Attack on Pearl Harbor","Overview":"Attack on Pearl Harbor, part of the Epoch’s World War Game series, is an early war simulation game. You play as the Japanese in the historic attack on Pearl Harbor that happened in World War 2.  The game is entirely in Japanese so it is difficult to understand if you’re an English-only speaker for sure. During gameplay you can basically dispatch attacks and choose the ships you’ll attack. You can also view the HP and defense of the various units. Upon attacking you’ll find out how many men you lost and how much damage you did to whatever unit you attacked. Lastly you can view a map and where the ships are positioned at the time. Hard to say much else as I lack the ability to play this game deeply without a knowledge of Japanese but that’s the basics of it.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/v0UQRgO0V-U"},"195338":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"623b2f1f-d350-493a-b4d3-3205dffddbaf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"ea43fa46-18fd-40f9-b6e7-5703ec748133.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1201ed5d-4d08-44b8-a59b-6d8d5090546e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6bd3216-5d14-4765-987a-2ff175c395d2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5a6bcbf7-355c-48e7-a6f7-0902374b6b08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5d5b055a-b22c-489f-9e7d-aa20aa226b53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Elevator Game","Overview":"Elevator Game is a pretty simple game in which your goal is to save the girl at the top of the building before she jumps to her death.
