Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\nArchon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Free Fall Associates","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187973,"FileName":"1070f6ef-f660-4b4b-ab5b-6c2223f4602b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187973,"FileName":"a2b54419-c8aa-4b4d-ba02-d00fd58ae399.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187973,"FileName":"15529579-c454-4907-bde3-48282aa28279.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187973,"FileName":"4f69fac8-75ee-4966-899b-21020c49fecb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187973,"FileName":"731ac6ce-7882-433d-89b4-9757c52cb5bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187973,"AlternateName":"Archon","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187972,"Name":"Argo","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Loosely based on the Greek myth of the Argonauts, Argo focuses on its central protagonist Iason (Jason), narrating a simple story that does not quite correspond to the known myth: Iason's father has been poisoned, and his native city Iolkos overrun by monsters known as Pontos.

Finally, Arion and Geedo (a huge ape-like creature who had become Arion's friend and companion) left the Underworld to find Zeus. Seneca, a small thief, makes off with Arion's sword and this leads Arion to his first encounter with the forces of Zeus, commanded by his daughter Athena. Arion is captured but is later set free by Lesfeena, Athena's mute serving girl. As Arion rejoins Geedo and Seneca (and worries about Lesfeena), the forces of Zeus and Poseidon face each other in battle.

With a point-and-shoot, you need only get one variable right, whereas the pro camera requires you to set both aperture, shutter and film speed correctly.\n\nYou are only given a few chances per shoot to get the right exposure, or you will just see a miscoloured picture flash briefly. Judging the exposure correctly grants you a picture of the girl, often in a surprising state of undressing, whereafter you progress to even more erotic poses.

But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.).

Energy is decreased though by being hit by enemies and also slowly decreases with time. Perseus starts with 1000 energy, which can be supplemented by finding energy sources scattered around the island. Once the energy reaches zero, the game is over.

Many of these maps based on real-world locations (e.g. Europe, China and Korea, etc.), though without any specific dates or pre-history given, and always with contemporary weapons and vehicles. A map editor is also included.\n\nLike in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Production costs money, and fuel has to be delivered to the units regularly with supply trucks.

Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.\n\nThe player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive.

As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature.\n\nGirls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game. The story progression relies more on direct dialogue and usage of items than on \"triggering\" events by repeatedly selecting commands. It is possible to look and otherwise interact with objects by moving the arrow keys and highlighting the object on screen. The interaction is still quite limited, though; not every screen has interactive objects, and most of the time the hero is allowed to move between locations only when dictated by the story.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Great Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Great Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187999,"FileName":"d563f9f2-5753-4bc8-b6ac-c50eae9fb9b5.jpg","Type":"Box -

For the most part, they succeeded to hide their identity, living among humans; but humans have always mistrusted their supernatural abilities and mercilessly killed them whenever they were spotted, such as for example during the medieval witch hunts. Finally, the Third World War in the 21st century saw the Rapp people as scapegoats. They were hunted down and forced to hide in the ruins of New York. The protagonist of the game initially participates in combat against Rapp people, but is later saved by them and taught psychic powers, effectively becoming a Rapp himself. From that moment on, the hero swears to free the Rapp people and restore peace.\n\nIn The Psychic City is a Japanese-made RPG; gameplay-wise, it is more similar to Western games, though it contains some original ideas of its own. The player creates the main character by distributing skill points. The skills include Shield, Telepathy, Psychokinesis, and others. Some of them have to be used outside of combat in order to advance in the game.\n\nThe game uses very simple graphics, with the main character represented as a square on a top-down map. The player navigates the map, sometimes using psychic powers to access new areas, and fighting enemies that occasionally pop up in turn-based fashion. The fights are viewed from a first-person perspective, and the enemies are mostly restricted to robotic and mechanical creatures.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Hot-B","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193259,"FileName":"cc012bf9-4c80-4070-bab3-fc704405fbf6.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193259,"FileName":"ad80ca07-6846-4665-8658-9a34712c4a53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193259,"FileName":"07c2f8f8-0f20-4b7b-9701-01322664dfc5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193259,"FileName":"ed79aa49-e706-4a84-8bcc-1058d614f03a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193234,"Name":"Ixion","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/9G5omVKDwVk","Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Try-base","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193234,"FileName":"c1b75bf4-7a64-4f86-8020-cd56447742d4.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193234,"FileName":"3dc0e545-9b2a-4305-b42a-645cc05ee936.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193234,"FileName":"b0afc870-3663-41bb-80ce-a6b5b1480eb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193234,"FileName":"4b0c505d-1fa5-4764-acb8-8cfc00cdb2e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193236,"Name":"Jelda II","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Carry Lab","Publisher":"Carry Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193236,"FileName":"4f480eb4-8889-44f1-b90b-8ff9b440424a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193236,"FileName":"716ed221-1e12-4ddd-a8f2-8f57faf02d36.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193236,"FileName":"ab84d9f4-a759-434c-ab51-08334acc0c5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193236,"FileName":"c3db126c-23bd-45eb-b512-aab1f365974c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188004,"Name":"Jesus","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"It is the year 2061, and Halley's Comet is coming towards Earth.

You’ll find you’re constantly being blocked by shooting the enemies either due to the “Barrier Satellites” – they’ll drop down on top of your ship to block your missiles – or more annoyingly the floating blue orbs which are “Space Mines”. These will go away temporarily once shot but if a “Mine Carrier” appears and crosses the screen they will all reappear! You’ll know a “Mine Carrier” is moving across the screen as you’ll hear an alarm sound. When you move your missile platform you’ll notice your missiles move too even after being shot so take note of that. Also even if the enemy missiles miss you they will star fires on the ground that you cannot pass until they burn out which can easily get you trapped. This game is rather hard and it is very annoying to hit the “Killer Stations” especially after a few levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/60YFKpRK4Fo","Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"e162e0e9-f3de-4a35-9c88-fed7f4d7189a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"1eb85294-72f1-4cdc-a69b-457ce867897b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"1fdc52ee-90bc-4111-86de-02c8373b2095.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"91ccd20c-7889-4d2e-beee-8fe4969215f1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"f84d4165-4e73-4d07-8d3f-ffe7d19ce376.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"fdb5af30-0b48-42a5-8b9e-8ed00b9f1811.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195330,"FileName":"bf3846bf-35cb-4e64-bf75-9103339364ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195307,"Name":"Kinasai!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The game is basically a clone of the Universal arcade game Space Panic.

Much like the original title, the action takes place on single screens, but the objective on each stage is no longer simply to kill all the enemies. There are four different screens, which cycle in order with increasing difficulty.\n\nThe first screen sees Mario attempting to reach the top of the screen through moving gaps; at the top of the screen are five switches, and if all five are active simultaneously, the exit gate will open. The second screen features trampolines, which Mario can use to stun enemies; kill all the enemies and an exit platform will appear. The third screen includes conveyor belts which can be used much like the trampolines to stun enemies; the goal here however is to collect money, and eventually a ring will appear at the top of the stage which must be collected.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nNobunaga no Yabou: Zenkoku-ban is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\n\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188018,"FileName":"6ddc9947-f5c5-4513-8620-98e4d1ef4e9f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188018,"FileName":"3d368ed7-c68c-4a89-9cdc-b0979bea0475.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188018,"FileName":"955475a1-aee6-4b85-9168-7d6433cf0cea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188018,"FileName":"3d19ad5a-f328-4ff0-8ff2-7e00fe31bfc2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188018,"FileName":"07be09e1-5c33-4e59-9c87-366d87127e57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195329,"Name":"Ooi!

However, it is a much more open-ended game with emphasis on gradual exploration and interaction, which gives it a definite role-playing flavor in addition to basic adventure-like gameplay.\n\nLike in the preceding game, the player character is generated by stopping rapidly revolving counters assigned to individual parameters. These parameters influence the chance of success in subsequent encounters with women, though much of it is calculated randomly. The player area is a fairly vast top-down urban environment consisting of numerous interconnected screens, which are mapped as the player explores them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Koei","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195318,"FileName":"9e78600d-e01d-4b8a-b1ea-3ea080e1eaaa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":195318,"FileName":"dcc2886a-f084-4270-bef5-16e5de8a7cf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195318,"FileName":"3658d278-ee9e-4e5b-b344-e36267791040.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193254,"Name":"Oushou","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Carry Lab","Publisher":"Carry Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193254,"FileName":"3063bd0c-9dfe-47e6-85d5-e657579d7e86.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193254,"FileName":"9819996a-f06f-4e13-afdd-2db8315e76c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193254,"FileName":"de8d5c75-4b20-4863-8977-4f6418a1cc36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193230,"Name":"Ōzumō","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Ōzumō you will be entered into a sumo wrestling tournament to fight your way up the ranks.

The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, \"Racoon\", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship \"Septemius 2\", was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.\n\nPsy-O-Blade is a Japanese adventure in anime style.

In the confusion, several lab animals have also fled their cages, so the ship's life sign scanners cannot be used to pinpoint the location of the alien creature. The commander orders the crew to sweep every room and corridor of the ship so the alien can be recaptured as fast as possible. What the Thrasybulus crew don't know: the creature is a highly advanced predator, able to metamorphose into new forms quickly, and ready to kill without warning. A nightmarish fight for survival begins.\n\nThe Alien is a turn-based strategy game, in plot and setting inspired heavily by the classic 1979 science fiction horror film of almost the same name. The goal is to either capture or kill the alien, or, for a worst case scenario, engage the ship's self destruct sequence and escape in the shuttles. The crew consists of seven members, each one belonging to one of three character types with different skills: Officers, scientists and engineers. Officers can access the ship's armory and engage the self destruct, scientists can handle lab equipment and access the computer system, and engineers can rig equipment to construct makeshift weapons.\n\nIn each game turn, the game switches between any rooms where crew members are present. After choosing which person should act next, one from a list of pre-defined actions can be selected. These include picking up and combining items, using weapons and equipment, catching escaped animals and using ship systems like the airlock, computer or self destruct activation. After actions are taken, the crew members can be moved around the ship. To aid in plotting movements, the game displays a map of the 30 rooms of the ship that also shows crew and equipment status as well as the life scanner readings.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"CSK Research Institute Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187969,"FileName":"b3f7f7ec-cef8-4a8c-965a-580d1b3a7f1d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190217,"Name":"The Billiards","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Compac Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190217,"FileName":"6639ccc4-9ef6-4ea6-afdf-b8ae029cbbd3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190217,"FileName":"61b98259-adf1-471b-a90b-dcef3f6a38b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190217,"FileName":"a51e6df8-7c0e-4520-a436-25fd966b20a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190217,"FileName":"1969dcb3-6f94-4d2a-9363-8343bc579ff3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187975,"Name":"The Black Onyx","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Rumor says that the legendary Black Onyx, an artifact that grants eternal youth and happiness to those who can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro.

The protagonist either attacks enemies with his sword or throws magic balls at them, which come in limited supply.

Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time.\n\nUnfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188052,"FileName":"f58b6709-c92f-4951-a3ad-465f9ea40724.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188052,"FileName":"cf061308-3d6b-4842-a983-38690517d75f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188052,"FileName":"f8b59934-d5d8-443b-8cce-cba4b7da355c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193279,"Name":"Ultra Dice","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Star Pack","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193279,"FileName":"afcbf413-8b0b-4429-be4e-7b38f808eaaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193279,"FileName":"230eb881-d95c-4314-b776-41e022028d79.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193279,"FileName":"01abbe4c-6db9-4e72-8b94-22ec93ba2923.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193280,"Name":"Ultra Yonin Mahjong","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Tsukumo Denki","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193280,"FileName":"32f17f4a-34e6-47ba-8770-a0261295515e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193280,"FileName":"90310bf9-a489-4d06-8a1d-54e7aa1f2e35.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193280,"FileName":"a12713d5-cf49-4aa0-85fb-82050e02c586.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193280,"FileName":"87d8fea3-89c5-4105-94a1-3e18e53ca384.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":193280,"AlternateName":"Ultra 4-nin Mahjong","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":193281,"Name":"Ulysses","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Ulysses is an adventure game where you play the part of Ulysses in ancient Greece.

It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple.

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188044,"FileName":"ed9619d4-6804-4946-804c-52db8695e353.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188044,"FileName":"bab729c1-c111-4e64-88cb-98ea1bb5d770.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193286,"Name":"Woody Poco","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Publisher":"dB-Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193286,"FileName":"d07aa56c-f83e-44a5-8869-dc8ebc7abbd7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193286,"FileName":"01af206f-5524-4d0d-b6cb-36658514d0b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193286,"FileName":"f3f04bb5-fcc7-4f1b-9c0c-1a7832ecd9ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193286,"FileName":"15f6fc56-4d37-4a3a-b037-0c5fb885285d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188045,"Name":"World Golf","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"World Golf is a tournament golf game featuring 30 professional golf players.

The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \"karma\" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist.

Otherwise, the gameplay system remains identical to that of the predecessor; with side-scrolling exploration, separate top-down battle screens, \"bumping\" action-based combat, and role-playing system with levelling up, equipment, etc.\n\nThe game requires the original Xanadu to play; character creation must be done with the original game discs inserted, after which the player can directly access this scenario.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188048,"FileName":"de670c73-7ead-4a43-bdec-820f6b9b38c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188048,"FileName":"c33a2ad6-9afd-4a2e-ae97-9c357221669b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188048,"FileName":"b6657645-5d00-4ac9-97e3-e7e954e02749.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188048,"FileName":"9715b883-f87c-42e0-907d-57a3b6cd9e7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188049,"Name":"Xevious","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"A hundred thousand years ago, an ancient civilization prospered on our Earth, their product being GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer). In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Dempa Shimbunsha","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188049,"FileName":"b7f309ac-e1aa-4a8c-a1af-5793dfe0cf7c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188049,"FileName":"f43368dd-7a60-4c81-858a-ddd9c76961c4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188049,"FileName":"f790c1c0-43b7-4964-83d8-576be288df86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188049,"FileName":"4973fae3-a437-4d12-86d8-0763a2ce0915.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193289,"Name":"Yakyuu Kyou","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193289,"FileName":"4356193a-8781-45d1-8d5a-1d9bbf28c1af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193289,"FileName":"1d02b455-6286-4d4c-9bf1-4af5527a6091.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193289,"FileName":"7973a8db-ed81-47ae-a781-6eb1055476a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190234,"Name":"Yamanote-sen Adventure","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"1983-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190234,"FileName":"61171b94-a1f6-45de-93e9-0325c03dff85.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190234,"FileName":"ee778944-9107-4be5-ad0f-9694303149a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190234,"FileName":"7fab4f29-4ec5-44b2-8854-f48e8addb2c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190234,"FileName":"820171d9-65b9-4483-9b8c-c37dd14832bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190234,"FileName":"ef2c265e-2a9d-43eb-9747-5a2ec02d738f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195322,"Name":"Yami no Iyo Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"You're a spiritual detective Shura and being requested to help Metropolitan Police Department to investigate murder of a man who was sucked all the blood off and death of a girl in a different prefecture.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Hot-B","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195322,"FileName":"7e0c0bb1-180e-4c2d-98b4-f4e424099c66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195322,"FileName":"ad8c8392-ac7c-46f1-8ced-1e19de42c9a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195322,"FileName":"50f63ad7-895d-4699-8f41-8d6e3057d60e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190230,"Name":"Yanpara Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM-7","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190230,"FileName":"416d5277-c189-4a5d-a64c-b08e07d9b892.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190230,"FileName":"a2d1cadc-d634-45bf-a4ef-666681635e23.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190230,"FileName":"5328ca0f-a364-410b-bd8b-5a90945dafb6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190230,"FileName":"964b3420-3919-4aff-9420-fabb38bca7c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195323,"Name":"Yellow Lemon","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Yellow Lemon is a simple text-based simulation game consisting entirely of conversations with four school girls.

The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs.\n\nThe sequel offers a longer quest than the first installment, and adds a magic arsenal to Adol's abilities. Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies.
