While testing the product Morlock inexplicably finds himself in the spaceship within the game. A hyperspace accident clones him thirty times. Each of the clones departs, taking with him a portion of a vital fluid that sustains Morlock's life. Assuming the persona of the brave Captain Blood, the programmer tracks down and disintegrated twenty-five clones, spending 800 years to achieve that goal. However, five clones still remain, hidden somewhere in the depths of the galaxy. Captain Blood must find these clones and destroy them before he loses his own life.\n\nCaptain Blood is an open-ended first-person adventure game. Much of the game consists of traveling to various planets and communicating with the aliens there to gather clues concerning the clones' whereabouts. The player commands a biological ship called Ark, and must launch probes onto planet surfaces, successfully navigating them through the landscape to locate an alien. The Ark can also scan planets and sometimes teleport aliens to different locations.\n\nConversations with the aliens are conducted via the so-called UPCOM interface. Over 150 icons are available to represent different concepts. Since each alien speaks his own language, the player must input various combinations of the icons to be able to understand the alien and communicate with him. Successfully concluding conversations may offer clues or unlock other planets. The protagonist's health deteriorates over the time, which affects the game's interface by making it more difficult to control. These symptoms may be reverted by disintegrating a clone.","Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FkBN3nwmP1E","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Captain_Blood_(video_game)"},"124993":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Silicon Beach Software, Inc.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"43ebaafe-e7b6-4a5a-aa14-2c14578b970e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a0cbf4f-e93c-412a-9eb1-76ff07b16ef2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dac56365-0ffd-4e96-899e-a4d7b0061073.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"773d7151-4653-4eb1-9996-4cf46eddbe39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dark Castle","Overview":"Dark Castle was originally created for the Macintosh in black and white in 1986.

Chahi developed his own game engine, completing all the game's art and animations in vector form to reduce memory use, with some use of rotoscoping to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.\n\nAnother World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success.

Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the \"Actisource\" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden. In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

A triangle is created when three stones are positioned so that they can be connected with straight lines. All of the stones that are located within the triangle can then be captured if the player chooses to. When making a capture, both the player's own stones and those of the opponents are removed from the board. The player's own stones can be brought back into play while the opponents' are permanently out. To win the game the player has to become the last one still able to make a move (due to still having stones left).","Publisher":"California Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bSjHT_inCFQ"},"136991":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Richard L.

It is the second entry in the Test Drive series of video games.\n\nLike the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent.\n\nThe player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use an automatic or manual transmission—the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player’s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course.\n\nThe goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, and thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left.\n\nPolice cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player’s car, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn’t cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.","Publisher":"Accolade","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"136995":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Miami Software","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"2d7e331a-c474-42df-93ab-a595c13607cf.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0f9c277c-1a6c-42d3-b56c-c36941b51296.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b29d8b5-867c-40ba-9303-5a8ae39b4bff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"19d167f5-f5c7-4af4-945a-0b679979995a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f5e05690-7bc3-4ccd-949a-4ab2b9f41139.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Teenage Queen","Overview":"Teenage Queen is quite simply strip poker.

Total sales are believed to be around 200,000 to date, not including the many compilations it has been included in.\n\nlayers of the original game are never told the hero's name, but are instead asked to enter their own. The default name of \"Roger Wilco\" — a reference to the radio communication, \"Roger, Will Comply\" — became the de facto name of the hero in the later games of the series.\n\nRoger's name was fitting in that, in keeping with his portrayal as an \"everyman\" schlub, he took his name from incorrect radio usage. When someone says \"Wilco,\" or \"will comply,\" \"Roger\" (or \"received\") is assumed. There is no need to say \"Roger, wilco,\" and this is seen in aviation circles as the mark of an amateur.\n\nRoger is a member of the cleaning crew on board the scientific spaceship Arcada, which holds a powerful experimental device called the \"Star Generator\" (a thinly-veiled reference to the Genesis Device from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). Roger emerges from an on-duty nap in a broom closet to find that the ship has been boarded and seized by the sinister Sariens. Using a keycard that he found from the body of a dead crew member, he finds his way to an escape pod and escapes the Arcada.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1986-09-18T00:00:00-07:00"},"137009":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"04b38bd0-5074-457b-9726-5b8eac8d538d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3cb095f1-42b5-4c0d-8869-79f3be70883e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3a8e4158-c883-4efe-aa26-615733f08801.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Space Fox","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"137010":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c0910682-f6cc-4433-a32c-506b2db46c2d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cba61d4d-eb2f-41dc-87f0-29b446216db4.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"58b5caf2-a388-404e-ab59-f75c8c7eb32d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb713388-9e8a-4477-9994-9aae6c71c7ce.jpg","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Space Ace","Overview":"Space Ace is a laserdisc video game produced by Don Bluth Studios, Cinematronics and Advanced Microcomputer Systems (later renamed RDI Video Systems).

You start each day with a choice of what to do to fill it.

Fortunately, however, there is an option to slow down the hand by simply invoking, if you're quick on the button, a famous Stooges slapstick scene involving poking eyes and kicking knees. To raise money you can work at a restaurant serving pies, work a hospital, place Curly in a boxing ring, find stray cash on the street or again volunteer Curly to eat at an oyster eating competition. Control can be from either the keypad with open apple as the fire button or joystick.\n\nGiven time, The Three Stooges is a game you can easily master.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.","Publisher":"Empire Software","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-19T00:00:00-07:00"},"137057":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"63ff5ba1-0b4b-4b48-af1a-c71c828a9622.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e19d778-3d17-407b-9fa7-4e94883f1345.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0f8d12f1-0dd0-43ed-a2ca-05e410fc555a.png","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel","Overview":"Police Quest are a series of police simulation video games produced and published by Sierra On-Line between 1987 and 1998.

It is the first product in the Carmen Sandiego franchise. The game was distributed with The World Almanac and Book of Facts, published by Pharos Books. An enhanced version of the game was released in 1989, which did not have the almanac copy protection but disk based copy protection. A deluxe version was released in 1992, and featured additional animation and a reworked interface from the original version. Some of the bonus features include: \"digitized photos from National Geographic, over 3200 clues, music from the Smithsonian\/Folkways Recordings, 20 villains, 60 countries, and 16 maps\". CD-ROM versions for MS-DOS and Macintosh were released in 1992, and a Windows version was released in 1994.\n\nIn the game, the player takes the role of a rookie in the ACME Detective Agency, tasked to track down crooks from the V.I.L.E. organization that have stolen famous works from around the world. They do this by using their knowledge of geography (aided by the Almanac) to question witnesses or investigate clues to track down where the crook has gone. Successfully solving these crimes increases the player's rank in ACME, leading to more difficult cases and later tasked to find the lead of V.I.L.E., Carmen Sandiego.\n\nThe game was initially developed as a menu-driven interface to replace the text-driven interface of adventure games like Colossal Cave Adventure for graphic-enabled computers like the Apple II. Along the way, the idea of introducing geography as part of the game and distributing the Almanac with the game shifted its approach. While it was not intended as an education game at release, the game proved very successful as an education tool for schools. By 1995, over 4 million copies of the game had been sold, and established the Carmen Sandiego franchise. The game was later adapted into a PBS game show that ran from 1991 to 1995. This game is not to be confused with the 1996 rebooted version sometimes mistakenly called the \"Deluxe\" version.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F_(1985_video_game)"},"176343":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cobra Cavern","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Greg Hale","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"d6fa3a08-49d1-4164-96a4-bb16796e800a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7590d98c-7034-4c66-b019-7f2a0fdc1a29.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"52120122-c9bf-4bb0-a797-2c18d7ef33c4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5ee4b848-f7f0-4a53-b10e-8ca104032304.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9f6395ba-7591-4d07-b3bd-f69712f20278.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0cb7f148-b5b2-4c8e-84cb-dd1077fdd381.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7227334d-ab67-46b6-8e7c-abb5d00a405c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fabe5b71-b04a-4934-9658-f484334e3f42.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cavern Cobra","Overview":"Cavern Cobra is a shoot 'em up that is similar to Scramble but with no scrolling.

It was to go hand in hand with a new gaming peripheral, the Future Pad. The Future Pad was shaped like a mouse pad and it calculated the distance of the player's hand from the device. \n\nThe game is somewhat similar to Marble Madness; your goal is to move a metal ball through an obstacle course. You move the ball with the mouse and jump with the future pad.\n\nUntil recently, without the Future Pad, Future Shock was nothing more than a collectible piece of novelty software. The game ships with demo mode, so you can at least see how the game should be played. However the community has recently patched the game to replace Future Pad with a joystick, making the game playable for those of us without the peripheral.","Publisher":"Neeka Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"195162":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lawrence Productions, Inc.","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"cb363728-8641-4249-8051-7f1a053f8acd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a405364-9561-4669-b8a5-9cb21b33b226.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9ec1b3e3-e3f7-420c-bd51-40ffa1a8590b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e5d5a848-4126-4995-9c69-ca8d1b7b9a07.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f3e3fe01-1344-4f21-b05d-94f7752f93d8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e3a13254-617f-46c9-8660-c2da7e27cbfe.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6614b283-998f-4c68-bcf3-4d0cd3bbda0c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"McGee","Overview":"McGee is an educational game for young children (ages 2 to 6). The game is entirely wordless and tells its story through graphics and sound making it possible for the child to play the game without help from an adult. The idea is that the child in this way should become familiar and confident with the computer and grow a sense of discovery.\n\nIn the game the player takes control of a child protagonist called McGee and gets to explore his home. The house consists of a couple of rooms and in each room there are a few objects that can be interacted with. All interaction is done by clicking on the four different icons that appear in each room. When doing so a short animation will start and McGee will do something, for example play with a ball, take a bath or hide under the carpet. There is no specific objective to the game and the player can move around freely between the rooms and interact with things over and over again.","Publisher":"Lawrence Productions, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d8Ac-odCGjo&ab_channel=Alshoff","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/McGee_(video_game_series)"},"195167":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Senseless Violence 1 & 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pangea Software","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"87b77dd7-97ab-431e-bd48-c75dccaf8eb6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b2b18e69-837f-4843-b83d-9b3816494378.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Senseless Violence I: Survival of the Fetus","Overview":"Senseless Violence 1 is an excellent variation on Frogger.

It also marked their last work for the IIGS.\n\nThe first game, Journey to Calibus, is a top down vertical shooter in the tradition of Xevious. This in itself was a bold move, because the IIGS has never been known for smooth scrolling of large areas. Technically, the game comes off 'all right', although gameplay can really drag when there's a lot of action going on. An accelerator card can help with this however.\n\nThe game can only be played with a joystick. The gameplay itself is OK - it becomes a little too repetitive although it does offer the chance to increase your firepower and take on bosses at the end of every level. And if you want, you can make your own levels with the built in level editor.\n\nThe second game, Naxos, places players in an Operation Wolf style scenario whereby you use the mouse to blow away the hostile alien fauna and flora you encounter in a god forsaken alien jungle.\n\nThe game itself is let down by its gameplay - the graphics, music and programming are all first rate, but the game becomes incredibly difficult and unnecessarily frustrating when it comes to ammunition, which drops from the top of the screen in the form of cherries. However, they drop so damn fast, they are very difficult to shoot. This does become easier on later levels, when the screen fills up with nasties and the game slows down under the weight of the action, and the cherries with it, but even still, chances are you will end up dying because you ran out of ammunition.\n\nCosmocade includes an operating system but can run happily from System 6 as well.","Publisher":"Pangea Software, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"195263":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Olivier Goguel et al","Genres":"Puzzle","MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bouncin' Ferno","Publisher":"Free Tools Association","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QifF3oBW_x8&ab_channel=s2325"},"197293":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Miami Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"b7cde21e-e1dc-4d1f-98cd-d169e2b4e6d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"43547cec-0dd5-4141-8e77-c037abc18d8b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sensei","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"197294":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Senseless Violence 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pangea Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Name":"Senseless Violence II: You Use, You Die","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990}}
