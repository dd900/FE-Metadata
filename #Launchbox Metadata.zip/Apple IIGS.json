The task is clear, but by no means easy: locate the Ur-Grue and return the Coconut of Quendor to its rightful owners!\n\nBeyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor introduces a somewhat different gameplay system compared to the previous text adventures of the Zork series. Text-based interaction and puzzle-solving are still present; however, role-playing elements have been added to the mix. The player character has six attributes assigned to him: endurance, strength, dexterity, intelligence, compassion, and luck. These can be determined by the player at the beginning of the game, randomly chosen by the game, or provided as part of a pre-generated character.

The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces. Similarly, in Blockout, the player manipulates a set of polycubes which fall into a three-dimensional pit (seen from above; the pieces appear in the foreground and fall away). The pieces can be rotated around all three axes, and moved horizontally and vertically. The aim is to form complete layers.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlxAGx212C4","Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"P.Z.Karen Co.

While testing the product Morlock inexplicably finds himself in the spaceship within the game. A hyperspace accident clones him thirty times. Each of the clones departs, taking with him a portion of a vital fluid that sustains Morlock's life. Assuming the persona of the brave Captain Blood, the programmer tracks down and disintegrated twenty-five clones, spending 800 years to achieve that goal. However, five clones still remain, hidden somewhere in the depths of the galaxy. Captain Blood must find these clones and destroy them before he loses his own life.\n\nCaptain Blood is an open-ended first-person adventure game. Much of the game consists of traveling to various planets and communicating with the aliens there to gather clues concerning the clones' whereabouts. The player commands a biological ship called Ark, and must launch probes onto planet surfaces, successfully navigating them through the landscape to locate an alien. The Ark can also scan planets and sometimes teleport aliens to different locations.\n\nConversations with the aliens are conducted via the so-called UPCOM interface. Over 150 icons are available to represent different concepts. Since each alien speaks his own language, the player must input various combinations of the icons to be able to understand the alien and communicate with him. Successfully concluding conversations may offer clues or unlock other planets. The protagonist's health deteriorates over the time, which affects the game's interface by making it more difficult to control. These symptoms may be reverted by disintegrating a clone.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkBN3nwmP1E","Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Mindscape Inc.","Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"9d27a763-e462-49d3-a554-e419f53d332c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"e0ed7a84-be43-48c0-8b9e-239884a0bd9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"d631624d-98ca-4e88-b652-d30dd1a7ce73.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"0066c7bd-0d5a-40f3-8c1b-e788991c2479.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"f815c486-cdd5-4ec1-933a-150842f8fb8a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"a248ecd6-9797-4c98-ae3b-83d8f24de7d8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124992,"FileName":"1e2109c9-23d8-400f-87e9-b4ea163a4468.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176343,"Name":"Cavern Cobra","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Cavern Cobra is a shoot 'em up that is similar to Scramble but with no scrolling.

It also marked their last work for the IIGS.\n\nThe first game, Journey to Calibus, is a top down vertical shooter in the tradition of Xevious. This in itself was a bold move, because the IIGS has never been known for smooth scrolling of large areas. Technically, the game comes off 'all right', although gameplay can really drag when there's a lot of action going on. An accelerator card can help with this however.\n\nThe game can only be played with a joystick. The gameplay itself is OK - it becomes a little too repetitive although it does offer the chance to increase your firepower and take on bosses at the end of every level. And if you want, you can make your own levels with the built in level editor.\n\nThe second game, Naxos, places players in an Operation Wolf style scenario whereby you use the mouse to blow away the hostile alien fauna and flora you encounter in a god forsaken alien jungle.\n\nThe game itself is let down by its gameplay - the graphics, music and programming are all first rate, but the game becomes incredibly difficult and unnecessarily frustrating when it comes to ammunition, which drops from the top of the screen in the form of cherries. However, they drop so damn fast, they are very difficult to shoot. This does become easier on later levels, when the screen fills up with nasties and the game slows down under the weight of the action, and the cherries with it, but even still, chances are you will end up dying because you ran out of ammunition.\n\nCosmocade includes an operating system but can run happily from System 6 as well.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Pangea Software","Publisher":"Pangea Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195169,"FileName":"62d6638d-187a-4836-b2b3-0e999fe89da6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":195169,"FileName":"7d909bdd-301a-43a1-86f3-a669f0e2cb67.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":195169,"FileName":"3f732f42-e7aa-48fb-82a7-4e84ac37c3a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":195169,"FileName":"2b3a45bf-5b7f-44f5-840e-a40e853875fa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":195169,"FileName":"28c7952c-390d-4060-b3a9-52a83bf734e3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136893,"Name":"Crystal Quest","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Crystal Quest is an action computer game for the Apple Macintosh and Apple IIgs.

However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden. In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

The aim of the game is to capture seeds and this happens automatically when the last placed seed in a turn leads to a bowl on the opponent's side of the board having two or three seeds. The player making the move will then capture all seeds in that bowl. If the previous bowl also has two or three seeds these too are captured until a bowl that doesn't contain two or three seeds is reached.

The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.\n\nAnother World was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years, with help with the soundtrack from Jean-François Freitas. Chahi developed his own game engine, completing all the game's art and animations in vector form to reduce memory use, with some use of rotoscoping to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.\n\nAnother World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as Ico, Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, and Delphine's later Flashback.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlejbtpRxWU","Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Interplay","Publisher":"Interplay","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":134491,"FileName":"eac0ed9d-2a46-4620-ad36-0d58a5c51dde.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134491,"FileName":"f4cf81fe-de60-4f3b-9314-8e8ce66f61d0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137054,"Name":"Panzer Battles","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Panzer Battles is a hex board game style WWII war game.

Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124591,"FileName":"0f3ad405-3e48-4d8a-892d-1e8a9c56ca30.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":124591,"FileName":"63c95725-cc1b-404d-8fd9-9e71e7dee489.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":124591,"FileName":"28e30cf5-f23b-42df-9344-e25327630d8d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124591,"FileName":"c2745365-1ec0-4beb-9501-65b0cc9ee153.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124591,"FileName":"e11fb204-fe17-4b4c-b147-5c0ad73f2c39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136994,"Name":"The Duel: Test Drive II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Duel: Test Drive II is a racing game developed by Distinctive Software and published by Accolade in 1989. It is the second entry in the Test Drive series of video games.\n\nLike the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent.\n\nThe player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use an automatic or manual transmission—the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player’s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course.\n\nThe goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, and thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left.\n\nPolice cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player’s car, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn’t cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Distinctive Software","Publisher":"Accolade","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136994,"FileName":"fbce72de-5713-43b7-adee-039afe782d9b.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136994,"FileName":"bac034bd-8a2c-46cf-af57-c3204ed44649.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136994,"FileName":"57e0525c-71b9-4d7c-9cd6-87269ee29685.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124995,"Name":"The Fidelity: Chessmaster 2100","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Chessmaster is a chess-playing computer game series which is now owned and developed by Ubisoft.

Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, the game offers a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. \n\nThe dungeon isn't empty: some friendly characters may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, but you may restart each level as often as you like.

The game is available for up to four players who take turns placing stones on the board. The aim is to capture the stones of the opponents by creating triangles. A triangle is created when three stones are positioned so that they can be connected with straight lines. All of the stones that are located within the triangle can then be captured if the player chooses to. When making a capture, both the player's own stones and those of the opponents are removed from the board. The player's own stones can be brought back into play while the opponents' are permanently out. To win the game the player has to become the last one still able to make a move (due to still having stones left).","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSjHT_inCFQ","Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Logical Design Works, Inc., P.Z.Karen Co.

It is the first product in the Carmen Sandiego franchise. The game was distributed with The World Almanac and Book of Facts, published by Pharos Books. An enhanced version of the game was released in 1989, which did not have the almanac copy protection but disk based copy protection. A deluxe version was released in 1992, and featured additional animation and a reworked interface from the original version. Some of the bonus features include: \"digitized photos from National Geographic, over 3200 clues, music from the Smithsonian/Folkways Recordings, 20 villains, 60 countries, and 16 maps\". CD-ROM versions for MS-DOS and Macintosh were released in 1992, and a Windows version was released in 1994.\n\nIn the game, the player takes the role of a rookie in the ACME Detective Agency, tasked to track down crooks from the V.I.L.E. organization that have stolen famous works from around the world. They do this by using their knowledge of geography (aided by the Almanac) to question witnesses or investigate clues to track down where the crook has gone. Successfully solving these crimes increases the player's rank in ACME, leading to more difficult cases and later tasked to find the lead of V.I.L.E., Carmen Sandiego.\n\nThe game was initially developed as a menu-driven interface to replace the text-driven interface of adventure games like Colossal Cave Adventure for graphic-enabled computers like the Apple II. Along the way, the idea of introducing geography as part of the game and distributing the Almanac with the game shifted its approach. While it was not intended as an education game at release, the game proved very successful as an education tool for schools. By 1995, over 4 million copies of the game had been sold, and established the Carmen Sandiego franchise. The game was later adapted into a PBS game show that ran from 1991 to 1995. This game is not to be confused with the 1996 rebooted version sometimes mistakenly called the \"Deluxe\" version.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"83cf089f-3507-4a62-b297-df9612b43141.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"97a9fca3-6425-4ada-8f37-c6602f7d8523.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"72745fd6-113a-4768-baa1-1dfa8179c609.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"cfbfedf8-f24d-4b28-aeae-3219bb4559a8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"b780a782-93f6-4ef9-b927-20ebdec17cb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"0ec953b3-ccdf-40b6-96b9-658230c7ac7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"c121e1e5-37ea-4e7b-ad5e-f9050c78c1ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"d0638456-f959-46f1-9456-82a136905a39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"244e0261-67c8-446b-8c39-9bc96661f361.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"ef8a5d19-b067-4496-967c-7c487cb9bf73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"617be6da-94d9-47ad-ba4f-56221e2ddc09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164907,"FileName":"2dde8bf2-d60c-4b96-82ee-222b6c509fae.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164907,"AlternateName":"carmnwld","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":136529,"Name":"Windwalker","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"The sequel to Moebius, Windwalker combines role-playing with side-view beat 'em up gameplay.

To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator. Levels—ten in the original episodes—are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire chain gun. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAuRbppncN4","Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Vitesse","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"1996-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153591,"FileName":"4cd67936-3bac-407e-ba5c-c1e176a5964a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":153591,"FileName":"e75b3006-81a7-40ff-ac4d-e44ab87d64d9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":153591,"FileName":"8fa41b33-4935-4631-b618-f932a886b276.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136573,"Name":"World Games","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"World Games is an Olympics-style sports game with arcade-oriented gameplay.\n\n The events players can compete in include:\n\n•   Barrel jumping\n•   Bull riding\n•   Caber toss\n•   Cliff diving\n•   Log rolling\n•   Platform diving\n•   Pole vault\n•   Skiing\n•   Sumo wrestling\n•   Weightlifting","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Epyx","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":136573,"FileName":"824ab309-ed21-4c13-8909-36cd93954e47.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136573,"FileName":"3a934087-88f9-4923-9d49-97853eaccae8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136573,"FileName":"37f8b9e8-a93c-4d4c-ac07-2d0e4ecbb428.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136528,"Name":"World Tour Golf","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"World Tour Golf (WTG) is an 1986 computer game by Evan and Nicky Robinson, Paul Reiche III and published by Electronic Arts (EA) for Commodore 64, Amiga, Apple IIGS and DOS.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":136528,"FileName":"e3e2952f-ef80-4d5e-94c8-fab765a35f9f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136528,"FileName":"1c35165c-8859-4c79-a57a-8e1110d25627.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136527,"Name":"Xenocide","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Aliens have taken over the three moons orbiting your home planet, and your mission is to blow them up (not just the aliens, but the entire moons!).\n\nEach moon contains four levels incorporating several gameplay modes and perspective","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple IIGS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Pangea Software","Publisher":"Micro Revelations, Inc","ReleaseDate":"1987-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136527,"FileName":"92eba976-41d3-4457-9836-552f22e6414f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136527,"FileName":"49808542-f081-4e2e-bb96-aff6203d9674.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136527,"FileName":"c1974e14-5663-40e3-a1ea-cc1ee733777c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136527,"FileName":"1208174f-abde-4b22-a3c1-bdc0e8738445.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136526,"Name":"Zany Golf","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Zany Golf, also known as Will Harvey's Zany Golf, is a 1988 video game with a fantasy take on miniature golf, developed by Sandcastle Productions and published by Electronic Arts.
