Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.\n\nGuilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sammy Atomiswave","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Arc System Works","Publisher":"Sammy Studios","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"61c455f0-8771-4dde-82e9-5783dcca469d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"2ee4ca3c-82bb-441c-abb2-0f34f5896250.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"d985969b-de11-4d49-b9e0-4baa88f66086.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"634f571d-0310-44cb-98d0-ff0bc25417f7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"0eb997a2-b668-41d4-902d-9f8deb8c7ded.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"9dc75c9e-6a8c-44bc-8738-fe35b98522aa.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"2a21f6cc-a275-4c5e-8e01-d4993acc3096.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"d05bc6c8-cd42-4df8-8f83-52363822fcef.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"0a4a79ca-43ab-4cb5-8ccc-3eb0cb517a31.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"9b6966ae-3bae-47dc-8973-e18c68651d7e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"b1558e04-c826-48fa-b0d1-8ac380372692.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"eb191d43-5fbe-410b-883e-095b5b440cf8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91849,"FileName":"5cf2edcc-b0ba-4812-bb07-81ef02cc3e4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":91849,"AlternateName":"Guilty Gear X Ver. 1.5","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":14958,"Name":"Kenju","ReleaseYear":"2004","Overview":"KenJu, an unreleased arcade game from 2005 that had been thought lost.

The storyline is reminiscent of Metal Slug 2, X, and 3, as it focuses on the Rebel-Martian alliance where the team, with the help of the Rebels, had to fight the Martians. In this version however, all sides team up to combat a threat together. The four original heroes, Marco, Tarma, Fio and Eri, are joined by Ralf and Clark, of King of Fighters and Ikari Warriors fame, each with different attributes and a special ability. The characters also vary by running speed, the defense abilities when driving vehicles, and the amount of ammo received.\n\nThe characters can now carry two power-ups at the same time, and choose to discard one, or give it to another player in the Co-op mode. Next to new drivable vehicles, there is also a new weapon, the Zantetsu Sword, a blade that neutralizes enemy firepower. An additional melee attack has been added, and the sliding technique from the previous game has been removed.\n\nWhen enemies are killed at a fast rate, more points are received, and this is reflected by a meter at the bottom of the screen. When the meter maxes out, enemies drop coins. Two new difficulty levels have been added: Easy and Hard. In the Easy mode, the fifth and final level cannot be accessed, but instead of the pistol, the default weapon is the heavy machine gun with unlimited ammo. Next to the main Arcade Mode, there is Combat School, a modified version where skills are tested.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sammy Atomiswave","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"SNK Playmore","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2006-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"d4c9c95d-deb1-48ca-bb2b-03e2a80f2581.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"c0a722f7-3704-451e-8fed-b11a1d909f15.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"b6f59cf0-e9ea-4631-be65-093e04d7b1c4.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"e485c835-365b-4d25-a967-714da1701cf0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"72f3a896-301c-4898-86a6-68506e71bbb5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"ff580fd5-b967-486b-b930-d87b466fc975.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"9774ce63-84f1-4f79-9e0d-25ac8af16706.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"0b955fae-a1db-4107-b49b-6b0c49350815.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"beb8c080-2379-40cf-864e-fb6febdb58f3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"aad59de8-70b5-47ef-a52c-1ae9d3f265ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91854,"FileName":"b39cfbdd-b3e9-473a-925d-a939b2f035c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":172368,"Name":"Miracle Stadium","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sammy Atomiswave","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Sammy","Publisher":"Sammy","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172368,"FileName":"da10f028-f7cf-477b-9f2c-eb69da3d1b16.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172368,"FileName":"3d5fb99e-ca14-4d43-aa37-f8b07e989e33.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91855,"Name":"NeoGeo Battle Coliseum","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In February, 2017 of the new Japanese era there is a man trying to rule the NEOGEO World. \"I will topple NeoGeo's most powerful warriors and put myself on the throne!\".

It was the first game SNK Playmore produced for the Atomiswave. An offshoot of The King of Fighters series, it is not counted in the main series numbering. The character artwork was done by Tomokazu Nakano (of Power Instinct fame).\n\nLike KOF '98 and KOF 2002, Neowave has no actual storyline, but is instead a \"Dream Match\" which gathers numerous characters from various past KOF games, regardless of their status in the overarching storyline. The character roster of the arcade version is similar to the Neo Geo version of KOF 2002, with a few differences in the team placement. The KOF 2000 Team and the KOF 2001 Team are eliminated from the lineup, and a Mixed Team is introduced, composed of Saisyu Kusanagi, Kula Diamond, and Shingo Yabuki. King replaces May Lee in the Women Fighters Team, while Jhun Hoon replaces Kim Kaphwan in the Korean Team. Kim, along with Vanessa and Ramon, are still featured in the arcade version as hidden characters, along with the Orochi versions of the KOF '97 New Faces Team. Geese Howard appears in the game as the main boss character, with this incarnation of the character being based on his younger self from Art of Fighting 2.\n\nThe game reverts to the 3-character elimination system from KOF '94 to KOF '98, ignoring gameplay features from later games such as the \"Striker\" system used from KOF '99 through KOF 2001 and tag team system in KOF 2003. The game's graphics consist of 2D character sprites overlaid over polygonal 3D backgrounds (similar to the 3D stages featured in the console versions of previous games in the series such as the Dreamcast versions of KOF '98).\n\nWith the change of hardware from Neo Geo to Atomiswave, the number of buttons is now increased to five. In addition to the standard four attack buttons used in the previous games, a fifth button is now added which is used to activate the Heat Mode.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FW2qB82t-M","Platform":"Sammy Atomiswave","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK Playmore","Publisher":"Sammy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"96e6ce23-d184-4e25-9e2b-e07f010766a2.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"190060a7-39a2-4a0b-a53f-be0c548842c5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"48425983-b100-4c6a-9791-b0f8197905e6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"3af17bcd-866b-4866-9fcc-2be995c2530f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"a79e4e51-50d2-4220-b0ff-1c5c3801f53b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"48cd1dfa-50c6-44d9-a6bd-036d3108939b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"cc157b25-ced5-4feb-9cfb-489eb9741ea5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"f8e26827-2abf-4dee-8247-6257232a5243.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91850,"FileName":"7712abd5-fcbb-4c76-b6e7-bff3a908b43a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91851,"Name":"The King of Fighters XI","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The King of Fighters XI is a 2D fighting game produced by SNK Playmore originally released as a coin-operated arcade game for the Atomiswave platform in 2005.

The Offense and Defense gauges have been divided into three sections each, allowing for more usage of Offensive and Defensive Arts, as well as techniques tied to each gauge. An addition to the system is the Boost Dive, which puts each character into a powered-up state according to their style. Most characters have had modifications to their movelists in some way, such as new moves and new commands for old moves.\n\nReturning characters include Zen, Hikari, Typhon, Garnet, Orville, Boyd, Viren, Kaya, and Aran. Greed is a secret character, playable only after inputting a password in the operator options.\n\n\nNew characters:\n\n• Sheryl - A calm, stoic assassin whose fighting style is based upon the use of wires and setting traps across the screen.\n\n• Mito - A young girl who fights with a wooden bokken. She fights with two different styles: one with wide, sweeping attacks, and one with short, stabbing attacks.\n\n• Bazoo - An over 8 ft tall large man who is caged and seemingly used for sport, which has taken a toll on his mind. He has long range with his arms, and using all kinds of debris to his advantage.\n\n• Lud - Leader of the Valour Gang with a Gauntlet attached to his arm. He focuses on rapid, dashing attacks. He also can guard and absorb any attack with a special gauntlet of his.\n\n• Hazama - He works under PROBE-NEXUS' CEO. He has strong attacks and a somewhat long range. Hazama is also playable, but only after inputting a password in the operator options.\n\n• Beatrice - PROBE-NEXUS' new chairman, and a relative of Vlad. She is powerful, with the ability to project long range waves. She is also playable after inputting the operator password, then inputting a code on the character select screen. However, the playable version of Beatrice is significantly less powerful than her final boss counterpart.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/9uGaG_Cpcck","Platform":"Sammy Atomiswave","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Dimps","Publisher":"Sammy","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"04cd2b3b-8f31-4965-a8ee-a8c70a08df45.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"3424339b-21ab-4402-b947-4b2bd74f9ea6.png","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"e2d9a415-9ada-43b7-85f5-1d2e70923fe9.png","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"604e2e12-7339-44e2-8dc9-eafeebd55155.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"ce8e9231-9d5f-4284-b088-239bf764f79a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"9657412e-1eff-4df9-bb9f-2b7f04a9978b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"8ba88929-53bf-4739-8c8e-09a8fb50937e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"38c0f196-3e27-4ad4-8121-28c43b6dea4f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"0735cda5-63c5-4c8f-8bbb-e61647970b73.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"4a91f251-8dab-402a-b6f9-f4f81760d972.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"cdc8cb9f-d243-4a0b-8e88-1f577d7a9b42.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"ebc679f1-303e-45b8-97e1-21968d2df8e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91858,"FileName":"da087db7-8d88-4241-8b9d-d108bf843caa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158213,"Name":"WaiWai Drive","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"WaiWai Drive is cartoon stylized race car game for children and released in Japan for the Atomiswave arcade system.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es5MginSl-o","Platform":"Sammy Atomiswave","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Moss","Publisher":"Sammy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"65969346-60b0-4ad9-b8b5-02255c7b2c83.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"5fc20d7c-cebf-4c82-932b-71a9c310f0c8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"909ea33c-06a2-4269-acf1-869f94d6adbf.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"6a27b25d-c682-4d20-a2b1-6f8a25a33e92.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"1bca8e30-0776-400e-849c-83a4caac404e.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"ef312927-15cd-4eea-ba0b-3b811fae67a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"bf8f6adb-e05e-4ef4-866c-7b2597ff3b34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"2619e3eb-949b-4c9c-adac-ad53579add17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158213,"FileName":"b944b927-634e-4b8c-af35-23151d5af4b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":158213,"AlternateName":"WaiWai Drive","Region":"Japan"}]}]}
