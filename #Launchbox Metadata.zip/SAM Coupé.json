The player is presented with a number of tiles layered on top of each other and the aim of the game is to have them removed by matching tiles with the same symbol and colour. To match a tile it has to be visible but unlike other mahjongg solitaire games it does not need to have free space to the sides. If the player gets stuck he has to use the quit button and replay the level while losing a life. Extra lives are given for every 20,000 points reached or by completing a level within a time limit. Some special tiles exist which affect other tiles when matched. There are bombs which destroy four neighbours, twirlers which rotates adjacent tiles and flippers which swap the positions of tiles.\n\nThe Viking Game is based on the board game Tafl and is played by two players (no AI option exist). One player has 24 black pieces while the other has 12 white ones plus one king. The white pieces are located in the centre of the screen while the black ones are located by the sides. The white's objective is to move the king piece to one of four corners of the board. The black's objective is to capture the white king by placing black pieces on all four sides of the king. The pieces move like a rook in chess, any number of steps either horizontally or vertically, and are captured by being sandwiched by pieces of the other colour.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SAM Coupé","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"FRED Publishing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182891,"FileName":"804d0d3f-1aea-44f3-95b2-26f9f911834e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182891,"FileName":"d9a5b6a8-608f-4a84-8eca-d8a51e94d4e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182891,"FileName":"c8f548a3-e5cf-4456-9212-31dc645ac7ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182891,"FileName":"f0c6db8a-0978-4d4c-aa6a-85dcb55c8a34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182891,"FileName":"8f1f531a-2eb2-4b8a-b531-33405d392167.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182891,"FileName":"8f8bf8e2-10b5-4703-9f9e-9f66f49f04ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182892,"Name":"Klax","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"An action/puzzle game, the object is to catch assorted color falling tiles and create rows, columns, or diagonals of a single color.

The game has twelve levels and each one ends with a boss fight against a powerful guardian enemy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SAM Coupé","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"FRED Publishing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182896,"FileName":"2a448916-4aa6-400b-a20e-a04735b9fd75.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182896,"FileName":"3f0aeb2f-5238-42d8-87f4-9b9ee1e2dd5c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182896,"FileName":"bcaa80d4-5b9e-4475-be87-3d0034214a93.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182896,"FileName":"bb725533-0c04-433f-93b0-0012f93f0d8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182896,"FileName":"44b8f6f6-aac7-48a6-b00e-b0b5e4c5cdf3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182897,"Name":"Pipe Mania","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SAM Coupé","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Enigma Variations Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182897,"FileName":"05327a53-4efa-418f-9054-16eb12db5fab.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182897,"FileName":"4d12f592-448d-4fa5-84af-ae44f9e9ad9f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182897,"FileName":"29d06cfb-0c09-45d0-8487-fa62ec8e1c70.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182897,"FileName":"5d024f4d-a6c3-4e7c-9a87-800cb8b5dfa2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182897,"FileName":"ab40416e-31f7-4898-a071-4360dfa842e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182898,"Name":"Prince of Persia","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\nPrince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SAM Coupé","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Revelation Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182898,"FileName":"147138c3-0b3c-4e39-aa1f-0be8f34c907a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182898,"FileName":"42c64060-0973-4eb2-91a5-15950bf70312.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182898,"FileName":"1724f1a8-6ec3-47a5-9163-72fecd985ef9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182898,"FileName":"f7e20745-3a97-4be4-814c-042d71bdb0c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182898,"FileName":"b36aeb6e-97d4-4486-847a-fe910ed7159b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182899,"Name":"Quizball","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A general knowledge game, based on the theme (and scoring system) of snooker.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SAM Coupé","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Quiz","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Revelation Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182899,"FileName":"0f86ef7a-a81a-4431-8b2b-ef0731d33dd1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182899,"FileName":"9ef3367b-3864-46ae-9ae5-f301b14ef14d.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182899,"FileName":"489badf3-e09c-4f38-96fb-9b642d464336.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182899,"FileName":"34a59801-ac7a-41fa-864e-f7f7e0338859.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182899,"FileName":"8bb8a0a4-a7ce-4a13-a5ea-6a2e6cdfada5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182900,"Name":"Sam Cards","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Sam Cards is collection of three card games.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SAM Coupé","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"DATON","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182900,"FileName":"a37d1a1a-0f11-4e82-b855-e13111026ff5.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182900,"FileName":"350c5980-58ae-4a3e-867b-969ae36bd850.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182900,"FileName":"91b0a890-4e92-4353-97d2-62fa174b2803.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179796,"Name":"Sphera","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Sphera is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up.
