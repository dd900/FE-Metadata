In 2013, developer ZVitor launched Marvel First Alliance, a beat 'em up created with the OpenBor engine and inspired by classics like Streets of Rage and Double Dragon. It features a Marvel dream team and includes simultaneous four-player action for friends to join in!\n\nThe Story begins with the threat of the malefic organization Hydra, choosing your hero from favorites such as Hulk, Captain America or Thor, among others. More superheroes are unlocked with the defeat of enemy bosses, including Wolverine, Storm, Spiderman, Colossus, Iron Man, Nightcrawler, Cyclops and many more! Each character is not just aesthetically different and faithful to the comic sources; they also have different movement types, speed and special attacks. The traditional side-scrolling gameplay throws lots of enemies at the player until reaching the final boss of each level and the large and diverse cast offers some variety and replayability.\n\nThe game's long development shows in its attention to detail and became a stepping stone for the Brazilian developer, being among the first of many OpenBor releases. A follow-up to this game, Marvel First Alliance 2, was more of an update rather than a sequel, adding more characters, tweaks and fixes to the original.","Publisher":"Zvitor","ReleaseDate":"2013-09-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ajuz7k9wn24","WikipediaURL":"http:\/\/allthetropes.wikia.com\/wiki\/Marvel_First_Alliance_(Video_Game)"},"134519":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Senile Team","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9a67e17b-b3ad-477c-be2f-7e0e1771d236.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74fb8079-3458-485b-839b-9394861d419d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6a7f3063-5899-4e71-8475-03f79b2a52c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cbd09e45-a447-4740-a137-14022faa5dff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Beats of Rage","Overview":"Beats of Rage is an open source brawler fighting game engine.
