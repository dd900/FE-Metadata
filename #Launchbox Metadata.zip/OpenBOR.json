This bloody beat 'em up was created as an OpenBOR project and released in 2017 on ChronoCrash.com. Play as one of six Streets of Rage fighters, including a zombie, and smash your way through hordes of disgustingly awesome mutilated corpses of the undead. With great sprite-based graphics and fast and fluid brawler gameplay, creator suhmai adds a worthy entry into the homebrew OpenBOR database.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"OpenBOR","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Beat 'em Up","Developer":"suhmai","Publisher":"ChronoCrash.com","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"c10f3666-479d-4a1a-aa7c-7714aeaea7b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"0904d958-246a-4cc3-8f17-7a58d21fdd2e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"179491a9-22b0-47f8-90f9-83d16ef25d3e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"9320491e-1833-4687-99b8-29926c2123ec.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"b1c7dde8-2583-48b4-9ccb-916b0f2f93c1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"121896f2-7f4a-4f3a-9e71-eb6e8e0722b7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"e4aeeb4a-7dbd-4b9f-8b79-3df8bebe6536.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200195,"FileName":"42526a40-ec7a-4d1c-9838-90031b8e4e0d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":200195,"AlternateName":"Streets of Rage: Zombies","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163694,"Name":"Streets of Rage: Silent Hill","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Streets of Rage: Silent Hill, a beat'em up developed by OpenBor, takes the classic Streets of Rage and mixes it with environments and characters from the Silent Hill franchise. You'll be able to play as characters from both Silent Hill 1 and 2 (for example, the villain Pyramid Head).\n\nThe gameplay is typical for this genre: you'll walk down the streets of Silent Hill fighting dozens of enemies that will come at you from all angles. Although you'll find objects that heal you, you won't be able to use any weapons.\n\nThe detailed graphics in Streets of Rage: Silent Hill are excellent. Some elements are taken straight from other OpenBor games while others are original and have their own great style. The animations of dead bodies fit perfectly with the game's environment.\n\nStreets of Rage: Silent Hill is a very fun action game that contains enough elements to satisfy both Silent Hill and Streets of Rage fans.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPGz2nNo7Uw","Platform":"OpenBOR","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Beat 'em Up","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163694,"FileName":"3bef3064-db65-4798-a8c4-cf1627aa07f0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":163694,"FileName":"2f7c7d4e-1280-47b0-ab94-7fa7ba196fc0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":163694,"AlternateName":"Silent Rage","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":185601,"Name":"Super Karate Kid","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super Karate Kid is a fan-made remake of the 1987 game for the NES, developed by Merso X using the OpenBOR engine.\n\nDifferences include:\n\n• Updated graphics and sound\n• Background and foreground are easier to distinguish from each other\n• Updated controls: designated buttons for jumping and special attacks\n• Short invincibility period after getting hit avoids getting sandwiched between two enemies\n• New intro and ending sequences\n• Features appearance by arch nemesis Johnny Lawrence","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43z9-5zj0n0","Platform":"OpenBOR","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Merso X Games","Publisher":"Merso X Games","ReleaseDate":"2018-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185601,"FileName":"aef6f6bc-5fa0-4482-83fb-cbe8141db700.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":185601,"FileName":"680c9544-9e1a-4770-a2e8-a36798517376.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":185601,"FileName":"f43e3d16-80c6-4c25-9951-f52d774bb0ad.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200568,"Name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Red Sky Battle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Red Sky Battle is a scrolling fighting game dedicated to the Ninja Turtles.
