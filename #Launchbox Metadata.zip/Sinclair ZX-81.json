The enemies begin at the sides of the screen and move towards the centre where supply pods are located. The pods are protected by barriers that the aliens will remove one piece at a time. Once they have made a whole through they can take the pods and transport them back to the edge of the screen. The player has to prevent them from doing this by shooting them down in time. At the same time he has to watch out for their fire. Some protection is offered by four Space Invaders-esque shields. The player has three lives and loses one when shot or when the aliens recover a pod.
