Like the original, this is a one or two player battle-action game where your jeeps (equipped with rocket launchers) defend war torn landscapes with 16 different terrains that are randomly chosen at the beginning of each level.\n\n\n\nThe play field is a top view of cities with road and building areas defined. Players (jeeps) and enemies (tanks) can only maneuver on the roads, however the enemy helicopter can go over buildings and roads. No shots by anything can go through buildings, as they are only valid over road areas. Debris left by tanks is sometimes destructive, so make sure to shoot them from a safe distance!\n\n\n\nThe object is to accumulate the maximum number of points possible. In a two player game, both players play simultaneously and neither player can shoot the other. The player(s) must avoid being shot or run over by the enemy tanks, and avoid being shot by the helicopter. If a player shoots a helicopter, the bonus level is incremented by 10 points. When the fifth helicopter is destroyed an extra jeep is awarded to the player who shot the helicopter the fifth time. (Bonus Levels: +10, +20, +30, +40, extra jeep and reset to zero). The player's turn is over when he/she gets shot by the tank or helicopter. In a two player game, the level does not reset and the player does not return (if he/she has any lives left) until both players are shot.\n\n\n\nIf a player shoots a tank once, there is a time limit to shoot the turret. If a player does not then shoot the turret, it will explode automatically and no points will be awarded.\n\n\n\nSkill Levels\n\n\n\nEach Skill Level starts the player at different points in the game (including the player's score):\n\n\n\nEasy: On the 'Easy' Skill level, there are fewer tanks, they don't shoot as often, move much slower, the turrets follow you very slowly, and the helicopter doesn't shoot often.\n\nNormal: The 'Normal' skill level is for players who are familiar with the game and features a good balance of difficulty and challenge.\n\nHard: On the 'Hard' skill level, there are many more tanks required to complete a level, they shoot much more often, move quickly, the turrets follow you immediately, and the helicopter shoots much more often as well. If you are able to get through a few of the more difficult levels, a second helicopter is brought out to further hinder you.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Robert DeCrescenzo","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123605,"FileName":"ca9c7d0a-c15d-42b0-8705-e0cbd0d77e90.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123605,"FileName":"53bef0d6-929f-470e-bf42-ef9d4d4053f4.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":123605,"FileName":"1cfbbf80-5460-4306-a470-37b11b2fbaf2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":123605,"FileName":"db001666-0c93-460b-a4a0-42b764614f84.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":123605,"FileName":"563204fb-ae13-43c0-9266-db8a75ac62fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18177,"Name":"Asteroids","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Start blasting!

His first was Beef Drop, which is one of the most accurate ports of the arcade game Burgertime to any classic gaming system.\n\n\n\nThe object of b*nQ is to score as many points as possible by jumping on cubes, jumping on green objects, and luring the Snake to his death. When all of the cubes have been changed to the “change to” color, you will advance to the next round. After every four rounds you will advance to the next level. Later levels require jumping on cubes multiple times and the cubes will change in different color sequences, increasing the challenge of advancing to the next round.\n\n\n\nb*nQ supports one or two players, so you can play alone or with a friend. You can select from one of four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Adept, and Expert, for greater challenges as you become better at the game. You can also choose whether your joystick operates in \"rotated\" mode (where you rotate the joystick 45 degrees) or operate it in \"normal\" mode where you use your joystick's diagonals to move b*nQ around the pyramid.\n\n\n\nThe label design for b*nQ was created by Darrin Rose, who won the b*nQ Label Contest held on AtariAge in November 2007. Not only does Darrin's winning design grace the label, but Darrin also created the b*nQ manual, which features more original artwork created just for the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Ken Siders","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124404,"FileName":"d5b64476-6a20-4a73-95d9-6a419959fd4f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124404,"FileName":"9a7a4f85-a953-4718-80ec-08f139a81cee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":124404,"FileName":"9f213a3b-210b-47ee-aa65-9f27b9be06db.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":124404,"FileName":"2bcb42ce-1c0b-434a-a8d1-35ed7f29a5ed.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":124404,"FileName":"f950bf7b-57c6-4457-a399-f10955789752.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":124404,"FileName":"85323777-42fb-4a9d-ae7a-e722ca8eeb1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4893,"Name":"Ballblazer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ballblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer.

Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded \"unbeatable\"(?) pterodactyl.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0euJM0bdN00","Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Williams","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"81506fdb-8004-4521-ba52-aea45343bf9f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"6e88412a-fd92-4963-8146-643a570603a2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"96877d81-e354-4dd8-abf6-4676f14ef3cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"59914419-727e-4852-914f-41b0d9e8ce0f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"29823e61-9b88-417e-942e-e66b95fec4bf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"ec129d7d-ede4-4aa8-a4f6-9024a9b832bd.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"6d18f869-e2c4-4c37-b0e0-2829d3609ad7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4902,"FileName":"0ca0e7c0-8984-4bb0-b3aa-ecae17891734.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125108,"Name":"Jr. Pac-Man","ReleaseYear":"2009","Overview":"I may be young, but I'm no baby!\n\n\n\nI'm a star just like my folks, Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man.

However, Atari had the exclusive home console rights to Pac-Man and sued Philips to force them to cease production of K.C. Munchkin. Although Atari wasn't initially successful, they did ultimately win on appeal, and Philips was forced to halt sales of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Robert DeCrescenzo","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125109,"FileName":"8261d10c-6168-43df-9590-3aff5466baa6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125109,"FileName":"7be49341-025e-4f4f-9f6c-b1943ffa5601.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":125109,"FileName":"46466620-ee3a-4c05-82e1-bbbc2a125841.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":125109,"FileName":"e1566a4a-4788-4189-b6de-21441f4b81a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":125109,"FileName":"fb1da0e9-da03-4143-8a76-8ac7f22e71d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4903,"Name":"Karateka","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game begins with an impressive graphic of the fortress of the evil Akuma.

AtariAge user Mitch recently acquired the only known prototype of this game to exist and has graciously shared the binary with the community so everyone may enjoy it. Missing in Action is based on the 1984 movie of the same name, featuring Chuck Norris as the protagonist. The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, taking place in Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War. As Colonel James Braddock, a captured POW, your mission is to escape from an internment camp, rescue captured POWs, free the American embassy, and kill the evil drug czar. Had it been completed, Missing in Action would have been an impressive addition to the 7800 library. As it stands, this prototype is about 85% complete and is quite playable.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l17lcC_ih0g","Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Sculptured Software","Publisher":"TNT Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"d886b3c3-f6a0-4f6c-86e8-58b404e6ddf4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"5138c3f2-7347-4b9b-a8ca-04d7959bec06.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"63c5d676-754d-4c78-874b-3e77e2753ed5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"bfc1a285-aac0-43b4-bc29-984059ee931a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"8306caec-8351-407e-a469-dd23c2793397.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"1a6885a0-ddd0-4cd2-81bc-378171495833.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"2d8fc9e8-7bd6-41d4-b328-f8f499810c3b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"b38563a2-1ff3-471b-ac58-44d722ced331.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"84d0735b-4dc7-4a9c-b7d4-20058602f50f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"74e3c8db-95da-4510-837d-1e810e6198e6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"feb88e49-6af3-4f2d-b120-affd55bd3475.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"8e8dd8cb-bc46-49ee-a715-571a5a604d3a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22378,"FileName":"927cdbe2-107d-4055-8c7b-6c1cac60eda6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125115,"Name":"Moon Cresta","ReleaseYear":"2011","Overview":"The classic arcade game Moon Cresta has now made its way to the Atari 7800!\n\n\n\nEach round consists of ten waves of aliens, and two sets of docking sequences (provided you have a ship left to dock with).

The source code for Plutos was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\n\nPlutos is a vertically oriented space shooter that features gameplay similar to Raiden. The game features six different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Only three of these levels are unique graphically--the other three are just color palette changes. Plutos offers one player as well as two player simultaneous modes, selectable with the left difficulty switch. Plutos also has features a unique weapons power-up system. There are three different types of weapons, each of which can be upgraded up to four times, as well as an invincibility power-up. The three different weapons are: Dual machine guns, spread gun, and energy gun.\n\nA partially compiled version of Plutos was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware.

Your goal in the arcade version of the game is to build up a castle using pieces to form a wall around your territory. After your castle is built, you then place cannons and use them to fire at enemy ships or another player's castle. After each round you then have an opportunity to rebuild your castle before the next round begins.\n\nUnfortunately, the 7800 port of Rampart that is currently available is in an early state and not complete in terms of gameplay or graphics, which is immediately obvious by the lack of a proper title screen. Rampart requires a two-button 7800 joystick. You can select difficulty and number of players, including one player, two players, team or competition modes. Gameplay consists of shooting the enemy targets, which appear as \"NME\" graphics. The left joystick button fires your normal weapon. The right fire button will destroy all enemies onscreen. If you choose a two player game (team or competition), both players can shoot at enemy targets. There are several different playfield backgrounds depending on the game type selected, or if you play additional games.\n\nA partially compiled version of Rampart was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware.

There is a glitch in the emulation right now with the rendering of your view outside the cockpit, but we expect this will be fixed in an upcoming release of MESS.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"e32e77ac-7ade-4d56-80ae-386f24a79642.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"aaa2c302-f272-4e32-9579-5698fc2908ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"44d91cbd-26d4-4d15-98ab-ce0085949c74.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"9aff4e72-e2b5-4aad-9b22-f9063660a17e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"377145d1-0f12-4e2c-9ccf-1c8a60963e38.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"4f9e06d9-f9d7-491e-8b29-286dcc8dc1c4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"231365c7-b8fe-4f68-b630-5575e52ba8d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"510632a2-3dc4-41a9-ab41-a8ba42ad2e0d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"c2923c77-274a-49ab-bf9b-facf0c5d4b85.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22385,"FileName":"1d7cf48f-3b1f-4bf8-83af-0c8ece2440bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125124,"Name":"Rip-Off","ReleaseYear":"2012","Overview":"Rip-Off is a top-down vector shoot 'em up arcade game released by Cinematronics in 1980 and brought to the Atari 7800 by Robert DeCrescenzo.

Sirius' existence has been known for some time, as a physical prototype has been in hands of a collector for years, but this prototype was known to be unstable and crash frequently. The source code for Sirius was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\n\nSirius is a horizontally oriented space shooter that will feel right at home to those familiar with games such as Gradius and R-Type. The game consists of four different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Sirius deftly demonstrates what the 7800 hardware is capable of and compares favorably with NES and Sega Master System games of the time. Unfortunately, Sirius is aggravatingly difficult and will require much practice and patience to succeed through all four levels.\n\nSirius is a single player game only. The difficulty level (easy and hard) can be selected via the left difficulty switch. Sirius has several different types of weapons power-ups. The first is a \"ghost ship\" that follows you and fires when you fire. Other power-ups include rapid fire guns and rapid fire plus spread fire. You can pick up one extra of each power-up type for reserve so that when you are killed you won't be quite so vulnerable. There are also diamonds that you can pick up but they don't seem to do much other than reward you 300 points.\n\nA partially compiled version of Sirius was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Sirius was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Tynesoft","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"31b95cad-f2de-4e47-b00f-40df4e18313e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"7bd3285f-1b9c-4fa4-b40e-23bd15fab34e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"9e32065c-c406-4a98-9fbb-e9d9d30dec03.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"50a77e38-1e3c-4c45-b7f8-bdee259b49b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"3b7a466d-52b8-4c92-9792-990bfbd1fac6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"1fc36fbd-0d59-4628-b2da-15bea8c326cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"ecebf1a5-8aed-4689-a152-e854761ba7cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"4ecb51c7-2f8d-484d-9c84-4c95962e22ad.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"b1332947-8191-4c17-8e71-4aa187b8d603.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"60d11a2b-860f-40b2-88ac-c98b85c78e50.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"37841ba4-39fe-45b1-bda8-bc4394b89e23.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22387,"FileName":"2d9d3baa-e80e-41df-8b62-0bfc6b157ca5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":159949,"Name":"Snow Day","ReleaseYear":"2009","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Pachamplus","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"ecd6cb32-7ecf-4cdd-bf22-a645d83014a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"1657b620-c3d2-478e-83a4-2e2b7a7e075d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"ff798bbe-f751-4db3-a8be-b3e001831a54.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"dccdbe1a-a562-4e38-84ec-6ac5ecea6790.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"45c72b81-0e39-4847-8a66-a1a7020d6899.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"2b528e4b-cf1c-499d-bd27-4325b8664245.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":159949,"FileName":"8118c28a-ab3b-40c5-9060-856a3034151e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":159949,"AlternateName":"Snowday","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":133201,"Name":"Space Duel","ReleaseYear":"2007","Overview":"Space Duel is a port to the Atari 7800 of the third generation of Asteroids-style shooters from Atari, following on the heels of Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe.

In addition, there is a bonus round where players can earn extra points. Like many great games, Space Duel is easy to learn, but takes time and practice to master. \n\nSpace Duel features several two-player variations including Competition Space Duel where you compete against another player for points (and your shots destroy the other player!), and Team Space Duel where you and another player share reserve ships and don't need to worry about friendly fire. Space Duel comes to life on the Atari 7800 thanks to the efforts of Robert DeCrescenzo, who extensively modified the original version of Asteroids to add all the unique Space Duel gameplay elements, graphics and sounds!","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Bob DeCrescenzo","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133201,"FileName":"53e40de3-2b42-46eb-91fc-fb459bd85db8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133201,"FileName":"aea82f46-2310-4958-a97f-bff900adf4c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133201,"FileName":"b0a5833e-5cc5-4c1d-9e4a-ab4cded3ac90.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133201,"FileName":"0139bbc7-56bd-41ca-a5c2-bbfedd7a7c84.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133201,"FileName":"9c865d3b-2cf8-40aa-8d60-f9412d933336.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133201,"FileName":"13f510a2-5d4c-426a-a4ba-60e383a433b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28406,"Name":"Space Invaders","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens.
