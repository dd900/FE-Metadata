He must follow the instructions written on the card. If he is instructed to a previous clue position, he returns to that position, and play continues, with the DETECTIVE relighting the clues in the same sequence as before.

It works with game card #4 originally supplied with the system.\n\nEach player picks 2 word cards, 2 number cards, and 1 image card. They then take turns at the console in trying to put the invisible player spot on any letter, number, or shape they need to complete the contents of their cards. Pushing the reset button makes the spot appear on the screen. Lighting a wrong symbol might give other players an advantage if they can use it for their own cards. The first player to gather all elements he has on his cards wins.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lsqvmIKlxA","Platform":"Magnavox Odyssey","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Magnavox","Publisher":"Magnavox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138441,"FileName":"62323b47-3309-44e2-b4ee-2cf53ae9b6f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138441,"FileName":"66fe7aa5-ceb5-4fed-8681-f224b3a2f230.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138441,"FileName":"565d146e-92c5-4024-b9ff-c9d45261ebd8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138441,"FileName":"53d95e28-e3f9-4401-a355-30500d3fb956.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138441,"FileName":"3faef8ed-c26c-4be7-8a02-d492f5b519e4.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138441,"FileName":"dcbb4d86-c9ce-46e6-b6a2-2d94bff11150.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138431,"Name":"Wipeout","ReleaseYear":"1972","Overview":"A racing game using both a track overlay and a game board; the game board keeps track of laps and the second player's dot along with the ball dot keeps time.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss9xf5Lb6yU","Platform":"Magnavox Odyssey","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Magnavox","Publisher":"Magnavox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138431,"FileName":"eb1ad97b-4635-471c-8321-60b9cd60c5c5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138431,"FileName":"2288aeeb-927a-4aaa-b14b-13f8e5b4a0c8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138431,"FileName":"073b99b4-a990-4ad1-bc8b-f7d7683257ee.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138431,"FileName":"cd07251c-0e25-417f-9e49-c26a60c8d284.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138431,"FileName":"cb17f566-8c07-443c-8860-dd036db8caa8.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138431,"FileName":"bde2138c-e887-4491-b190-409bedea6dd4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
