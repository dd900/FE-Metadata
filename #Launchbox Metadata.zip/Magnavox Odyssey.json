At all times, the players must avoid the top or bottom of the screen (otherwise, it's called \"ball off the table\").\n\nThere's no score keeping on screen, so the players must keep score by themselves. The first player to get 21 points wins the match if he has at least a 2 point margin.

The fantasy world is represented as a number of countries on the included game board, and players try to conquer their opponents' castles. The console is used to battle out attack and defense.\n\nA player can either choose to sneak into the castle by trying to blindly move her player spot to the gates, or attack directly by maneuvering the game ball around the defensive player. Once inside the castle, she has to try to destroy the tower defense by estimating where the ball spot will land on the screen.","Publisher":"Magnavox","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1972,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lCNRnqj328I","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnavox_Odyssey#Games"},"138431":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Magnavox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"eb1ad97b-4635-471c-8321-60b9cd60c5c5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2288aeeb-927a-4aaa-b14b-13f8e5b4a0c8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"073b99b4-a990-4ad1-bc8b-f7d7683257ee.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cd07251c-0e25-417f-9e49-c26a60c8d284.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cb17f566-8c07-443c-8860-dd036db8caa8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bde2138c-e887-4491-b190-409bedea6dd4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wipeout","Overview":"A racing game using both a track overlay and a game board; the game board keeps track of laps and the second player's dot along with the ball dot keeps time.","Publisher":"Magnavox","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1972,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ss9xf5Lb6yU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnavox_Odyssey#Games"},"138432":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Magnavox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1db09cf2-bf52-4e4b-9a5b-0c8d93e6e899.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c480fbe2-129b-41ab-8a47-b42380302439.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f197eac8-5084-4f08-9d36-0c2c57dbab04.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a98ebc02-5691-4fd0-9f40-11ff7d0ca4c9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7fd5ebe9-97e2-4cf6-8451-0607472f972e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5105d9d0-9539-4def-9ece-569dd42137db.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Volleyball","Overview":"Two players use paddles to knock a ball back and forth on a screen; uses an overlay of a volleyball court, and players must knock the ball over the net for scores to count.","Publisher":"Magnavox","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1972,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zjriBzcZaeU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnavox_Odyssey#Games"},"138433":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Magnavox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"6df736b4-002e-455c-8a04-cc5807724d7b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5eb273ec-0e9c-424f-bf97-4b103860d1a0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30f89215-a2b3-45ac-94c6-e8b187384677.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d2f5dfbb-73d7-4900-849b-15c2038e7b2b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a1de6a9f-1ab6-4ee2-9fc1-613bd9ad4c54.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dd871d10-4077-4bc6-87a0-b463f34eed72.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Soccer","Overview":"Two players use paddles to knock a ball back and forth on a screen; uses an overlay of a soccer court and players score only if the ball reaches the opponent's goal on the overlay.","Publisher":"Magnavox","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1972,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YobdRHQz3zI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnavox_Odyssey#Games"},"138434":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Magnavox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c2e7247d-9c26-46b7-aac1-d937cae68f2c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a170757-a815-4601-a503-8874fa55180a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"317d073a-a9e3-402a-a9af-b69745d6fa8c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e670fd39-f4be-4e84-b7fe-a38358c82797.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ebc8d48a-12eb-4994-b2b0-65247af1293e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49ce0dd2-e77a-404e-90cd-ac6497ae2aa7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Handball","Overview":"Move the ball left or right then toss it..
