The warriors' powers threaten to utterly destroy the fabric of the MK universe. Upon this scene, the Elder Gods demanded a safeguard to be put in place to absorb the kombatants' insatiable bloodlust. In an enormous crater in Edenia, these warriors clashed in a single battle royale between the Forces of Light and Darkness that would threaten to rip apart reality and bring about the Apocalypse. Without warning, a mysterious pyramid rises from the ground, and the tip bursts into flames, attracting the warriors' curiosity to see what it was. The kombatants fought one another to get to the top, while Blaze, the gods' firespawn revealed himself to them. The firespawn was created by Delia, a powerful Edenian sorceress, and the mother of the main character in \"Konquest\" mode to destroy each fighter that would threaten him in order to save the realms from Armageddon. This would be the warriors' last battle, their last chance to prove that they are worthy of surviving, while many others will die.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-09T00:00:00-07:00"},"4567":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"24100f8e-b2fe-45c8-8bbe-1bae6252da6f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1e417e3c-7d46-4c6a-97d6-87e3d83959b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0699d561-641b-4995-b52a-1fa45d772dc2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7db4a8e1-7b5e-4ec5-b5be-4ad0be1ac5e0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2f7ea1b6-8486-4063-8605-87ebaeeb2124.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"24cf6639-6f8a-4e05-9ccb-c7ce1d84acea.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"922a7bb3-b756-417d-939c-1c58ead03545.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ee0e88bb-6d34-4771-8655-2c23aa2d4161.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"73da1ccf-5fe2-446d-9783-f36f4af5be21.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c1ba4f84-24cb-447d-a7e4-8d7750e9b85f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cf3ac34e-145e-442a-8f0f-4f15eb7d2398.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"eeef1849-fadb-4092-bd90-4335edd46bba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Far Cry Instincts","Overview":"The game follows the story of a man named Jack Carver.

He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb.\n\nIn most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences.\n\nThe player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Bond_007:_From_Russia_with_Love"},"5918":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eurocom","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2e304078-d82a-424e-b43b-d992dcab40d6.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"06c50d68-2ea3-4052-9c9d-550a6cbbbae5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ad3c3299-9209-4c60-b03c-d5efe345596e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9461edc6-9f58-4bc3-82d1-b107059bbf5d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"508acc92-a07b-4ed8-b4f6-7945db3c8cdf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07d4e7cb-5349-4cf4-89d7-2aaff0843dbb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"8d228708-85fc-4551-9bb7-a9f2e1471d4e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3f420563-ace8-4d55-a56a-eff3c0408f2d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c2309971-4140-48ee-8ed9-98fabd48807c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"48308ce5-fb6d-4666-a01e-8d453319ef05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"007: Nightfire","Overview":"NightFire will feature an original single player storyline -- written exclusively for the game and borrowing from the rich 007-legacy that spans 40 years.

The setting takes place in a universe where planets have banded together to shape future policy and promote goodwill throughout the galaxy. It is a universe where members of an intergalactic council have appointed the Seekers as overseers in the development of new civilizations before these planets are permitted to join the esteemed council. Yet the Seekers are not as diplomatic as they seem. Another species has learned of a sinister plot by the Seekers to eliminate the human race.\n \n\nA small band of human freedom fighters, led by a man named Gideon Wyeth, plans to stop this form of genocide at all costs. Players assume the role of Gideon while exploring the 3D worlds from a third-person perspective. Advent Rising offers a variety of weapons with which to thwart the armies of Seekers, and players will also be able to commandeer vehicles and channel special mind powers for protection as well as offense. The first of a planned trilogy of titles, Advent Rising uses Epic Games' Unreal technology to create the worlds in which players must battle. Orson Scott Card has also written a companion novel to expand upon the ideas found in the game, which can be purchased at the time of Advent Rising's release.","Publisher":"Majesco","ReleaseDate":"2005-05-31T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BKQu4IZDG0I"},"5938":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Terminal Reality","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"98a8c889-c939-4f2a-b4c6-6ce2b60c4c6a.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"68db25b0-129f-4c78-a601-f09a5378f9f5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"72fc0e3a-95c4-43cd-a6e4-d0f34b326b3f.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8a5fee4-50db-4993-b818-6bc1e28fcc56.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"721239bd-2191-413d-bc09-80da92fbfe01.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c13c0904-0478-4ea6-8a83-d66ce060b5ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"df23cceb-4467-48e2-94b9-cc5b49ce85d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c856336b-221e-4aee-bcd8-b8951d85e7c8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e9e84847-a9a1-4c3a-a6a5-34929f5adb95.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"338c20b1-b7d6-43b6-8d78-0f8c5b1a3eac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Aeon Flux","Overview":"Aeon Flux is a sci-fi action game based on the movie that is based on the MTV series of the same name.

The mysterious disappearance of the Onyx Tower and death of Eldrith the Betrayer had left the noble heroes trapped in an unknown setting. Yet the harbor town of Baldur's Gate is still very much part of a heinous plot to control the Forgotten Realms. Five new character types vow to stop whoever or whatever is behind this new alliance, no matter what the cost. \n\nUsing the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rules set, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II features four new acts of hack-and-slash combat and powerful spell casting. Even more monster types will engage in real-time battles using the same overhead perspective as witnessed in the original game. Each selected character can parlay the experience gained from combat into acquiring new feats and enhanced abilities over time. To help in battle, a new item creation system lets players craft magical weapons and armor using raw materials found during their travels.\n\nAs before, two heroes can join the adventure in cooperative play on the same screen, with each character differing in the types of feats and powers under his or her command. Equipment can be found or purchased from local merchants using the gold looted from felled creatures or received as payment for quests. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II also features a number of hidden areas, secret characters, and literally hundreds of items to find and use, including potions, scrolls, and wands. In addition, the game features a new branching storyline that offers players a choice where to go next for fortune and honor.","Publisher":"Interplay Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2004-01-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Dark_Alliance_II"},"5980":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eurocom","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2b5e4bef-491f-455c-ac7d-289df819a67b.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4345b92d-48c3-46d8-8c02-891f19710843.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2ffadc02-59b9-4789-bdfa-4915c19a1f22.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"34ce4490-e6f9-4141-a628-31e7ae920788.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"20952d57-a99b-46dd-90e3-726b5e2d60e5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e672bdc4-7581-4b69-9a4e-bdf0ae651cd0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dca02c2e-5185-430e-a3ae-d63713e057d3.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a42ddb7c-c03c-4784-acff-db47ac58a029.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"866ea7d9-e343-410e-875c-04fb33b2f25a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a38db62b-6400-420b-a4da-6bb993d10ac8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8e5944a9-c8d8-4553-a0eb-fc6c7a8bd0c3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e40275d1-a173-4a07-836c-5ab5f303ef03.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b46ee944-9498-4db1-9c90-96b6b0547b60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b48d80c9-3dd0-4c40-bd77-5432b1a7f21b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Batman Begins","Overview":"In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored.

Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.\n\nMissions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica's war room. Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.\n\nPlayers control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full. Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.\n\nMissiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu. Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius.

It shows a man and woman running down a street. The woman trips, and the man pauses long enough to help her up, only to be dragged into a dark alleyway by a chain. His head is thrown from an alley at the woman's feet, with Rayne walking calmly up to the woman. The woman seemingly breaks down crying, but in fact only hides her face to reveal she is in fact a vampire. After a brief fight, Rayne decapitates her and then takes off before a small army of vampires tries to catch her off guard. She drops a grenade on their position as she leaves.\n\nOn top of the buildings, two mysterious men, who were watching the events unfold the whole time, are discussing their reason for being here. One reveals they are here to recruit Rayne, who is trying to find where her father is. The other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave a necklace with their symbol on it (as seen on the game cover).","Publisher":"Majesco","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pmQ-8e5xI7g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BloodRayne"},"5998":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Terminal Reality","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"579878b1-d594-44dc-a002-81f74ffb7d14.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b210d425-bc49-494f-804c-9c3b1776661b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9b7a3bad-93bc-42be-82e6-a5374c23442e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2c3c07d0-988e-4cd4-8373-f0d7619caaf4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7ef4eb5-5356-46c1-8d90-96de5c459af2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3c33fee7-2cdd-4fdb-aa44-93f3c6a2adbf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6f1cc9b1-4e82-4cf7-9a61-5bdc4f91721c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b8bef3d7-8e95-418a-9aa0-07fd1888b121.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5d36ceb0-02b7-42bf-8d01-4ef7dc76c046.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"23de20c3-424a-4cfa-8fd7-2f22c5e60ad3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"df285f5c-ba57-4266-b81f-8a63aa422267.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c1f348eb-4c62-4ad1-9b6f-b2f9003945fc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7abd1f0c-c3f5-4eed-a59f-ef87cc9c7778.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8c850c85-db6a-4924-b411-d5da0fd6ee2a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6d41670c-84cf-4562-b0a7-5fe15cfb8162.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"da074457-a3bc-46b2-83b0-1acdefe5f290.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9e6bff91-a14b-42a7-8915-f343b1a81dbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"de4a4b16-dd1b-4b0d-8621-da02931f0088.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BloodRayne 2","Overview":"BloodRayne 2 is an action hack and slash video game and the second game in the BloodRayne series.

The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version.

Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughout the county's streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks, and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dm0GPII9EJM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burnout_2:_Point_of_Impact"},"6011":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Criterion Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"41be164f-866f-43c9-a784-d59e00d065f5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"578af54d-a7c4-40af-9cf7-fcc59b7c81b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"81717dcb-dbcf-452a-be2e-6fbc20d6ee35.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"51ec41ff-0ca8-4214-b612-a0f8863e0664.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3c88bd6d-804d-40ca-8846-f6493e562cf3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92b1c2fe-3f87-450e-9bda-2695931cf185.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"22da5126-54ff-4746-af41-b526da9d6169.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a2138e79-520c-4af5-b0a2-4f552d0ad447.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a512152d-d309-42b4-bd41-a4f69d3bf534.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6f7a661d-a87c-436a-a6c5-3c81706bf217.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"86a24fd6-657c-458d-b925-c8e874d16014.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df16e327-387b-4633-9994-e1adb74cf9b0.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"86396a9c-a2c0-40b0-92c7-5edf7e9d587e.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9bc44571-222c-40c6-a123-de73c9896086.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":6,"Name":"Burnout 3: Takedown","Overview":"Burnout 3: Takedown is a racing video game with arcade-style gameplay that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which take place on city streets populated with traffic. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, can be used to rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown, a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a colored arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to maneuver the wrecked car into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p4bSWqgeRUE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burnout_3:_Takedown"},"6012":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Criterion Games","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"7f1ac648-9756-4c67-83da-011421eb729e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4bc3c7f5-2601-4598-8125-eb2585f6b6d9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"354b8e9a-727c-4990-8c10-df9021f71f56.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d4e8fbe6-660e-48f6-9e0c-742769a034c3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"66d3cbed-8d52-47dd-ab8b-0bcc627ec304.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"34f4397e-089d-44ed-8fdd-adac6f1a1608.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8289e5df-6cfa-4b87-87d4-8f489cca2886.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"dfa8f56b-7b8b-4cde-8bcb-f12769538773.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d494c419-2873-4235-bb56-01423541cefd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"082c1cf9-2320-4b38-9568-ed55c158bc60.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6e280399-f143-4f76-96f6-2177618d0477.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Burnout Revenge","Overview":"Burnout Revenge is a racing game in which your desire for destruction is as important as your ability to reach the finish line.

However, this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess, accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him.\n\nA self-proclaimed \"quest for coin and cleavage\", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series. As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can heal the hero.\n\nDuring conversations the player can choose \"nice\" or \"snarky\" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.","Publisher":"1C Company","ReleaseDate":"2004-10-26T00:00:00-07:00"},"6014":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fun Labs","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"8d74a9bf-0d75-46e2-acac-0db4339b5ebf.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"74d7c191-d062-4e34-bc9a-867337d3c81b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8a69f97a-6b47-40ee-b98f-cb02782b28cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"067161fc-7ee1-4a50-a9bc-0853d821d826.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c5721425-dad1-4a07-ac1f-74144acf4d29.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8c306b18-fdb5-4401-a36c-3b5eca1d81f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cabela's Dangerous Hunts","Overview":"Cabela's Dangerous Hunts is a hunting game with adrenaline - hunt or be hunted!\n\nMany of the animals you'll be after are dangerous and aggressive and will take you one-on-one - and you'll be armed with a primary weapon as well as a knife or pistol for close combat defense.

It can be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment.\n\nThere are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.\n\nThe RPG aspect includes the initial character specialization, and between missions levels the player get skill points, which can be saved for later or allocated between missions to improve various combat skills:Hand-to-Hand, Pistol, SMG, Rifle, Heavy SMG, Stealth, Medic, Grenade and 'Combat Sense'.\n\nIn single-player has classic run-and-gun gameplay. You use a player-centered bird's-eye view, and you must turn the character to spin the view as you can only shoot at enemies at the top of the screen, as opposed to the sniper mode, when you use a 1st person scoped view. The screen has a fixed scaling, there is no zoom or free pan, other than to automatically give you a few seconds look ahead when key locations are nearby. The player is kept in the center of the screen and the view window automatically slides over the battlefield as your character moves. Normally, enemies won't fire until they are within your view - but there are exceptions.\n\nIn two-player coop mode, each player can shoot in the direction their character is facing, and do not need to rotate the view to hit the enemy. The players cannot be farther apart than the screen size, which is fixed. The screen is centered between the player characters in this mode. If players are far apart at opposite edges of the screen, they can often be shot at from off-screen enemies, as enemies are triggered by being close enough - about half the screen size away on the map, no matter if you can see them yourself.","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-21T00:00:00-08:00"},"6027":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Conflict: Global Storm"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pivotal Games Ltd.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c4d95d36-7b84-42d0-b0f1-d503d3d9221f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b3c1a110-dd0e-477b-962a-8eb3ac9a1a97.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5d2ee186-c51c-40b1-901f-5350d1f11791.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"497dbda0-0bf4-4110-bebd-72fc3814484a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ac97ae0b-b608-456e-808f-ed5d3fc9b424.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9f43a05b-88b9-4e69-9ac4-22c9447201c6.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"13762261-e387-462a-af6d-178f805b4429.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Conflict: Global Terror","Overview":"Conflict: Global Terror (also called Conflict: Global Storm) is the fourth game in the Conflict series and was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows.

After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, after being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions. The game begins in Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho attempting to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game, and in doing so releases Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him the curse of the vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Cassidy as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse. As the game progresses, Jericho finally makes his way to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch initiation exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him. When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to use their powers and walk in sunlight.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2005-08-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5YPJzwKXx_w","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Darkwatch"},"6039":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Dancing Stage Unleashed","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"4be132e5-71c6-4862-823d-d728aaca5709.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"da0be84a-4965-4677-b0e7-594f64c35177.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ff1e11ec-3562-48ff-ab76-5ce2e47efb83.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7cb37462-05b5-4387-82b3-99cc71473724.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6a28e551-36c4-4b4b-9a00-be3a4f4c89d2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e3b77b9-6aaa-441e-a68a-5e7638aaafb0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f5936ed-958a-462d-a4f7-b515b7c0bf36.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e3d792ff-aa54-4153-92d2-ad8986ab7032.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8fe9cec1-e1a3-43f7-a678-d52b4fff7cc4.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ebf71209-85f5-478f-8e99-3a533cf1e56e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Dance Dance Revolution: Ultramix","Overview":"On November 18, 2004 Konami Digital Entertainment of America released Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 on the Xbox in the United States.

Doom 3 was first released for Microsoft Windows on August 3, 2004.[6] The game was later adapted for Linux, as well as being ported by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X. Developer Vicarious Visions ported the game to the Xbox console (now backwards compatible to the Xbox 360), releasing it on April 3, 2005. British developers Splash Damage also assisted in design for the multiplayer elements of the game.[7]\n\nThe game is a reboot of the Doom franchise, disregarding storylines of the previous Doom video games, it is however a prequel to Doom I and II (according to the Doom RPG website they are all part of the same universe, it places Doom RPG as a sequel to Doom 3, and prequel to Doom\/Doom II all starring the same marine character[8]). Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to research into fields such as teleportation, biological research and advanced weapons design. However, the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons. The player, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base and find a way to stop the demons attacking Earth.[9] Doom 3 features an award-winning game engine, id Tech 4, which has since been licensed out to other developers,[10] and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.\n\nThe game was a critical and commercial success for id Software; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, it is the most successful game by the developer to date.[10][11] Critics praised the game's graphics and presentation,[12] although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original Doom, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters.[13] The game was followed by Resurrection of Evil, an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software in April 2005, while a Doom film loosely based on the series was released in October 2005. A series of novelizations of Doom 3, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008.[14] An expanded and improved BFG Edition was released in the fourth quarter of 201","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doom_3"},"6051":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"id Software","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"768d661e-f791-4db1-98d8-88b09ca58d86.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"92e83d4e-04f9-475e-9a8a-3cd0257c9960.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c9d42123-8aee-48ee-9cb3-effe3472dda6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ae9e817a-e156-405b-b049-5872639839b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0183c1df-5999-469a-9d20-7bbbcfc60d0d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"156369df-6cda-4c30-b4e5-e8559793315e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"787a5a34-cc5c-412a-85e7-beea20d9ea0b.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"39631479-29f1-4da2-a4f7-4b7a72d894e8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8cc81827-f0a2-4a4a-bee8-d938802abddd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5425f26e-960d-4a87-ba08-72f959a70aa4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil","Overview":"Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil (stylized as D00M3 RESURRECTI⊕N ⊕F EVIL) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Nerve Software.

There's also a trick system, if used correctly, can give you a temporary speed boost. Typical kart racing powerups such as speed boosts and rockets can be used to stall or slow down other racers. \n\nThere are two multiplayer modes that can be played up to 4 players on the Xbox system, such as the \"classic\" mode, which is the base single player game and \"Jam\" mode, where players must acquire a CD and hold onto it for a limited time to be declared the winner.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-NLkm697hec"},"6070":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blitz Games","Images":[{"FileName":"3d2b58a1-9153-47f2-89c6-7a8c8fe4c094.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c563824e-fbd8-45b3-8737-5ed242ce4a17.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8a33269e-d975-42cf-b0b2-3c5d34a8598d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b851bd4a-9c43-4164-8385-88de95208578.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43db6a53-aece-4e9f-ad4d-01d021985ccc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f3f3cd47-469a-456b-8f4e-b480487abd77.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f934d915-1a80-4bf2-99f3-ead5c6672068.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b2a72559-f0eb-4d4b-aeb5-877ccb74144a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Fuzion Frenzy","Overview":"Fuzion Frenzy is a launch title for the Microsoft Xbox.

Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.\n\nThis version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.\n\nDefeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.\n\nThe game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.\n\nThe newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"2005-12-12T00:00:00-08:00"},"6072":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom Production Studio 2","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f85ce886-8055-46ad-b7c4-1390fa38639a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3a91fe53-03fa-44fc-891a-ccadcae8b475.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c55a5555-0f1d-4127-88cc-d1917df8b5d3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a08f8b2c-9516-438e-bf03-eb6e5feac442.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6ac09391-df60-44b3-8635-5551a1acd3d8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6488e557-3a5c-462e-9513-dc556cddd66f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d5379785-bf1d-496d-ba53-d48c0a2f3d61.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"671d205a-03be-4fae-ac5a-c1ee010e9a11.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a98cfdcf-f2ba-4609-8932-0d1d4c6a1c28.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b624655b-94b5-4e5f-bd6c-75e11422b71b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Genma Onimusha","Overview":"Onimusha: Warlords, released in Japan as Onimusha (鬼武者?), is the first action-adventure video game of the Onimusha series, released first for the PlayStation 2 in 2001.

The game has also been ported to various other platforms and services, such as OS X and the PlayStation Network.","Publisher":"Rockstar Games","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City"},"6078":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"d8c3e7aa-988e-4622-acf1-8ffb94fb56d7.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0191d5bb-bac3-46b0-bad6-bdbd02c772c4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"99bc6856-f51e-4bd3-8050-9b1551fdac8e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"67bf7c26-3375-4a8a-adc0-4a84601b6a4c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"3aaa5187-8a10-4afc-8e95-e17727e9f399.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c04d2568-dbd7-462e-9d47-30efa2a7ca27.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cd3ed125-4185-4afb-9fca-d9fa1e2933b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Guilty Gear X2 #Reload","Overview":"Guilty Gear XX ♯Reload (ギルティギア イグゼクス シャープリロード, Giruti Gia Iguzekusu Shāpu Rirōdo) is the first update to Guilty Gear XX and the 7th installment of the Guilty Gear series. It features balancing changes along with giving the character Robo-Ky its own moveset, with it being merely a palette-swap of Ky in the original game. The console version adds a fully voiced story mode dictating the events that took place after X as seen through each character's view. It also added Kliff and Justice back in as secret characters.\n\nNo changes to the general gameplay have been done, though there are several balance changes done to the cast, thus reworking the tier lists overall. Among several changes, Robo-Ky, a character deemed to be either overpowered\/underpowered in tournament play, was completely reworked from the ground up to be a entirely different character in gameplay and is thus tournament legal from this game onwards, as well as gaining a new and proper EX Mode (he still acts the same as the original Robo-Ky in the story mode of this game however). The EX versions of the characters were rebalanced as well, though Kliff and Justice in the console version only had minor balances. Another notable touch is the inclusion of \"Shadow\" characters, which are different versions of EX version characters akin to the Gold characters. The difference between #Reload and the original XX is the HUD (for character names in battle, XX uses orange text and bold blue text for some versions, while #Reload uses the bold blue text for all versions of the game). But the biggest change, however, is the brand new burst gauge render. Other notable differences are the special effects for the Roman Cancel and Force Roman Cancel, which had their effects changed from solid and deep-colored to a more faded-light effect similar to an Overdrive activation flash. This change stays in subsequent XX titles. The first version of #Reload was initially known as \"Red Reload\" due to several bugs found in the game, but was later redistributed as \"Blue Reload\" as the bugs were fixed. The game is also compatible with Xbox Live. \nThe game's soundtrack was tweaked when released in Korea. It is a completely different soundtrack with a more darker tone to the music, composed by Shin Hae Chul. It has been said that this alternate soundtrack focuses more on the rhythm rather than the melody (mixed in with techno as well, but the traditional thrash\/metal\/rock is still retained in the tracks).","Publisher":"Majesco","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nlMBbJYiuPk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guilty_Gear_X2_updated_versions#Guilty_Gear_X2_#Reload"},"6079":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Bungie","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"db351687-c00d-410f-8f05-ba1e4eaeff3d.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"cc57029e-d210-46ac-b678-fa62f0afb0d1.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e64e11b1-2193-46ce-9988-24cf9295f028.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5d497a26-81ac-4909-8f04-e3bfd2f95557.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"422cbacf-76d3-49a5-9b45-d888b5f183db.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8c31684-6835-4603-afea-02b4b1f1b1d5.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"751845e6-4109-4571-b463-4dc1501349a1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4b42c113-eb70-4174-ae38-33398b5c9dd1.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6206757e-05e7-4dc5-ac4a-d213e02f2171.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"48240a23-0367-4ed8-bb38-62242fd3f246.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"280f150f-2559-47d1-ad2f-e3e7eb0ccffc.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea79d9b4-6cb4-46dd-951d-d7ef9e9beb1b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"54540e35-d640-465d-8923-814eb1edae10.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"9fcbebc5-8b71-495c-9f84-34db0edb38c8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0979c729-28e5-48b7-897c-4c04b577cb1d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2246c38a-d524-4d21-848e-777025bd0f5b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"be4570c7-554e-4692-af5d-88aa54eb5b09.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dc90f630-cc2e-4d46-b589-780e157fef5a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0ded0465-db69-4e12-a515-e9210b7ec8fc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4917bddf-3c46-473b-a3af-80ad06219747.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e94a6f25-e6e7-418c-a800-7b45c7afdb09.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Halo 2","Overview":"Halo 2 is the sequel to the highly successful and critically acclaimed Halo®: Combat Evolved.

If all are completed, a gold medallion will be given. Missing one or two will gain a silver or bronze. Most missions involve Holt fighting alongside allied NPCs and working towards a common objective, often based on historical events during WWII.

The game follows the fictional story of Ryu Hayabusa, a master ninja, in his quest to recover a stolen sword and avenge the slaughter of his clan.\n\nTecmo specifically targeted Ninja Gaiden at a non-Japanese audience, and despite difficulties in obtaining content ratings due to the game's graphic depictions of violence, it was generally well received, and 362,441 copies were sold in North America in the first month after its release. Nevertheless, the game had to be censored for release in some regions, and Japanese sales were poor, with only 60,000 in the four months following its release. Making use of the Xbox's internet connectivity, Ninja Gaiden was the focus of a series of online contests across North America, Europe and Japan. Record-breaking numbers of players took part, competing for places in the live final, which was held during the Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2004.\n\nTeam Ninja continued to update the game after its release: two Hurricane Packs were made available as free downloadable content that added extra content, gameplay challenges, and game engine improvements.[1] These were incorporated into a reworked version, released in 2005 and entitled Ninja Gaiden Black, that was regarded by the game's creator Tomonobu Itagaki and many players as the definitive version. In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was graphically enhanced on the PlayStation 3, with extra content, in the form of Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

Your turbo\/weapons meter is charged by passing through gates set up on each level. This can be used for turbo boosts of course, but it also controls the weapons.

The area was hit centuries ago by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium \"whispering rock\", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years the asylum had more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands but has fallen into disrepair.","Publisher":"Majesco Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aDbDShqvc_o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychonauts"},"6118":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"DICE (Digital Illusions CE)","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"a8fa574a-819b-4aca-8c10-425a5cfb525b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"161b294f-8ef2-44df-a1c6-dbeacc34df25.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f39b290b-c4d5-41be-8bdb-1b9f703bcd25.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5ac3d688-6eb5-4ad7-aa57-5f9b45c9e1ea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2b311535-98b1-4451-b55f-ce441ba60a61.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"da10e028-2fc0-4404-92e5-2da8ae03bb86.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"84026bbd-4cca-4ccd-8c61-d86b6e051eb4.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fc333533-179a-4a55-910b-3df4167cb844.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"61ae049e-b9f4-4044-a49f-09de2d455028.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2bfe3ef6-d759-4a60-bd40-14c6e8712992.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29a71618-306d-48cd-bc21-337ce47737a1.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e24fff33-0cd4-44c1-bd37-fcdbd57912cc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73f8c7a8-de83-4d64-a332-f69f860814ec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"ab64a32a-3040-45e7-9237-31895ba250a0.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"17105d0a-d731-49f5-aa15-fe6a2a353a03.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1d90abeb-75d5-4b8e-b8ee-d16b143da1f2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"427aa857-c719-4b05-a273-7a744c484b24.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fb77a375-0d59-4a9c-8f8d-a855e475d12d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4d0857ac-b59d-4dd8-ade2-0387f849a1cb.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e362643e-c3d1-4c7c-b95f-6e29919d3f76.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4e7361a5-da1e-49eb-a919-bee871639057.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rallisport Challenge 2","Overview":"RalliSport Challenge 2 is a 2004 rally racing video game, and the sequel to the 2002 RalliSport Challenge.

Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White. \n\nThe missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue \"I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!\" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.\n\nTo do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.","Publisher":"Eidos Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U5sNxv7lVzs"},"6120":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a6f0a4df-b172-4446-ac40-4af09e6fd97f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d5b5d2da-0182-4581-adaf-4dc2e8117dae.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e2d20962-b588-40c3-8740-e6ddd3992ffc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1dfd0533-92e9-4876-ad9d-772e601b4786.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b480689-c26f-4371-a3ee-41589bf1fa19.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73a84bdd-0617-4b2f-9c3d-f130bc04f259.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"369aa3e6-2cdd-4455-8c84-36c337f39b36.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e0ebea42-f14b-4a32-ad86-939ef53d518d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"76048ab5-993a-4ff6-bf7e-abaef6c75597.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War","Overview":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter video game published by Activision and originally released on November 19, 2001 for Microsoft Windows and subsequently for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Linux and Macintosh.

An Xbox 360 version was also being developed, but was cancelled.\n\nThe game is not a direct adaptation of the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, but is instead an unofficial pseudo-sequel which changes the end of the film so that Tony Montana (originally played by Al Pacino) survives, and sets about exacting revenge on those who ousted him from power by re-establishing his drug empire in Miami. The game features Al Pacino's likeness in the character of Montana, but Pacino does not voice the character, as he and the game's producers felt his voice had changed too much since 1983. Instead, Montana is voiced by André Sogliuzzo, who was personally selected by Pacino himself. Actors from the original film who did voice work for the game include Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia and Al Israel.\n\nThe game received mixed to positive reviews, with many critics comparing it favorably to both 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (which itself was influenced by the Scarface film[5]) and 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It was also praised for maintaining the tone of the film, for its humor, and for the accuracy of the depiction of Montana himself.

Players take the role of Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic's Nemesis from Sonic Adventure 2. Shadow must fight his way through many levels to unveil the secrets of his past. Will he choose to join Dr. Eggman or the Black Arms? Or will Shadow decide to fight only for himself and nobody else to discover the true meaning of Shadow's past? The choice is yours and only you can make it.\n\nPlaying as Shadow, you have many new abilities that Sonic does not have. For one, you can use a gun. You also have hover shoes instead of Sonic's plain old running shoes. You can follow whichever path you choose to follow to discover Shadow's true identity. You can collect the Chaos Emeralds or you can help Robotnik or the Black Arms. Depending on what path you choose, you will have a different ending.","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/wr5qZWIs1k8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)"},"6190":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"シェンムーII","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega AM2","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f8f9dd8c-2805-49a0-a946-3ef54d3da653.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"52473b4a-9579-4b98-a8bf-eb04b54b2016.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cbba46ae-16c9-4530-bbfd-9342a2b9e5a7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9b6ab6c5-e19b-4077-9e9a-acddc57992ff.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c2e983f-e91d-4de0-9533-7c7b958cb876.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"ae8788b6-2152-4049-bbf7-4abe8fc44414.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2d9487b9-11f4-4753-b6a1-2c066619647d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0586abab-85eb-42bc-a01c-2a9eca0b4c49.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b17c99b2-5945-4e8f-9a97-2bba643060e8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d9bbbcb4-eff3-4823-affa-3a64b52f70f9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2454c399-97b6-41b9-bc90-f9930882826e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"811c6bab-ec97-490c-a89a-15eecf558257.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shenmue II","Overview":"Yu Suzuki's cinematic masterpiece returns with more spellbinding adventure and an even more immersive world.

It was the first game to include the name \"Sid Meier\" in its title as an effort by MicroProse to attract fans of Meier's earlier games, most of which were combat vehicle simulation video games. The game is a simulation of the life of a pirate, a privateer, or a pirate hunter in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nPirates! is set in the Caribbean. The Pirates! playing field includes the Spanish Main (namely the northern coast of South America), Central America and the Yucatán Peninsula, the entire Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and all Caribbean islands, plus Bermuda. The player is free to sail to any part of the above-mentioned lands, stopped by an invisible barrier southeast of Trinidad, all the way north to just northeast of Bermuda.\n\nThe game was widely ported from the original Commodore 64 version, first to the Apple II (1987), then later to the PC (1987), Apple IIGS (1988), Macintosh (1988), Amstrad CPC (1988), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1990) and Nintendo Entertainment System (1991). The Nintendo Entertainment System port was developed by Rare Ltd. and published by Ultra Games. Notably, tobacco is replaced as a trade item by \"crops\" because of Nintendo's family-friendly requirements.\n\nSeveral different versions were released for the PC: the original 1987 game, which came on a self-booting disk; a 1989 DOS re-release, otherwise identical to the booter version; a 1991 release, which came on high density floppies and only had manual copy protection. The 1994 PC edition, marketed as Pirates! Gold,[1] was a fully modernized CD-ROM game with VGA graphics, and an extra feature where governors assign you missions that were not in earlier versions. Pirates! Gold was also released on the Macintosh, Sega Genesis and Amiga CD32. Finally, an enhanced remake of 2004, also entitled Sid Meier's Pirates!, was released on the PC,[2] Xbox, Xbox 360, Mac OS X,[3] Wii and PlayStation Portable.\n\nMobile versions were also released on the BlackBerry (2010), iPad (2011), iPhone and iPod touch (2012)[4] and Windows Phone 7 (2012).\n\nTommo Inc. purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015.[5]","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-22T00:00:00-08:00"},"6192":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"1afba3e8-d568-46a2-8596-dd64322fb685.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a66f72cd-421d-429c-a961-9f24163ab0ba.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cf670ccf-c70a-4db6-97d3-d935ef63f70d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ef368c0e-9b77-40ca-ac2d-7dcf9d5d0595.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a3a273f4-25e9-48df-84af-8419dd266a4d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56b1fea2-deac-4fea-bf6e-9a0d4e29525a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"ebd19043-057f-4627-9863-194d9fc3807a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9db73fdd-c6d8-4919-8bd7-7224ffa54f83.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e55d8354-dada-4d11-aa3f-09656276ec58.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8d7f1531-5714-45f4-85a2-fabf01ca568d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"af966ac5-5e74-4319-ab4b-60f5c91be5fd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7f09379a-38a7-40e4-93ee-a10b5b7107a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c524cd8e-4a4e-425a-8c09-530aafd978f9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"SoulCalibur II","Overview":"Transcending history and the world, a tale of souls and swords eternally retold. \n\nFour years have passed since the spirit sword, Soulcalibur defeated the evil Soul Edge.

Double Agent was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 in October 2006. The Wii and Microsoft Windows versions were released in November 2006. A PlayStation 3 version was released in March 2007. Originally the game was set for a March 2006 release, but Ubisoft moved the release date to October 2006 in order to have more development time. Ubisoft then released their fiscal quarter results for Q1 2006 and announced that Double Agent would be put back at least one month in order to boost Q3 2006 income.\n\nThere are two separate versions of Double Agent. One version was made by Ubisoft Shanghai, who developed Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and was released on the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 3. The other version was made by Ubisoft Montreal (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory) and was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Nintendo Wii. The Ubisoft Shanghai version features a completely custom engine while the Ubisoft Montreal version plays more like the classic Splinter Cell games. The games share the same general plot but feature different storylines, plot twists, and levels. They do however, share the same background music, a few cut scenes and all voice actors. The version for mobile phones was developed by Gameloft.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"6198":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Pandemic","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"d5f919a6-cde6-4e47-9b9d-5c28ef36bf9d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d0702d71-8cdd-4511-8c69-7e644b9e794a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"29d59692-b975-477f-821b-52d239cd75c2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46250db5-0291-4cb1-a975-62dbf3ca4b9e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b3003a84-a2e5-4d31-b5f6-0a14ca7bce0c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fe0666a8-3c5f-44f7-ba52-233f3ddf8c23.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e3e5878d-08f4-476e-b9d3-733cec68d339.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ec691a38-0c44-405a-ac8d-1da0c5c8f570.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ae694a22-4b54-47f1-92eb-49a888d2dc4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":32,"Name":"Star Wars: Battlefront","Overview":"Star Wars: Battlefront encompasses battles between four main factions from both the original and prequel trilogies: the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy.

Stubbs the Zombie is set in a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one day as he zombifies the entire city.\n\nBefore becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.\n\nLuckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to take control of enemy humans and their weapons.","Publisher":"Aspyr","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bZjk9zgKF4A"},"6210":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Starbreeze Studios","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8e5e1c22-e046-4492-bc85-ccfc97bdbf9f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8b6e8041-6dc3-416e-bbe3-95756be582af.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6eafa124-eff2-4627-a1dd-3aa5f1d59f3f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9cabc49c-79fb-43ca-9121-d49b54d75aa2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"74d2b99f-64f5-4e43-a3d3-858132159270.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d9b2abe4-d10c-4e1c-9c5f-532c5d8284ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9f25fbf2-d76b-4109-9971-98dcfade8e12.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c97cfeae-c432-4683-94e0-b9b08c99bad0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay","Overview":"Escape from Butcher Bay is set in the futuristic science fiction universe of the Chronicles of Riddick franchise, and is a prequel to the film Pitch Black.

In the midst of a brutal terrorist plot, the game follows the actions of the six playable characters; three Special Forces members, a security guard, a secretary, and a cameraman. Set over twelve hours, the feel of the game, storywise, is similar in style to the TV series 24.\n\nWithout Warning was developer Circle Studio's only video game, before the company began focusing on DVD games as opposed to console games. It was also the first game that Capcom published that was developed by a Western company. Despite relatively high expectations during development, given the developers' previous work on the hugely successful Tomb Raider series, upon release, it received generally negative feedback by most game critics and players due to an evidently rushed release. Most complaints centred on the glitchy AI and numerous other technical inadequacies, coupled with a poor storyline and characters.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"6222":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"c1cc6315-91fb-40ef-99aa-89366e07c7de.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"42615740-b98a-4d49-8713-dde1785941d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4c75c397-d0a9-4552-b01e-54623d13f86f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4dff97b5-04c4-4d52-a0ba-a5b8b546ea7d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc4d4521-2c60-411a-b9c3-82caf5fca3fc.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8967f211-8aab-4b2a-ab5f-dc9ef435c306.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"XGRA: Extreme-G Racing Association","Overview":"After the F1 Nurburgring disaster of 2025, the Extreme Gravity Racing Association, or XGRA, was set up as a regulatory governing body for all heavy gravity race events as an equivalent of NASCAR or the FIA.

The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.\n\nLike the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky & Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.\n\nThe overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car.

However, his son, General Choi Song, and the military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world. \n\nEventually, plans of a nuclear reactor construction began to surface. China, South Korea, the Allied Nations and even the Russian Mafia sent troops to North Korea, competing for power in the troubled region. A bounty of a hundred million dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the playfield.\n\nMercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a free-roaming war action and driving game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.\n\nPlayers have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the \"Deck of 52\", a list of most wanted criminals in North Korea, as well as a number of factions. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck. \n\nPlayers have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done. It is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside. Helping out various factions provides access to numerous vehicle drops, supply drops, and air strikes.","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2006-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ik-5I6Mqi78","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mercenaries:_Playground_of_Destruction"},"8016":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Xicat Interactive","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"cf436100-a526-4650-b37a-aef65d92c541.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"09965d38-270e-4060-8e0e-bac0d61047e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9fe5e6a8-fe43-4418-8c27-efab5a213f73.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa9f73a5-64eb-4d59-8317-3c7bd8e50a32.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fa43b218-989c-45ca-becf-062d38ab2ee5.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"29048c49-004f-46f2-af43-523cc30c50fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Metal Dungeon","Overview":"Metal Dungeon (メタルダンジョン?) is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Panther Software for Microsoft's Xbox game system.\n\nThe game takes place in a fictional alternate reality where countries have access to highly advanced magitechnology.

The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters.\n\nGame play[edit]\nAs the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters.

Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one.\n\nFencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy \"Limit Break\" that would damage all enemies at once.\n\nAnalyzer Ranged class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in game model.\n\nCaster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in-game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use.\n\nBroader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding.\n\nStriker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy.\n\nReception[edit]\nMetal Dungeon was rated very poorly for its simple game play, transparent story, and character creation system.

While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan and published by Brøderbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.\n\nAs in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.\n\nThe creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired Jack Wall to develop a musical style different from earlier composer Robyn Miller but still recognizable as a Myst game. The project required millions of US dollars and more than two years to complete.\n\nExile was received well by critics; British newspaper The Daily Telegraph called it the best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Myst '​s slower gameplay did not belong in the fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling more than one million copies within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10 million copies combined. Myst IV: Revelation, the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HD6CpLcobSI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Myst_III:_Exile"},"8026":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0c800232-306c-48b9-adb3-5cfd9c72908f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d56720b5-273e-400a-bb27-6bd10cf2e291.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3ba3eb9c-7a06-4e52-a0ba-6934cab61bcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6e31073-f4e1-42d9-86de-02aa97c945c4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6d28e1b0-3e86-436d-874b-16e23a70dc8e.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8a704cdb-5a15-46a8-a624-de4c7eb79d9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Myst IV: Revelation","Overview":"In Myst IV, you learn the fate of the two brothers from Myst 1 and must search for Yeesha, Atrus' daughter.

Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.\n\nAlternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted.

Created by Wipeout designer Nick Burcombe, the game puts the player in the shoes of 16 different characters, paired off in rivalries, whose stories unfold as tournaments are completed. The game has five different speed limits, which act as the difficulty levels for the game. Points earned after races allow players to upgrade their hovercraft's offensive and defensive capabilities. The game featured a soundtrack by Dutch musician Junkie XL.\n\nWhile featuring 16 different characters, critics generally noted that there was not anything particularly \"likable\" about the characters.\n\nDespite the critical response to Quantum Redshift being positive, garnering 76% at GameRankings, the game sold poorly. As a result, the second game, which was to include multi-play over Xbox Live was cancelled by Microsoft, and Curly Monsters closed shop shortly thereafter. As Curly Monsters said a statement before they closed down \"We were pursuing a number of avenues, and we'd developed some really cool new Xbox technology, but unfortunately we were not able to sign a deal prior to us running out of cash... we've not been able to pay our staff for the last month, and now it's time to (unfortunately) call it quits... I expect you'll see and hear from us in various guises as we spread out amongst other developers.\"\n\nThe biggest selling point of Quantum Redshift was the graphics detail it possessed. Water and glass would show real-time reflections, each of the game worlds were abundant with high-resolution textures, and the camera \"lens\" would be flecked with water droplets after being submerged. Quantum Redshift was rated as one of the most graphically advanced games for the Xbox.","Publisher":"Microsoft","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"8037":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"603d0b84-db77-411c-bc66-14aaefe18ad4.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"43e34eac-a832-43eb-984d-079b2c8ef399.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"dc8e9778-6ef1-491a-88c1-998ee366b9bd.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"346aa451-e37b-4c0e-aeec-361a817b0d57.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"692ba2ad-eaa9-4af0-a576-232c52d39590.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d77339e5-fa4d-40ba-8a6b-71bb315205ac.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"25c2bb58-a283-4f46-804c-ca8fabd658c8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"73def306-f2fd-4298-b8df-df5f1531a589.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0d65910c-4351-4d25-89b7-f4afba65306a.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"12274511-c2e6-476a-ba93-97cf56ee69ea.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43e4544d-1fcd-46d9-9552-c89f3252d1d7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"931a96fe-b185-4891-9634-2c033207c25f.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"af6db61b-c19d-46d4-b5b9-6c130b15842a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dbfa3e29-b7d3-4bc9-b787-b24b7bb610ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bbcc967e-3684-469a-a93e-f15e9dc4cdf8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"66693652-513d-4dc6-b8cf-5f1ef803ac9c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"f422c1d7-1ed2-4c04-9f72-65effce1a382.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"965bbb42-148d-4e3a-bb70-c54f0ffc5562.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9b3c25d6-8e3b-4f44-9294-3d244556b9b3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"35a8bbf8-cf68-4336-b426-0eebb023c0dc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cbe1e408-2024-475e-80f3-bb4f28e41453.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c27e5707-2c5d-45de-ad44-6ef872a2a430.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow","Overview":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield is a 2003 computer game developed and published by Ubisoft.

These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer.\n\nA console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow.

Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red's spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge.\n\nRed Dead Revolver features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne. The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier). Each character has his own signature move: for instance, Red's \"Dead-Eye\" slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid \"fan fire\" takedown, while General Diego's flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego's cannons.\n\nBeating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money). You can spend your cash on unlockable characters (for the multiplayer game), journal entries that offer backstory and character info, or an array of canonical Old West weaponry, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns of many varieties, as well as knives, molotovs, poison and dynamite.\n\nThe game features pistol dueling with certain boss characters, as a mini-game mechanic in which you time your draw to an opportune moment and prepare targets as you raise your gun. There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and\/or AI bots. Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of powerups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold 'Em) that mix some strategy into the action.","Publisher":"Rockstar Games, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2004-05-03T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dU-JqOVh3f0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Red_Dead_Revolver"},"8040":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Interplay","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e4936b8e-22dc-42e3-9385-ab49be45e4f8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ab56569e-b321-4d52-b243-c8cb8ed1ee6d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b6895b02-b216-4219-a9e1-40a30187ae7d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"046cc2fc-c9ce-4542-8a61-3c797d2e2958.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f825c227-f3d7-452f-9c1f-cd92c62332b4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"179b13d6-b28f-4c60-8f20-96bf9ee6cac2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c1f0bd6b-080c-4f14-b503-05d1dd3300e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f1eeb7cd-2852-4f6f-b9c0-74e57ac997dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Run Like Hell: Hunt or Be Hunted","Overview":"Run Like Hell (also known as RLH) is a third-person shooter video game designed by Digital Mayhem and released by Interplay for the PlayStation 2 in late 2002 and for Xbox in early 2003.\n\nRun Like Hell is set on a space station in the distant future.

It was developed by Croteam and was released on October 11, 2005. The game was initially published by 2K Games, a Take-Two Interactive subsidiary. The game was later made available on Steam on January 31, 2012. While the game was originally released only for Windows and the Xbox, an unoffcial Linux version of the game was created and is being handled by Linux Installers for Linux Gamers.\n\nIn the single-player campaign, the player assumes the role of hero Sam \"Serious\" Stone in his adventures against the forces of the extraterrestrial overlord, \"Mental\", who seeks to destroy humanity. Taking place after the events of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, Sam travels through various worlds collecting parts of a medallion in an effort to defeat Mental. He is guided by the Sirian Great Council and receives sporadic aid from the natives of the worlds he visits. The multiplayer mode includes online co-op and deathmatch, the latter having been introduced in a patch. A 4.5\/5.0 was awarded to Serious Sam by Computer Gaming World, though overall the game received moderate praise from the media, earning an average of 75% on Game Rankings.\n\nCroteam simultaneously developed Serious Engine 2, the successor to their previous game engine, Serious Engine, for use in the game, and the engine is capable of many features of other advanced game engines of the time including high dynamic range rendering and light bloom. The engine supports integration with both Xfire and GameSpy Arcade for multiplayer match finding. Serious Sam 2 is the only game so far to use the proprietary engine, though the Serious Engine 2 is available for licensing.","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-11T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0FZq3wE_FFs"},"8046":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fox Interactive","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"c9768536-49ee-4b00-a21a-56774b32f244.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"cdd28af6-7ac3-4c19-9a58-36a31892cade.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"657cca84-e4fc-4367-8f43-5f0c4b0dcbbd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"788a9128-3cd7-430a-95e0-0b819bd5b15e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"91ed1f39-1afb-40aa-aaba-77f4a8ae0f3b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"44293f15-18a6-479e-a25d-a12cc3309d32.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"acfa4b24-a729-4a3e-911c-841994ca055a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8588c1da-527c-4a71-9f68-43c2f978a0ad.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c38282a1-80fe-44bb-b442-cc30dea1e7c1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e3086ee2-9bc4-4d29-b98f-15edd53232ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Simpsons: Road Rage","Overview":"Mr. Burns is up to his greedy ways in Simpsons Road Rage, purchasing Springfield's busses and jacking up the fares.

The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a \"special genre\", called a \"Dramatic\/Innovative RPG\", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"8563":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Reflections Interactive Limited","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"025dc229-b5a8-40cb-9e65-6d270c2aeff7.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1b9f6453-a96f-4f5a-9607-7f1b0aa2178f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8af5d566-556d-4008-98d2-76951c639c3b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4974e81d-bfd2-4be5-b2f1-6e3c75505c12.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b730c950-b103-491f-941f-248ddd4acdb1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"486c5514-04c0-4d0c-ba62-a7a140cf859e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"9a34f3e8-3566-4aa5-8847-8320f29cfca8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"667b6e2a-d895-4699-a0d7-bc4aecaab046.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a866f5c3-33d8-4d85-ae05-b90d264d86a0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"dbf4b001-5a32-4b51-b6fd-b9984980db57.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8821833d-383f-434b-ad14-1218b9e165c2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7a09477c-3730-4aa7-b2d5-4e787f5e58b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Driv3r","Overview":"In the game you take the role of Tanner, the undercover cop from previous Driver games, as he infiltrates a worldwide high-performance car theft ring.\n\nNothing is too dangerous or too risky for Tanner, and you'll be able to hop into any car, truck, or motorcycle and cruise the streets of three re-created cities with over 156 miles of roads, from Miami, Nice, and Istanbul in over 25 storyline missions.

Other elements, most noticeably different fighting styles, incorporated elements from other games as well, such as Street Fighter III, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, and the Samurai Shodown series.\nIn contrast to the original Capcom vs. SNK, characters no longer have a specific \"Ratio.\" Instead the player can select up to three characters in a team and give an amount or ratio (up to four) to each as desired. In console versions of the game, players can also choose a 1-on-1 game or a 3-on-3 game in Arcade Mode with the Ratio System removed.\nUnlike the first game, which was based on The King of Fighters-style two-strength, four button system of punches and kicks, Capcom vs. SNK 2 is based on the three strength, six-button system of punches and kicks, native to the Street Fighter series, and the SNK characters have been tweaked to fit the 6-button style. The overall system is derivative of Street Fighter Alpha. However, a number of different fighting styles called 'Grooves', which mimic other Capcom and SNK games, are included in the engine. These dictate both the character's Super Gauge system, and special techniques, such as dashes, running, and guard cancels, called \"Subsystems.\" There are six in total, each designtated with a letter, along with custom grooves that can be programmed in home versions of the game. Each player designates prior to the match which groove his or her team will use.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2003-02-11T00:00:00-08:00"},"10596":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"1db2d8f8-b790-4a7a-8d1e-4b1261dbd326.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e7e99f02-2709-412a-9cf3-da58232d42f1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"856d37ab-a762-41f4-9329-0f8a6850c161.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"decae0bd-4aa9-47cf-a116-6765cbfa9623.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"4771e69d-f3f3-41bd-b955-a58b3526dfdb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b56c0544-f596-436f-92c2-9595cfcfb9f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"53cfc5cc-3ba1-48d1-b860-2b359e927127.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"ea025608-98a5-472e-8a92-dc576c4368db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"15fc0d99-9ee1-4b62-b85e-6d4401b28cb7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom","Overview":"The gameplay is based on the KOF series (particularly The King of Fighters 2002), with the same four button configuration and many of the same techniques.

One new technique introduced in the game is the Front Grand Step, which allows the player to leap towards the opponent and cancel into a basic attack. The player can perform this technique while guarding from an opponent's attack, which will consume one Power Gauge level.\nThe game uses a different type of Power Gauge known as the Groove Power Gauge System, which has three levels. The Groove gauge fills as the player lands attacks against the opponents or guard attacks. When the gauge fills to Lv. 1 or Lv. 2, the player can perform Super Special Moves, a Guard Cancel Attack or a Guard Cancel Front Step maneuver. When the gauge is full, its reaches MAXIMUM level and a MAX Activation occurs. During MAX Activation, the gauge will change into a timer and the player gains the ability to cancel any of their moves anytime (in addition to Super Special Moves and Guard Cancels). Once the timer runs out, the gauge returns to Lv. 2.\nIn addition to the regular Super Special Move, each character also has an Exceed move which can only be performed once when the player's life is less than half.","Publisher":"Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2004-10-07T00:00:00-07:00"},"10597":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7b87c216-3495-46dd-b4ab-9aa79eb058df.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b91fe30f-8f44-427b-9d1d-e6847e2f435f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15806d4a-78f6-4753-aa14-b6c37c8e4d49.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4e9f58a7-6947-46bc-9562-86d1fbd5ef9d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c7a3ba4e-b9d8-428c-8439-c759cc3b5b89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dead to Rights","Overview":"Meet Jack Slate, a cop framed for murder and facing execution.

The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below. The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail.

Built on the ocean, this park is technology's latest word, and is at the first sight the most fascinating and secure construction of all. However, something goes wrong, and seven people - two boys and five girls - become trapped in the park. The danger increases as they face a mysterious virus that brings them on the verge of death. \n\nThe player controls two different characters: Takeshi Kuranari, a simple, normal Japanese teenager, and a mysterious boy with amnesia, who cannot even remember his name. The relationship between the characters becomes more and more tense as the story develops. Will the young people be able to solve the mystery and escape death?\n\nEver17 is the second game in KID's Infinity series. The game is not connected to Never7: The End of Infinity either by storyline or protagonists, but both games share the same \"dreamy\", semi-futuristic setting, and their stories have a similar style. The gameplay of Ever17 is that of a visual novel: the player reads dialogues and watches scenes, viewing them as one of the two protagonists, occasionally having to make decision as to what to do next and how to answer in a conversation. Those decisions influence the course of the story and lead to different endings"},"13027":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Monster","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"a668e33d-829f-43fb-ac4a-b170e06c62ec.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0b7e512f-1cf2-42b9-b147-9e86d69bf9ce.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7e77b4fa-f28c-4409-a363-35ff50675b39.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea523c26-6598-4f7e-8842-7e88dd950395.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"22f82eb0-df03-4d57-81a6-199c0c8c27cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6c6d035f-17b9-4947-b533-523171985532.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"953aef0d-48d3-44a9-baf9-9a9334700ede.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Test Drive: Eve of Destruction","Overview":"Test Drive: Eve of Destruction blends the best elements of racing and demolition and is packed with 25 different events, including Demo Derby, where the last car standing wins; Gauntlet, where the player climbs behind the wheel of a hearse and tries to finish a set number of laps while the rest of the field attempts to stop them; Trailer Race, a new brand of racing event, where players compete while towing various types of trailers and must finish the race with something resembling a trailer still attached.

This third-person action-adventure takes place 400 years after the events in the first title. Killed at the hands of the Sarafan lord, Kain is resurrected and must now regain his memory as well as his powers before he can mete out his revenge.\n\nAs a vampire, Kain requires sustenance in the form of human blood. An onscreen blood meter (which doubles as Kain's health meter) drains continuously, requiring the antihero to feed on enemies or the hapless denizens populating the towns and villages in order to stay alive. Weaker enemies can be dispatched using his bare claws, while stronger enemies will be more easily defeated with the aid of clubs, axes, and long swords found along the journey. \n\nIn addition to standard attacks, Kain is also capable of performing grab moves and stealth-kills, both of which are highlighted by a short cut-scene showing the gruesome death of his victim. Cinematic cut-scenes also introduce the game's many characters and flesh-out the plot. While Kain's blood meter starts out relatively small, it will gradually increase in size after consuming a victim's \"lore\" energy or by finding energy in special relics strewn about the world.\n\nBlocking during combat increases Kain's rage meter, which upon being filled, allows him to unleash any of his combat-related Dark Gifts: special powers regained at critical junctures in his journey. Charm, for example, allows Kain to possess weak-willed citizens and force them to do his bidding, while Mist makes him invisible when surrounded by fog, allowing Kain to sneak around undetected. As more of these Dark Gifts are acquired, areas previously unreachable become accessible.\n\n400 years have passed since the vampire Kain damned the world in the original Blood Omen, choosing to rule the world in damnation then die for it?s salvation. Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies of zealot soldiers and overcome legions of demons in order to uncover the ominous plot that threatens the land he seeks to conquer.","Publisher":"Eidos Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2003-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j01Eg5LdFic","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blood_Omen_2"},"13776":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Los Sims: Toman la Calle","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maxis Software","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"8e6b81f0-e453-4da1-b528-acde5864970f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"92eb682b-0ed1-45a7-989a-b3fd732fda50.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8df7fc23-429f-43bc-a47a-0ee47b01e9a9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d260e2e-7523-4e6f-9d60-32b7ea1cff08.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"8ac51788-c83f-4f94-9c5e-50973fda1b94.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"181c3b1d-4e8f-4a9b-8f4f-34bcfff974d5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"35f5c956-e588-4e4a-bd6e-bfc95d30a016.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3942ffce-9211-4126-ad43-c6fe3d7be8f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9d7cbcb8-9ef3-4e89-9ffe-f9380b4a4cfb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3310b092-229f-436f-a9d9-ff52f0387c6f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ad1e8448-723e-4ce7-91f9-fdfeb70e6c7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab301fb6-57ed-4249-a1a6-dd1acc7e9968.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Sims: Bustin' Out","Overview":"The Sims Bustin' Out is the second title in The Sims console series and the first The Sims title to not be released on PC.

Your job will be to complete several missions which involve assassinating targets all over the world. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from \"Mass Murderer\" up to the coveted \"Silent Assassin\". If you manage to complete a mission with a \"Silent Assassin\" rating, you receive a reward: a special weapon (such as dual sawed-off shotguns), and you can try playing a previously completed mission using one of the special weapons.","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-20T00:00:00-07:00"},"13879":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"IO Interactive","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"ce7633fc-165a-4bde-a66d-36e3e938e11a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a70265d4-30d8-42e5-ba9d-3dcda24efc92.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f94212a2-2554-4b5d-b89a-64b377fb1ec9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"83396018-874e-43fc-ab84-f43edb44b08f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9ee352e3-8c37-4fca-a07a-913a781a5789.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8316ee01-8c61-4236-89b7-9613f446c63e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"35343ffe-fccb-4c82-8b84-ddf9e50e4d8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hitman: Blood Money","Overview":"Hitman: Blood Money is a stealth video game developed by Danish developer IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive.

The memories feature a woman and the phrase, \"Say my name.\" Controller, under orders from a man named Archer, uses Bishop in a series of combat missions designed to convince two nations or groups known as the North and the West to go to war. Archer plans on war profiteering in the resulting war, in part by selling copies of the technology that controls Bishop. Moments before Bishop launches a warhead equipped with a biological agent, a woman known as \"Duchess\" takes over Bishop, in the process causing a surge that kills Controller. Duchess uses Bishop to attack the base Controller is operating from and eventually restore Bishop's memories. It is revealed that the woman from Bishop's memories was his new wife. She was killed by Archer when Archer captured Bishop. Archer wanted the technology in Bishop for resale. Freed, Bishop makes a final assault on Archer. Afterwards, Archer is killed and Bishop walks away.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-28T00:00:00-08:00"},"14260":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Piratas del Caribe","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Akella","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b897c2a4-4589-4da1-9066-d54976fdff01.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"4086d770-f162-4567-997e-7d0b8bce790f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7a6ed59f-91fe-49fd-8b4a-587102f932d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ff171350-638d-48cb-95be-ecc0bc961dc1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3e75f1de-401b-44a9-9181-b73f40615673.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a912caf1-5797-4b93-b390-ba7236b7165c.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4cf44013-c8bf-4fc9-91f0-e0b0ba43cb23.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6e0b2929-9eb7-4c06-96cf-65cf3bf0d91b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pirates of the Caribbean","Overview":"Pirates of the Caribbean is a 2003 video game for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, developed by Akella and published by Bethesda Softworks.

This edition of the long-running series introduces a few changes and additions, designed to make the challenges of executing on offense feel more realistic than ever before.\n\nThe most obvious changes to this year's edition come in the passing game, which introduces gameplay features based on quarterback-specific attributes. Most notable is the new \"Vision Cone,\" which simulates the QB's field of view with a highlighted cone that fans out in the direction of the current intended receiver.\n\nThe feature is designed to force the player on offense to commit earlier in the play, and to telegraph his passes much more realistically than in earlier versions of Madden, making those improbably easy \"no-look\" completions a thing of the past. The range of the vision cone is based on multiple factors, including the quarterback's \"talent\" attribute rating and the difficulty settings at which the game is being played.\n\nMadden NFL 06 also brings a new \"Precision Passing\" system to the series, which allows quarterbacks some direct control over the accuracy of their passes. By bumping the left analog stick or D-pad in the desired direction as the ball is passed, QBs can aim high, low, in front, or behind their receivers, allowing them to lead the catcher away from coverage or make use of height advantages.\n\nOther features, more familiar to gaming's most popular sports series, are also present in Madden 06, along with new replay camera angles, animations, and other presentational upgrades. There's also an offensive answer to last year's defensive \"hit stick\" mechanic, which allows ball carriers to try to plow through oncoming hits and blocks with a flick of commitment on the analog stick.\n\nAs usual, this edition of Madden is designed to offer a highly customizable game of football, and players who prefer the more forgiving play design of earlier editions can simply turn off the Vision Cone -- or nearly any other element that conflicts with their personal style of play. The game also includes all the teams, stadiums, and players of the real-life NFL (thanks to an exclusive license that takes effect for the first time this year).","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-08T00:00:00-07:00"},"14366":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"4295d3d4-3f70-4d2c-9c81-1b22f7be1442.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cf4fae6b-120f-4621-b525-b928970ca431.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ff8da131-0e36-4a1d-aa60-1f90cd4c2075.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5adc7636-eaa2-4c1a-a948-bc9b2a21f5d4.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ef7e19b7-c3c1-4cb3-ab88-82892662777c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d5d65f9a-1990-405b-a481-b46e9813fd14.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Madden NFL 2005","Overview":"Force the action on defense in MADDEN NFL 2005.

It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on August 31, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and on September 4, 2004 for the GameCube. NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the #29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles.\n\nUnlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NEXTEL Cup Series; the National Series (Busch Series), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus muscle cars. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. Also due to failed negotiations Pocono Raceway is not included. This was the last NASCAR game released for the Nintendo GameCube. The score is composed by David Robidoux.[1","ReleaseDate":"2004-08-31T00:00:00-07:00"},"14584":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"278db5b3-bea9-4658-a21a-b1bb2f5f2b3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf: Limited Edition","Overview":"This limited edition contains:\nMechAssault 2: Lone Wolf\nTwo new multiplayer maps that are playable on Xbox Live and System Link\nA behind-the-scenes video by 64TechTV that includes interviews with the creators.\nThe extras come on a separate bonus disc.","ReleaseDate":"2004-12-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14585":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"198591a8-06e9-4bb4-971b-0b6de8323f2b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"69a57e37-a4dd-4963-8e1d-0862dfd58243.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f025e597-46a9-41f1-a3de-0274fcdfd6c4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a9ed9340-5734-4c32-a89a-b097a80c1733.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9679157f-896d-4280-a2c9-7b1ce39b1f53.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"de441cd4-8bd8-4367-bc56-d73b80bbd0cb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0468331c-4b3d-4e86-89f9-c264fe6a926b.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8d5f353b-ed75-41d9-a361-fc73ee6a1d7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"22048490-8808-4b9f-8848-9aec65d4cef7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005","Overview":"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 is a 2004 golf video game in the PGA Tour series available for PS2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC It was later produced and released for mobile phones, Mac OS X, Nintendo DS, and PSP (the latter two as Tiger Woods PGA Tour).

Playboy: The Mansion is a social strategy game that calls on players to build a virtual empire of wealth, celebrity, and freedom from puritanical repression and intolerance. This is accomplished by developing a fully functioning Playboy mansion, to attract and accommodate influential celebrities and beautiful young models who are willing to strike the right poses. Players who can build a suitably entertaining and well-equipped mansion, while adhering to \"the Playboy philosophy,\" are rewarded with \"the Playboy lifestyle,\" surrounded by powerful trendsetters, influential pop idols, and sexually liberated young women. In short, the game invites players to take the role of a virtual Hugh Hefner. \n\nAs Hef, players will be responsible for keeping the Playboy brand relevant to its ever-evolving audience. One good way to do this is by attracting celebrity friends to the mansion, and making sure they have a good time when they visit. With enough money, players can build new facilities -- like swimming pools, movie theaters, or tennis courts -- which may have special appeal to particular celebrities. It's also a good idea to introduce these V.I.P. guests to Playmates who share their interests. The game's main interface should be familiar to Sims 2 players; characters are directed through their 3D domestic environments with mouse clicks, and clicked objects offer pop-up menus of available interactions.\n\nCoaxing powerful celebrity friends to appear in an issue of Playboy magazine can boost circulation, bringing in more income for future developments. As Hef, players can determine the content of each issue, choosing the articles, essays, cover shots, and centerfolds. They'll also have an opportunity to direct the photo shoots, choosing the location on the mansion grounds, the model, and the wardrobe selection -- all of which feature a \"topless\" option. The game includes a structured campaign that follows Hefner's real-life rise to international celebrity through a series of individual scenarios that focus on building the fame, circulation, and clout it took to develop the Playboy brand into what it is today. Players design their own challenges in the \"Empire\" mode, where they can set their own goals and victory conditions.","Publisher":"ARUSH Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2005-01-25T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5seAVzbctIw"},"14606":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Storm Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Images":[{"FileName":"47b34c88-14bf-4446-a894-5affe0480ed8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4e218c25-9ae5-4192-9ab5-9c1122135a3f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bab730ff-3cb2-41ab-a417-2466e81630d4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e88f43ba-cef5-46a9-98df-6d1994350e4c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ec0839ef-a3c2-48d4-b50c-0151d01e1557.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d86c5971-a837-4181-8cf1-fa01ff2b2a9e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"40937469-d26a-4270-9f11-cefd181a8f45.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0aafec34-0552-4f8d-b4d7-f67c6ac4966e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"969b7a90-b162-43ae-9ecd-999256d487cf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b32e0e5e-c5a7-44b3-be69-5dc8fd00a74a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"da9b2163-546e-4c0c-bc17-c9b934986516.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3","Overview":"The game is segmented into a series of fifteen separate missions, each of which begins with a briefing and a news report concerning the outcome of the previously completed assignment.

One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\nDynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"2001-11-26T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dynasty_Warriors_3"},"15577":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Shiny Entertaiment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"788595f7-d3eb-445b-b82a-56385f31514c.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"ba63fbaf-6ff8-428f-942b-54cef0960c64.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"184b4f85-941a-4767-abb0-43d795f8513a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"562dd906-e725-4215-a0ec-7f94433c1224.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ccab246f-211c-46bc-9bea-7f5087be9ad4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1e9b1305-0713-488d-bf97-525672960097.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cf265469-055a-4c47-ad3a-dffcf5b9dfa3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e0b02e0f-a2f9-428e-aff4-b7fd22fcf926.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"db2b907b-a19f-4816-b85e-adb4e1b2f574.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Matrix: Path of Neo","Overview":"At the start of the game, the player is hacker Thomas Anderson, and does not possess any of the powers that the character will later discover as Neo.

Instead, it centers on James Sunderland, who enters the town after receiving a letter written by his deceased wife, saying she is waiting for him in their \"special place\" in Silent Hill. Joined by Maria who resembles her except for a more provocative outfit and personality, he searches for her and discovers the truth about her death. Additional material in re-releases and ports included Born from a Wish, a sub-scenario which focuses on Maria before she and James meet.\n\nSilent Hill 2 uses a third-person perspective and gameplay places a greater emphasis on finding items and solving riddles than combat, similar to the first Silent Hill. Psychological aspects such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter were added to the game. More humanoid than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed as a reflection of James' subconscious. Real-life references to history, films and literary works can also be found in the game.\n\nAn updated port of the Playstation 2 hit Silent Hill 2, the Xbox version includes the additional bonus content featured in the Greatest Hits version of Silent Hill 2, the new Maria scenario, that can be played separate from the main game.  It is playable via backwards compatibility with a hard drive equipped Xbox 360, but with several graphical glitches and issues that distract from the experience.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ou3F-JSsxtk"},"16734":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"American McGee Presents Scrapland"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MercurySteam","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"3a6ec651-1e0b-42db-bb10-5423eb223709.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f747faee-b9cf-49b2-a979-2b0a171a96af.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9aa06c4a-4315-4a13-b45e-c33d0cc2ba61.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8a1e1d5e-3b0a-4d02-aaea-3d05c2a8e7d1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"461065c7-65dd-422c-8427-839bc7befa70.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4e85af29-1f91-45cc-bbf1-b65a2f685851.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7a4a25c9-c222-4a9f-ba53-6687943267e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Scrapland","Overview":"American McGee presents SCRAPLAND is a third-person 3D action game set on an asteroid called Scrapland, a ruined paradise rebuilt by robots, the only inhabitants now.

The adventure begins when he accepts a job as journalist and strange things start to happen...\n\nThe game is a mix between free-form outdoor levels and indoor levels with combat and puzzle-solving elements. During said indoor levels the player can instantly change his form between 14 robots, all with their own advantages and special abilities. Utilizing those robots is important to solve puzzles or mini games, e.g. only a tiny robot can fit into small spaces and only certain robots are allowed into the areas. However, those disguises can be seen through by certain enemy types. Then it is a good idea to change to a robot with fighting abilities - aiming is basically done automatically by the game.\n\nThe outdoor levels can be freely explored, but there is not much more to do then flying to next mission objective or indoor level. The parts of the space ship can be upgraded individually; better parts are gained during the game and by solving optional missions. The player can have up to nine different space ships and switch between them if needed - a heavy one is better suited for fights while a small one is useful for races.\n\nAdditionally the game features various outdoor areas which can be started outside the campaign and three multiplayer modes.","Publisher":"Enlight Software","ReleaseDate":"2005-02-28T00:00:00-08:00"},"16801":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"99d78875-74b7-46d7-bb17-e4498a242a3e.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2cf101ad-a93b-4fc3-9c10-76174ee460ac.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"64c6c20e-356c-405f-9f12-9712aff793f7.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d9457bf4-63c0-4322-bb21-e49b8636128a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1ae07a9f-c250-410b-89ca-0d3eb946d490.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3f3b0054-40ff-4890-98c3-fa6e60894819.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"34f3f304-71b1-4944-8c42-9d13e8997139.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2048f855-0524-4491-8b79-948b608ef4a3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ea28d0c7-8dc7-4514-ab64-bd9c6c647a60.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"70ac968f-e77a-4683-a1d5-4fd72311c419.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7251ebe2-7efd-402e-b0f1-3963b5b3307d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bea0e8e1-a235-413e-9df1-8f84aece2c97.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Silent Hill 4: The Room","Overview":"Henry Townshend is a man living in a small apartment in South Ashfield, a neighboring town of the infamous Silent Hill.

Released after the NFL signed an exclusive licensing deal with Electronic Arts, it was released in October 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. This game is the first in the Blitz series to receive an \"M\" rating by the ESRB due to the graphic violence, explicit language, and drug use depicted. Lawrence Taylor, who provides voice acting for the game, serves as its official spokesman. In 2006, a second version of the game was released on the Xbox 360 in October. In December 2006, a portable version was released on the PlayStation Portable (under the title Blitz: Overtime). These versions included the voicework and likeness of former pro linebacker Bill Romanowski. The game was originally intended to be a Wii launch title, but the Wii-version was delayed[1] and eventually canceled.[2]\n\nOn January 22, 2007, the game was refused classification[3] by the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia, effectively banning the game there. The game was banned as the use of drugs was related to incentives and rewards.","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-12T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xjRQcJm164w"},"17063":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acclaim Studios Austin","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"949e1477-d884-4921-b608-51f3deed719f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"181b3f59-b584-4bf5-b4d7-a914413109b7.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f6b09fb-aec1-4772-b3a5-b165853e9d43.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6add5548-7e58-4723-848a-72951f2e1cf3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"68e6021d-c40a-45f7-8f79-65c0cfa2cfc1.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4ffe5b84-181f-44a8-aa69-a3ff13eb74d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Vexx","Overview":"On the forsaken remains of the planet Astara, the villagers of Rockhaven lived difficult but peaceful lives, until the day the Shadowraith, Dark Yabu, and his minions swept down from the sky.

These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI.

It is still considered live at this point. Obviously, this makes the game much faster-paced and higher-scoring.\n\nFeatures include a coach's pick which will recommend plays, a telemetry view, which lets you see how tired both your players and the opposing ones are along with passing routes so you can set good match-ups, a quick play mode, a season mode, which allows you to go up to 20 seasons and trade players, set salaries, etc, practice and online play.\n\nArena Football is officially licensed by the Arena Football League and includes all the teams and players from the 2006 season. New Orleans VooDoo is not included as they sat this season out due to hurricane Katrina, though their logo is available to use for created teams. Numerous historic teams are also available.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2006-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"17398":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team17","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8d1d15f0-55fe-4c34-8ef5-c093af1955a9.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6093412f-062e-4aad-b9ec-bd4d8153715b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f78cb85b-104e-442b-8165-5008ea23164a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"50b71e8c-cdc0-437d-959d-f145558515b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"26ae4748-9dc3-4707-a9c6-6dcd6e6a769f.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"91db4a75-48aa-447e-a575-228c9869fbaf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5b2a657b-7659-4963-a93e-e1161203ae52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Army Men: Major Malfunction","Overview":"Army Men: Major Malfunction is a game in the Army Men franchise released by Global Star Software in 2006 for Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles.

One of the best things about MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 2K5 WORLD SERIES EDITION that sets it apart from the regular baseball titles is the way that the designers have incorporated a new Pennant Fever mode as well as the World Series Championship Moments mode that allow players to experience the game of baseball from a new and exciting standpoint. In Pennant Fever mode players will get to play through the final games of the season from the basic franchise mode. Thus giving them the chance to only play through the excitement and frantic play that often encapsulates the last few games of the season. The Championship Moments mode, on the other hand is a little different in that it lets fans play through some of the greatest World Series moments throughout history in a type of simulation. This allows players to get directly on the inside of some of the games that changed the way America viewed baseball. The MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 2K5 WORLD SERIES EDITION is essentially the same great MLB game that comes out every year with a few bonus features, but those bonuses are well worth the money as they will easily pay for themselves with the hours of fun game play.","Publisher":"2K Sports","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-18T00:00:00-07:00"},"17539":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mass Media","Images":[{"FileName":"7dd1f309-1a6e-453f-85b2-973bac4bb663.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ef592567-a360-4181-a759-fd6e56d60769.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f84497bb-1c95-4322-b769-52cb031b0bef.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"da3131de-d851-42ff-92a0-1ba628ce746a.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"24b6e3bc-2769-474f-b55a-c5e026f32520.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Namco Museum","Overview":"A total of 12 games are offered in Namco Museum:\nPac-Man\nPac-Man Arrangement\nGalaga\nGalaga Arrangement\nDig Dug\nDig Dug Arrangement\nPole Position\nPole Position II\nMs. Pac-Man\nGalaxian\nPac-Attack\nPac-Mania\nFor the first time since their arcade days, Pac-Man Arrangement, Galaga Arrangement and Dig Dug Arrangement are ported to the home console.\n\nEverything is exactly the same as the original arcade versions, including the music, cut scenes, graphics, and even the many graphical errors that appear.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-08T00:00:00-07:00"},"17540":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"NHL Hitz 20-03","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Black Box Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7aea5e1c-6589-445e-8e76-afe8184ba9ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7a76d63e-e812-487f-8692-00c95bacae71.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b6f3df9-454c-401f-ac76-7373285ca65b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ab6769c4-cb6d-4296-bccb-d1526906c0bf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8db0df19-dac5-4d2b-9f0a-d10f1b6f47f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"NHL Hitz 2003","Overview":"The NHL Hitz series has been on all next-generation consoles since the early days of the 32-bit era.

You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy.\n\n The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role.\n\n Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign.

Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection \"medikits\" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.\n\nDuring missions, players can earn medals by the end of each level be meeting requirements such as completions of objectives, eliminating an amount of enemies and maintaining a percentage of health throughout, all represented by a bronze, silver or gold star.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JliA0A0M6z0"},"19275":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kush Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"07d48e55-6ade-4a56-872c-32bf458d2b8d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bba69a07-6a41-4224-926d-5e27dfebf7a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef5443dd-dd0c-4980-8013-8bcdded8b62f.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0884e451-378e-441e-b9df-ab8ea9efbf85.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"ESPN College Hoops","Overview":"From Wikipedia.\n\n\"ESPN College Hoops is an American college basketball video game which was initially released on November 13, 2003 for the Xbox and PS2.

Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JboF1LAnZOg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sniper_Elite_(video_game)"},"20204":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"848cf9bd-dc50-434b-b6b4-7f4e2ac2cc38.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8bf373c-32d5-411f-84e5-432944a6c361.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0dacca4-c761-4e17-be66-cf06c7bdc57d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"003da4e6-e401-461e-b301-be34e7e60a83.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8b298249-95e9-4d4a-b4f7-4d529ce2114c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"874f4b2c-5bf5-47da-8fe0-1e5915818391.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Steel Battalion: Line of Contact","Overview":"Steel Battalion: Line of Contact (Japanese: 鉄騎大戦 Hepburn: Tekki Taisen?) is a 2004 video game created by Capcom for the Xbox console where the player controls a VT (Vertical Tank).

Each and every guest has his own excitement and nausea tolerance, which will reflect on the rides' popularity and the park's tidiness. Hence, handymen are employed. Rides can also break down, and some of them can even crash, leading to a tragic ending. Mechanics can be employed to inspect rides for possible errors and to fix already broken rides. Security guards prevent vandalism in their line of sight, and entertainers keep guests happy while waiting in a long queue line. \n\nGuests are also impressed if there is some wonderful scenery scattered around the park, leading to an increase in the park rating. They all have their opinion on the park, so it is a good idea to check their thoughts every now and then, as the park rating depends on the guests' satisfaction.\n\nAll these features require money. Loan can be raised from a bank, but the more one borrows, the more the bank asks in return. Certain rides, or even the park itself, can also be advertised, while vouchers are also available for discounts or free rides or food.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RollerCoaster_Tycoon"},"21005":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Brain in a Jar Ltd.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"4f6e9e3a-1812-4f25-b041-2acd9b0d0a70.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a57920d8-dce0-4cbc-a0ee-bb9c8ea3cb6e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bf7ff3a5-918e-403a-9e67-8cb74bf9ee06.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa79e3b8-7886-4d14-8348-0339cf8e7268.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"41344390-c177-49df-b9a9-4cedfa8dd8fd.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5dd61904-1cde-4c68-97c3-5c3071763fb0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8c5b6925-d989-47ff-9e28-2607889d0d8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"IndyCar Series","Overview":"Codemasters' official game, IndyCar Series, is blisteringly fast, nerve-shatteringly intense, pure professional racing and features ultra-close pack racing with up to 33 cars racing on track.

Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It features a story arc from the movie, which was released on June 28, 2006, and more than 60 years of comic book content. EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman's superhero powers to save Metropolis.\n\nIn the game, Superman combats Bizarro, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains (including Mongul) as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS. A port for the PlayStation Portable was planned but cancelled due to it not having enough power to support the game.\n\nElectronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh(Superman\/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros. Pictures film directed by Bryan Singer.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version also features games based on the film, but they are fundamentally different from the console title. The games were delayed from their original release date (set to coincide with the theatrical release of the film) due to design complications and issues with polish on the console game. The handheld games were delayed in order to preserve a simultaneous release with non-handheld SKUs. The games were ultimately released on November 22, 2006 in the United States and November 30 in Australia, to coincide with the DVD release of Superman Returns."},"21515":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Black Box","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0bd8d643-de68-4169-8a51-a6392715777d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d97f505c-c985-4b01-ac5e-1b6f4abb491c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0a2fab1d-6f6b-4a79-b39a-1678e8c22ca0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"67d89777-5648-4e12-aee9-bcefc1a85a04.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ac2532f5-1d3d-4dee-b53f-d4be5764dd38.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"559c339b-d22a-428d-bb7f-f4d8917e8717.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c6423a43-c5fd-45e4-a8f5-2af4e0c0e95c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"NHL 2005","Overview":"NHL 2005 features Open Ice Control, which according to EA allows better control, including moving players without the puck and also a complete World Cup mode where each team can be created from scratch.

The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature.

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.\n\nHis objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.\n\n\nAs the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2004-02-17T00:00:00-08:00"},"22708":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"2K","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7c883068-1e70-4a2e-b268-33fcfcc7c7fc.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"00463f48-be68-4616-b399-cf701db573d1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a45946f9-1536-43e6-b544-f4ac9450d4de.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aadf5b04-176f-4561-9be5-1e93cef3d7d0.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d18538c0-0ee0-44d8-a909-81e33f1ab6a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ab38402c-8a46-4470-accc-5cae71738ca7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Virtual Pool: Tournament Edition","Overview":"The leader in video game billiards chalks up for console with Virtual Pool: Tournament Edition.

The game was released in North America on February 28, 2002 for the Xbox console.\n\nTapout was published by Crave Entertainment and developed by DreamFactory. The subtitle Tapout refers to a fighter tapping his hand indicating that he has submitted to a submission hold. A tapout, along with a knockout, judge's decision, and referee stoppage, is one of the ways of ending a UFC bout.\n\nThe game features many of UFC's top stars including Matt Hughes, Chuck Liddell, Mark Coleman, Frank Shamrock, and Tito Ortiz. Competitions can take place in several modes such as exhibition, tournament, arcade, and championship mode. Several fighters throughout the game are unlockable such as two female competitors and celebrity Ice-T.\n\nUFC: Tapout received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. A sequel to this game entitled UFC: Tapout 2 was released in 2003. Other than an updated roster, the game is very similar to the first Tapout and received similar reviews. Tapout 2 was published by TDK Mediactive.

This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller. This is just one small change that adds to the overall amazing gameplay of NHL 06.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-06T00:00:00-07:00"},"24136":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"726705a6-867d-483e-a653-17378a9b5448.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"589851e9-ee9c-4aa6-ad09-1fc25e909c64.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a8052230-a6eb-4781-b5d2-8eb1a96d3402.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6fc3c034-0b83-4bf4-be70-8242e44ff008.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"97f42276-5c4a-4cb6-a7b4-2c977f32c7d3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f52f9b78-d7be-45d0-bee7-319dcbc98962.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2901fc37-ec6a-414d-9dd1-61e2aa5244f3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d3a9f24c-a085-46f9-993b-fb100beec7d1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"330a18bc-451e-4ce2-934f-f125cbc3032e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4fd2079a-991c-4816-b4b3-900fcee8729c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"22d94739-e309-46c6-b438-c963bbf5eaa5.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4bcfadb6-2ab9-4e1e-ac79-4a3d38b4dc49.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f022a1f6-1c95-488a-8bb8-9b074b1e0f1f.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"54fb5c02-3e33-4c7b-b0cf-14c9b8312604.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c621e3a8-3dcd-43e9-8ccb-ffe0b73315e2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fcc09873-8872-473f-b705-b9700d710b70.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d05fc6be-159f-4442-bcea-591f1cab09ae.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e4e9e4df-5cf6-414e-b156-2bc5512092a3.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"569df93f-f140-49be-92e1-010c95a15ae3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1d35ebca-6378-4a57-a751-18cb93193196.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c06a2e6b-84e5-44e4-8380-ac8f124525cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"07c2aa35-e942-43f7-a2ab-a23f28d63357.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder","Overview":"In 2010, two years after the events of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, and one year after the events of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Desert Siege, Cuba is free, or at least it's supposed to be. Since Fidel Castro's death [in the storyline] in 2006, the island of Cuba is wary of the communist rule it had been under for nearly 50 years. It's time for the first free and open elections since Carlos Prio Socarras, who was overthrown by Batista in the early 1950s. The FDG (El Frente Democratico de la Gente or People's Democratic Front) has fronted a man named Ariel Priego as their candidate. The FDG are an outspoken anti-American political faction that wishes to return Cuba to its long-standing communist dictatorship. Although the FDG publicly denies utilizing violence as a means of coercion, the reality is quite the contrary, as the Ghosts quickly discover. Now it is up to them to set things right again, without making it appear that the United States is getting its hands too dirty, and ensuring the elections proceed smoothly.\n\nThe first few missions see the Ghosts conducting operations against arms and drug shipping operations by agents and allies of Priego, the ultimate aim being to prevent any strong-arming of voters on election day. When election day comes, the Ghosts are responsible for protecting a voting center in Havana, a task that proves none too easy as men loyal to Priego assault the building and take hostages elsewhere in the city. Unsurprisingly, Priego loses the election badly. Becoming desperate, he asks for help from his backers in Colombia, and FARC sends in hired soldiers to take Cuba by force. The Ghosts assist in defeating this effort, and FARC soon decides to cut its losses.\n\nRunning out of allies, time, and options, Priego flees to an old fortress in a hilled section of Cuba. The Ghosts are ordered to assault the fortress and capture Priego alive. If he is killed, he could be made into a martyr all too easily, something that would be highly detrimental to the new Cuban government. The Ghosts succeed, destroying a helicopter that Priego had intended to use for his escape. Trapped and with his remaining soldiers killed, Priego surrenders.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2003-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"24156":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Disney-Pixar Finding Nemo","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1ea50c76-6a46-48ca-bb23-824d10522eb6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2e2449d4-4c31-4e06-b22d-2d700da80829.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bae73886-08eb-4350-8197-24ee20381d64.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b492b26a-548d-4bc6-a4a3-4f872fde46ca.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d438a1d8-5196-4917-b91d-484a51108ca5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"896aa633-df7a-4e22-b7cb-a94b541be7d2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc998e79-4bcf-431a-9457-e7226f9a1e18.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"0e6e4881-acbe-478d-a413-ea3c77e213f6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d4b4dfff-4c8e-4559-afa9-904673b6dc98.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"83521e6b-9fb3-4561-91cd-fb82481d689d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6d5e93f5-7bed-44c1-b7ae-b1930e027ba8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cdb0f1ec-79b0-42f1-9a9e-665521cfbb8d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3da59cc5-7da1-46bb-9d2c-98002bba3819.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ba7417b3-be80-47a2-9ec1-51ca62cdfda9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Finding Nemo","Overview":"Finding Nemo is a 2003 action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales.

You soon realize that you have been led you into a trap orchestrated by anti-perestroika KGB conspirators, headed by a fictional KGB director Named Georgi Barinski. These conspirators want to stop you from uncovering their plans, and also get revenge for a previous news story in which you exposed a KGB operation in Berlin. To get you out of the way, they have switched your ordinary camera for one incorporating a cunning X-ray weapon, and have framed you as a CIA assassin who wanted to kill General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev (who, in the game, is somewhat incorrectly referred to as the \"president\" -- even though no such office existed at the time). Your goal is to escape the Lubyanka KGB prison, together with the head of the Presidential Guard, a loyalist named Grushkov who has also been framed. You must work with him to stop the KGB radicals from overthrowing the government, and to prove that you are both innocent.\n\nCold War's gameplay is based on stealth, similar to games like Splinter Cell or Dark Project. Being a journalist you are no weapons expert, so you should try to be stealthy and attack only when necessary. To help even the odds, you can create useful gadgets out of items you find, improvising things like gas grenades, anesthesia ammunition or distraction items.","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-05T00:00:00-07:00"},"24296":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"05720c34-2ebb-4fb4-b113-216989bc2a73.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bc68ca48-7a9e-4af0-ad69-1df323c89928.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7e9216d0-6695-4633-b04f-3ad37ef51c33.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"585ff924-9365-4989-8f4f-630f5e7d6264.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cbcd670f-b378-4721-b2ed-c53c68198aaa.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"56d3ce9f-fe4d-4d0b-b76f-48236b1aa452.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dynasty Warriors 4","Overview":"Dynasty Warriors 4 (真・三國無双3 Shin Sangokumusō 3?, Shin Sangokumusou 3 in Japan) is a hack and slash video game and the fourth installment in the popular Dynasty Warriors series.

The game is available on PlayStation 2 (PS2) and Xbox and is based on a series of books called Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written by Luo Guanzhong. As the series has progressed, it has strayed further from the actual plot of Romance of the Three Kingdoms but instead has given the user more input on how the storyline progresses.

In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending.

The Crib serves as a showcase for all of the bonus items and awards you win by completing objectives. The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game's menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games.\n\nAnother feature added to this game is first-person football.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.\n\nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.\n\nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.\n\nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.\n\nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.\n\nKnockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.\n\nAfter Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series)."},"28476":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubi Soft Entertainment Software","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"0811725b-907f-4170-913a-aee0b9f2c344.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fdbab6f5-dd09-4bba-9f76-347cca29a4db.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bc00d874-1140-4938-a42f-8a1504b8bed2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fc7a9354-7f19-49db-b221-3cbcb84def9b.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e8549b4e-1054-445d-860a-2f7bef8f1e2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Largo Winch: Empire Under Threat","Overview":"This adventure game is based on the famous comic book character of the same name.

The game was released in September 2001 as the second installment in the Silent Hill series. An extended version of the game was published for Xbox in December of the same year, containing a short bonus scenario and other minor additions. It was later ported to the Microsoft Windows operating system in 2002. A remastered high-definition version of the game was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 in 2012 as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection.\n\nWhile set in the series' eponymous fictional American town, Silent Hill 2 is not a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game. Instead, it centers on James Sunderland, who enters the town after receiving a letter written by his deceased wife, saying she is waiting for him in their \"special place\" in Silent Hill. Joined by Maria, who strongly resembles her, he searches for her and discovers the truth about her death. Additional material in re-releases and ports included Born from a Wish, a sub-scenario which focuses on Maria before she and James meet.\n\nSilent Hill 2 uses a third-person view and gameplay places a greater emphasis on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter were added to the game. More humanoid than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed as a reflection of James' subconscious. References to real world history, films and literary works can also be found in the game.\n\nSilent Hill 2 received critical acclaim from critics. Within the month of its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with the greatest sales in North America. English-language critics praised the atmosphere, graphics, story and monster designs of Silent Hill 2, but criticized the controls as difficult to use. Since its release, the game appeared on several critics' top lists for its story and use of metaphors, psychological horror and taboo topics as well as its soundtrack\/sound design. It is now considered by many critics to be the greatest horror game of all-time, and is widely recognized as one of the greatest video games of all time."},"28496":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sonic Team","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2068568b-05c0-41c8-8345-23948a1b8445.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5c8cbb07-6dac-45e2-b66e-94f7c5b42d6c.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"38777f81-a95b-4f84-9a2c-07c4b30991cc.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"05869bb1-83b6-4828-b530-bcbec5da9a37.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1a780b0f-4713-4113-bdc9-fcfbdd5451b3.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"23d070a6-f38f-4f88-83f2-b2d8bd3c56a7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7a83e3b8-0596-4912-9f5f-444b201a4d1d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a9a91f3-544f-4544-825e-f75c5b51f71b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7abaf986-2790-402c-9d7b-8cb1b8f2b75e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f161a104-3177-4a57-9b76-c1be11c36877.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"593bf1e8-f65d-4749-9ab5-38ec229e31d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0ef9c0e2-80d7-4802-aa1e-9e97c12737ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Sonic Riders","Overview":"Sonic Riders (ソニックライダーズ Sonikku Raidāzu?) is a 2006 video game spin-off developed by Sonic Team, with production assistance by Now Production, for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and Microsoft Windows.

The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game.[1]\n\nBefore FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped.\n\nHowever, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager).\n\nOne of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC Fútbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager José Mourinho was selected for the main cover.\n\nWhile the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed for EA Canada by Budcat Creations.[2]","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2003-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FIFA_Manager#Total_Club_Manager_2004"},"28512":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Canada","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"8cd55cf5-0796-46fa-9d34-7b0a95cd85b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c0d6879c-c2e8-499e-9549-919363874b3a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"47c049eb-90fa-4ec8-8a57-4e0c5fdb536f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26bb1242-29ca-438e-86e1-61a65510d20e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1683d1ab-3cc3-4557-b84e-9d3ff7d880bb.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a1087721-265f-48c5-bd08-b93102960313.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"UEFA Euro 2004","Overview":"As a tie-in with the European soccer championship, held in Portugal on June 2004, EA Canada created this spin-off of the FIFA Soccer series.

Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film."},"29028":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a51b0dd1-47d9-46d5-a255-b5764697bcbf.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ac404ddf-aa12-4601-90d1-ccd9dc70fd5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b01bbbf3-a821-4a3d-ae3f-1684f4e934cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"24d9abf4-8755-49f7-9042-698395c9f0d2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"David Beckham Soccer","Overview":"David Beckham Soccer is a football sports video game for PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color.

While the Total War series traditionally focuses upon real historical scenarios, the plot of Spartan: Total Warrior is fictional, involving figures from both Greek and Roman mythology, and featuring many ahistorical elements (the most obvious being the Roman Empire and the Spartan state did not exist at the same time in history). It is also the only installment in the series to have been released for video game consoles rather than PCs or Macs. It was the first Total War game published by Sega, who had purchased Creative Assembly earlier in 2005.\n\nSpartan received a mixed to positive reception.

Players assume his role as he undertakes a crusade to avenge the death of his old friend, \"Doc\" Fassenbiender.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TGGtjEeE3A4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crimson_Skies:_High_Road_to_Revenge"},"30337":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ricky Ponting International Cricket 2005"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2a626f72-6826-4208-a784-373091392186.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1251868a-4b34-40d3-b2d9-91055034e709.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b1304d3b-2a03-428b-a0fe-db821cbb6cdf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0a5dd0cb-be00-4c02-8a27-94e3422c3276.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"505dbae5-9802-4b9a-b331-29c7ffc2eb9f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c6a7d0c0-b20b-4d68-aca3-e6659ea336b7.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"770b3807-10df-4709-bf07-0d730addcbf6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1771d724-e136-4ef7-b7ba-28d11997580a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"1932d732-f094-45bd-8aee-34f6234be451.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f2f65080-477f-48c8-b96c-07ce3b48d680.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"98448639-4015-4e2a-9bfd-d4d1bc86af3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Brian Lara International Cricket 2005","Overview":"Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 (BLIC) (also known as Ricky Ponting Cricket in Australia and New Zealand) is a cricket video game from Codemasters, available on Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows PC platforms. released on 21 July 2005, which was the first day of the 2005 Ashes series.

Rhama and Areliano are betrayed, and soon the Captain finds himself on the run; but that doesn't mean that he abandons the quest.

It was developed by Playlogic Entertainment and published by Evolved Games, after being originally developed by Engine Software for the Game Boy Advance. \n\nThe space-witch Aguira, a young fragile girl, has turned the world of Mardar into living hell. Her sentence is death by the Maelstrom, a gigantic black hole. But on route to the Maelstrom, the ship that carries her is hit by a meteorite full of Xyanide, which allows her to materialize her thoughts and escape. Her first target, unsurprisingly, is Drake, her executioner who accompanies her into the Maelstrom. His ship becomes entangled into her world, and he has to fight her demons and destroy the crystals that power her devilish creations.\n\nXyanide is essentially a 2D shooter, though technically, the graphics are three-dimensional. The player character advances automatically, the screen scrolling forward and often changing the camera view. The path is not entirely linear: at certain intersections, the player can choose where to go next. The game encompasses six large levels; regular enemies, mid-bosses, and end bosses will try to do everything in their might to foil Drake's mission.\n\nDrake's ship has two primary weapons, which can be switched at any time. One is a spread attack normally used against small enemies; the other is a concentrated laser that's effective against bigger targets. Both weapons also have an alternate firing mode, homing missiles. All these can be upgraded during the course of the game. Collecting power-ups not only strengthens the weapons, but allows the ship to perform various offensive and defensive manoeuvres.\n\nThe game is story-driven; animated cutscenes appear between the levels, advancing the plot.\n\nA sequel titled Xyanide: Resurrection was released for the PC, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable in 2007.","Publisher":"Evolved Games","ReleaseDate":"2006-08-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"33352":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"edb7ba51-3e8b-44ae-9d4b-e0a110138ec8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ba8fb4b3-356b-432a-a278-1f5d0daf4b6a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"de6fbcea-fe70-4878-9b7a-193a342a6882.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7707820c-b89d-4cdb-92b6-caf51de99584.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"ad7c266a-5363-42fb-999a-67137c32746a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"df782f9c-7b61-4b99-8aa3-37e57b0d0f4e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4d9dd10d-c7fd-43dc-b561-ddf36332aac2.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3567292e-18ad-4f82-8d49-d43820ce629d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d2e1f533-73e0-42e1-b3ec-af53ed91d614.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"310f1689-ea28-4911-adb3-757fe0005ff0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Street Fighter Anniversary Collection","Overview":"To commemorate the 15th birthday of its world renowned street brawler series, Capcom presents Street Fighter Anniversary Collection.

By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. \n\nRayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman's main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the \"shoot\" button. \n\nThe game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. \n\nRayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors.

Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman's health bar. \n\nThere are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games. \n\nThe Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are straight ports of the original game with HD textures and a smooth framerate.

It was developed by Pandemic Studios, published by THQ and released in 2006 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows.\n\nSix months after the fall of the regime, the coalition had established an interim government to transition Zekistan into democracy, but severe problems were also emerging. Various insurgencies began to plague the country and ethnic divisions were again causing sectarian conflict. Across the country, the Mujahideen Al-Zeki, an Al-Afad loyalist group led by Mullah Abdul Hassan began to fight coalition troops in an attempt to re-establish the old regime. Another key faction was the Anser Al-Ra’id, a northern ethnic Zeki faction led by Mullah Qari Ra’id, seeking northern ethnic Zeki independence in the province of Tien Hamir under his rule. The previously peaceful province and its regional capital city, Khardiman, became a focus of the fighting in the country when Mujahideen forces stage an uprising, bringing them into conflict with American forces, British UN Coalition forces, National Militia forces under the control of regional governor Andrei Zakirov and the Anser Al-Ra’id forces. To make matters worse, Anser Al-Ra’id forces soon turn on American, Coalition and National Militia forces. But British forces were able to re-take the Tien Hamir Bridge from insurgent control and US forces were able to re-take most of the city, halting a possible civil war between the Mujahideen, Al-Ra’id forces and government.\n\nThe game was divided into four chapters, each chapter containing three missions. The first chapter takes place in present time, while the other three chapters were precursors to the first chapter.","Publisher":"THQ Inc.","ReleaseYear":2016,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1tcs5c9pCyY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Full_Spectrum_Warrior:_Ten_Hammers"},"93158":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microids","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"19d2b756-4840-4bc4-8ca6-15d8d9e72ded.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0314b156-1d26-413b-bd92-dc0fcdb2388c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88a000e7-a78c-43db-8aeb-e363ec1d92ef.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8f0a691a-68ac-4131-a03c-a338a393b4e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Knight's Apprentice","Overview":"In a remote part of Avalon, known as the floating isles, a now secluded Merlin is busy with the education of Memorick, his young apprentice.

It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team, the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where players can scout out their new players in exhibition games.\n\nAside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major, follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The player's girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also boost popularity and overall success. Characters can be uploaded to Madden 07 where it can determine their draft position. The game is also aligned with ESPN, updating with real news from ESPN Radio and ESPN.com. It features the voice talents of Lee Corso, Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit.\n\nThe 360 version lacks the Spring Drills and Campus Legend modes. Instead it has improved graphics and a series of mini-games.\n["},"111210":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Saffire Corporation","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"4edd0e9e-127b-4e87-8c88-db7527793f56.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"63836714-bda0-4aea-b87f-fa96c126f8b6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ea43729-dc3a-443d-9c90-913f93e2b33a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4480e486-179a-40f6-b7e8-121bff04f2ab.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7173f5c0-b00f-4b8a-a076-dd2ba6e3476e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"499bb6ba-d481-4f8b-97a6-43366acc37c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Van Helsing","Overview":"Take the role of Van Helsing, legendary monster hunter and fight through Transylvania towards Count Dracula.

The game is set in the future. Tokyo, Japan's capital, was destroyed in a nuclear explosion early in the 21th century. But some years later the Tokyo of the nineties was digitally recreated. People live in a virtual world, and everything is ruled by computer programs. But some programs don't work correctly, and one day, a pop concert is disrupted by a terrible demonic vision. A special agency recruits the hero of the game, Kei (which can be either female or male, depending on your choice), to travel through the virtual world and to confront the hackers who might pull the strings behind the scene.\n\nLike in all Megaten games, demon summoning plays an important part in \"Nine\". You can have several parties, up to eight characters each, and form them at your wish from the demons you manage to recruit. Talking to enemies is even more important now, as you get experience points from equipping items and not from battles. You can also fuse demons to get more powerful ones. The battles are now in real time, both parties attack simultaneously, and precise timing is required. In addition, some portions of the game are occupied by virtual battles between hackers, which resemble a strategy board game.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2002-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Nine"},"129994":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Canada","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"8eedf9e5-fef2-4499-9add-2b48e8b8460b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"23651654-7289-4977-b7a3-4ac74ee0537c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8f095dd7-cbca-4ba4-84b2-dcab4564e330.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a7891ba6-2374-4717-bc53-423953a3d448.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2e4675d9-3abe-47c5-9797-4cc05c03139f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3e33b659-b41a-4368-8379-e5c8aaafef60.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"57b9fe60-7344-4fe5-a6e9-c1b984d9eccc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11cfb471-96ab-45bb-9989-39796a76bc39.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"57441b44-803a-40e8-b90e-e627f8bd7440.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6854e873-9e33-41cd-aa9e-aac5ede5f389.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"410c9a78-d06b-424f-80a4-33e6d19fdca6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rugby 2005","Overview":"Rugby 2005 is a game in the Rugby series by EA Sports.

It features the 2002 champion Tony Stewart on the cover with a scowling look to represent the new Grudges and Alliances feature. It was the only game as of 2002 to feature the previous Winston (Monster Energy) Cup Champion on the cover. The game had the most extensive soundtrack of the series up from four songs from the previous game. The game also has a career mode, season mode, Lightning Challenge mode, SpeedZone, as well as a tutorial mode featuring Richard Petty. The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other EA Sports Bio games like Madden NFL 2004 and NCAA Football 2004.\n\nThe main feature of the game is the \"Grudges and Alliances\" feature, which is based on the player's driving style and attitude. If the player drives dirty and bumps into other drivers, even if it was an unintentional bump, that driver becomes a \"Rival\", and will bump into the player if they happen to encounter each other later in the race. However, if the player drafts the opponent (a new feature for the game), that rival's level in grudge severity drops. If the player drafts a neutral driver long enough, that driver will become an \"Ally\", and at times will let the player pass. Conversely, if the player bumps into an ally, their alliance will slowly drop. The maximum amount of severity for both grudges and alliances is -100 and +100, respectively. The player can see his\/her four highest grudges and alliances at the end of the race. In Season and Career modes, the grudges and alliances the player makes carry over to future races.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2003-09-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B5AJwhy1t2E","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NASCAR_Thunder_2004"},"135636":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"44ff15b3-1fd0-4923-90f0-4da17d779ab9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"75bed604-b244-4859-9b9b-1bf3c564d808.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1feefd2f-9ef6-4682-9a48-2482b16d2b61.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"72dd8033-3dd2-49db-ad7d-292d508031d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fdfc2746-bf72-4719-b8a7-20f07e88b8bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Digimon Rumble Arena 2","Overview":"Pick your favorite Digimon and battle your way to the top in this arena-style fighter based on characters from the Digimon TV show.

In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city.\n\nThe game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.\n\nThe title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the \"Get In, Get Up, and Get Out\" principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds.\n\nThe game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history. Artists such as Cope2, Futura and Seen contributed art to the game."},"153750":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ac68a4b0-448a-4b4d-b3a9-d60023f9efe8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f0be3202-9169-4980-9690-e5482a158448.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"936072c3-982a-4688-8da2-358da93107eb.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eee3dfaf-f185-4070-96c6-9a3a8c3108ee.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b60850b-78db-4c61-8359-1f845c7d7c46.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0bd225cd-ec10-40e6-bae0-7791b4678de8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a31b65e0-96ba-48db-8ae2-1717823ea76e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cf86f3df-4c78-4d0b-ac67-c92fddb753dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e69de897-b1a7-4c68-8894-61456433ed96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The King of Fighters 2002-2003","Overview":"This is a two-game release which includes The King of Fighters 2002 and The King of Fighters 2003."},"153758":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"MLB SlugFest 20-04","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Point of View","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"bfeee372-029c-4c6a-a3e8-42f6ab74ee1c.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"80a72573-8b15-4007-92ce-b191afc692b4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"653955e6-77c1-4d29-9551-760c7179086c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f9f7b5c9-108d-41c6-ac45-447f6481b5f5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f61609bc-3850-4f92-a44e-4e151cdc4f20.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d5c4ea63-b2c1-4fa0-a31c-fe4dd48cbc3f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bf706265-d997-424a-bea4-d7f798c3089c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fbaf1fb8-7719-444d-b16f-212af8967e54.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"MLB SlugFest 2004","Overview":"The second title in Midway's baseball series, SlugFest 20-04 continues to pour on the rough-housing gameplay, bizarre codes, and humorous commentary.

Players could take part in a single race on three choosable circuits Suzuka, Phakisa, Jerez or participate in a full season, eventually unlocking more circuits to be raced on. Players could ride as most of the MotoGP riders from 2002, except for a couple of riders including Valentino Rossi, Max Biaggi and a few other riders. They are unlocked by achieving a specific number of points in Stunt Mode . Stunt mode is when the player races a one lap race performing different stunts as wheelies, burnouts and powerslides for points. Points are also rewarded when overtaking another rider, driving clean sections, or ramming other riders so they crash. However, recently gained points are lost if the player drives outside the track or crashes. Also if the player fails to reach goal within the timelimit, all rewarded points are lost.

Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can \"catch on fire\". The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays.\n\nGame modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates.\n\nThe game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games.

In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. \n\nThis only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.\n\nLess innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.\n\nThe game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.","Publisher":"Oxygen Games","ReleaseDate":"2006-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ProStroke_Golf:_World_Tour_2007"},"153808":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Jaleco","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"fc064909-86c2-44ae-9411-ead3c242b49b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7423d1ff-1b71-499c-94b4-04ab75f4f214.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f35724e0-c87c-42ea-915f-c4059ee52bfc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a98b707-153a-410d-9e53-5cde5171b58f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"863405de-c548-4b34-be1b-cf860d80af6f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"02e47f03-be1f-48ce-81e3-b580900095e8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"40e4645f-acdf-4862-9558-8fb74311b4ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pulse Racer","Overview":"Pulse Racer is a Jaleco Xbox racing game released on January 2, 2003, albeit only in North America.

The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.\n\nThe general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.\n\nThe game has several mode to choose from:\nArcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.\nHome Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.\nSudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends.\nSurvival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.\nVideo Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.\nTutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.\nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). \n\nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs. As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting."},"153810":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Climax Brighton","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"b1e3fac3-ff86-492c-b4b1-08f4ac87f0fc.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b5e0ed7f-3c3a-42d5-a6d8-c3fc297ff7b1.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4a925be4-bdf0-44b3-bd4d-e9614923381c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"62cde758-b3da-473c-b9bb-feb42cae6a16.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"40e3249a-83d0-4864-bf2b-7e0fc4aa692e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5f534e0d-c0ee-49b5-8563-45bcb8e9d562.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1f123bbf-2f9e-47b6-83e4-9db5e95619c4.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"aad18bbf-b4f5-448a-b9a2-f2ea5391bef1.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4074c6ea-dda3-48c1-b08c-d6b65d094061.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"602354f1-f5ca-41b7-8543-74a7cbe309d6.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"19a142ca-7dc7-4b0d-8b33-3709dc4a0d62.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ab03fd4-7b80-4f9e-a5af-d9f19ee94290.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5bf698f2-5c71-4b76-b58e-f3940cac516a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"519ef12c-53fe-4155-af12-ee151df72591.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d82d70c3-f68a-4649-8eb5-ff615dbef8b2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4c38b733-53e4-4b5a-94e7-0e20389829ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e5c39511-672b-404c-9203-16c5108c7b7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rally Fusion: Race of Champions","Overview":"Rally Fusion: Race of Champions is a racing game released for the Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox consoles in 2002.

The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.\n\nThere are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent's tower first wins.\n\nCompared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode. Otherwise they are completely identical, both in gameplay and level design.","Publisher":"NA Synapse Software \/ JP Kemco","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egg_Mania:_Eggstreme_Madness"},"153821":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"9719c8f6-62e7-4204-ad41-c3868674e8cb.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"812625b4-326b-45e0-b366-b558a3c2c6cb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"53035432-9fc9-4b75-8068-7c2ea88c072c.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"69f0dc06-1e55-441e-8e0b-13ed56a572a0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d8c21612-e562-44c8-bc38-e74676376a60.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6a5cb76f-fa70-4b62-83fc-159495e03273.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"602e6696-a0f3-4a3b-ae27-b59d4cc1c274.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"a791be98-59ff-46a5-b47f-cfc5c987f6f2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"acbade1d-5fb2-4192-b354-aeae87715f84.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4530d1ed-2683-4f67-bf61-b680eecec2b5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ac03ec7a-5f69-4055-8ecb-8a74eb3c1331.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fbf4cc6c-638a-40c7-ade2-4b7ff2b41094.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"MotoGP","Overview":"The gameplay is very similar to past games by Namco, like MotoGP (PS2) and MotoGP 2 (PS2).

Unmasked","Overview":"Fred brings the rest of Mystery, Inc. along to meet his cousin, Jed, who works at the Monstrous Fright & Magic. MFM is a special effects company that creates monster costumes with a special formula they invented called, “Mubber”, that makes the costumes seems so real that the wearer literally becomes the actual monster. When they arrive, they found the location in shambles. Winslow Stanton, the creator of Mubber and owner of MFM, told them someone has stolen the Mubber formula and by using it with their animatrons, destroyed the building and disappeared. He believes it is Jed’s doing because he, too, disappeared. Looks like it’s up to Scooby and the gang to find Jed, destroy the costumed monsters and unmask the truth behind this great mystery!\n\nIn Scooby-Doo! Unmasked, you will guide Scooby to help Mystery, Inc. uncover clues, fight monsters and occasionally save your friends from danger. You will be visiting many several worlds including a China Town and a museum. You will encounter various monsters like the Chinese Zombie and the Black Knight and the only way to get past them is by attacking them with your spin, slide, roll and smash attacks! Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers. For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have. If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game. Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have.\n\nIn each world, when you’ve collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions. When that’s completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain.\n\nScooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu. You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points. You can replay any level as many times as you want so you can collect any missing items you still lack. In the extra menu, you will find Bonus Arts that features various conceptual art pieces used in the making of the game.","Publisher":"THQ Warner Bros.

New members become available over time, for replacement of dead and wounded. They may also be awarded historical medals.\n\nEach battle station on the player's tank may be occupied, and the gun sighting may be set to be very realistic. Better tanks become available during the course of time (Tiger I for Germans, later models of Sherman for Americans), close to the real availability of these models during WWII. Every few kilometres there are repair and ammo stations for when the tank is damaged by enemy fire. There is also a multiplayer mode for up to 32 players in each server, and the player gets to choose which tank they may use.[citation needed]\n\nThere are 18 missions, for German, Russian and allied campaigns. The first few missions are fairly beginner-friendly and easy, and they gradually get tougher and tougher as the player progresses. The game is very detailed and quite realistic, with most of the major tanks of World War II included in the various missions.

The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.\n\nAs most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called \"buzzing\" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again. \n\nAs in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen.

One day, while his parents are hosting a party, Taro ends up with the duty of ordering pizza; the pizza deliveryman arrives bearing not only the meal but an additional gift: the Rent A Hero combat armor. After unwittingly knocking his father out, Taro seeks training from the Sega fighting master Segata Sanshiro and becomes a part-time hero fighting crime and taking odd jobs, eventually going up against the evil Dr. Trouble.\n\nRent A Hero No. 1 is a remake of the 1991 Mega Drive original. The game plays out as an action RPG with a fighting system similar to Spikeout. The player controls Taro Yamada as he takes jobs from the SECA Corporation to pay the equipment fees for his Rent A Hero combat armor. He learns a wide variety of moves throughout the game, but must remember that he can only do anything useful with his power armor, and must make sure he keeps his batteries charged (by purchasing authentic Sanyo-brand batteries at the local convenience store). The game is steeped in Sega references and Japanese culture, with even the game's manual patterned on the comic magazine Big Comic Spirits.","Publisher":"Coolnet Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2003-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rent_a_Hero"},"158174":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Studio9","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"0788812d-2191-41ba-b86d-1227fdfcda61.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3c86979b-5651-463f-8c1d-68a22b33619a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dbe28705-8f9f-4cc9-9425-cd45cc023a49.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"65b20417-deda-4cfc-b8cf-66e08b97f7a4.png","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"ZillerNet","Overview":"The Ziller Net karaoke title contains a whopping 1500 songs, (up to 1,800 depending on selected song lists).

If you collect all of one color, then this charges up your blast to be much more powerful than simply your regular fired ball. For example, a full four blue water magics will cause a stream of water to be released at the end of your shot, flowing down the screen from that point through all walls and obstacles and hitting everything underneath its path. If you collect one of each color, then this will cause you to release an 8-way explosion of regular shots careening randomly in every direction. There's also chests scattered randomly around the battlefield, and inside are various power-ups (as well as power-downs) that affect your character in various ways: speed boost, homing shots, guided shots, etc.","ReleaseDate":"2002-07-04T00:00:00-07:00"},"160249":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ef7f15e9-5664-490f-a444-8585bef39622.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"471e1234-432c-4d48-857d-9aec684dac53.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7ea87635-cdac-4f31-90a9-877a587140e9.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"154b2465-1a2b-43a7-ac18-06869087ffe8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Shamu's Deep Sea Adventures","Overview":"In the game, Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, tries to destroy the SeaWorld theme park and replace it with Atlantis.

Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title.\n\nAfter a tutorial at Ollivander's Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.\n\nMost tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.\n\nAfter classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored.

However, using a lightgun will also require the expense of having to play the game without access to the aforementioned ES Mode, due to no Xbox compatible lightgun having a left trigger button needed in order to activate it.

Initially, dynasty mode has a limited number of events available to enter. Placing third or better in races unlocks new races, series of races, and championships.

Experience points (referred to in the game simply as XP) are acquired for various achievements during a race, such as passing opponents, or driving a clean lap. Similar to the way that XP is lost after dying in some role-playing games, failing to finish the race cancels all XP earned in the event. When certain thresholds of XP are reached, a new driver level is achieved, and a Skill Point is awarded. These Skill Points can be used to develop driver and car. Additional Skill Points are awarded for other achievements. Some races award a skill point for beating a particular opponent for the first time. There is also a list of dynasty achievements, the completion of which awards a number of Skill Points.

Naturally, our heroes Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine make their way toward the distant dark castle, challenging - and being challenged by - everyone you come across in a game of Puyo Pop.\n\nPuyo Pop Fever is a puzzle game of the falling-block variety, the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by combining four or more of the same color, which will then vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.\n\nThe game features a two-player mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.","Publisher":"Sega Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2004-02-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puyo_Pop_Fever"},"169423":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ca7930c0-9c47-43c2-9495-198b8cdf30a3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ce4d8be0-1a4a-43a8-b816-b836534144fc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aedd2548-36ab-4558-9098-a38a2985ca73.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3157794-1172-40b3-85c2-a23a89c86073.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7457c599-a226-42fb-98d5-2a25135bfa14.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f109f4ff-b7b5-4aaf-b8c8-44538e79facc.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"32f02171-472c-45a9-a79e-704e0a4f8e9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pool Shark 2","Overview":"Pool:shark 2 is a simulation of the pool sport.

Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament.\n\nAnother one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars. Characters created in this mode can be imported into the NFL Challenge, but also in Madden NFL 06.\n\nThe PSP version is a faithful port, with some of the cut scenes removed, and 3 new street modes added for Wi-Fi multiplayer: Street Slalom (an obstacle course), Style Point Challenge, and Style Standoff, a end zone dance contest, similar to Space Channel 5, next to the regular multiplayer modes. Up to four players can play on a single PSP in the Party Play game modes such as the 2 Minute Challenge and Jump Ball Challenge.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"169425":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"e031b8a3-c2f3-4713-ab0a-854e46f90f43.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"777cbeda-4e15-4303-b0c5-1ba0df361ab0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8f8ea28a-3e1d-4fc5-9e16-b600d3f8afd8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b9b5c968-e061-40ab-8c97-0ec86b4f5ff9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"02d16e18-b192-47a6-8942-f000b2016490.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rolling","Overview":"Rolling is a game about the exciting world of inline skating.

For those who do not know the TV show, it works like this...\n\nJesse and his team are to build a creation that will do a certain task within 7 days and by spending under $3000 and the vehicle must look stock when completed.\n\nSo this game gives you the task of building a vehicle that does something such as drive through a swamp by floating on the water and using a large fan to make you move.\n\nIn day one, you must design the vehicle. In the early scenarios, you only have one pre-made design to choose from. In later scenarios, you can choose from three pre-made designs.\n\nDays two through six are devoted to constructing the vehicle. You can buy various parts for the vehicle, but most parts will need to be fabricated. To do this, you will need to purchase raw materials such as sheets of metal or metal rods and assign the task of making something like a roll cage to one of the team members. They will make the item within a certain period of time while you handle other things.\n\nThings you need to do include removing parts from the vehicle or attaching parts to the vehicle as needed, and welding items to the vehicle or cutting items off the vehicle. Every weld and cut is already set up for you and you just follow the line indicated. Bolts are unscrewed or screwed on as needed.\n\nBy day seven, your vehicle will have to have been completed, or you will need to try again. Day seven is used only to update the look of your vehicle. This includes adding certain custom parts such as gold plated rims, painting the vehicle, and applying decals.\n\nOnce you are ready, you will take your vehicle to test it out and see if it works. If you made it to day seven without being required to start over, your vehicle will work. This is really just a test where you must complete a track in a certain amount of time. For example, in one mission, you will have to make it around a snow-covered track in your upgraded car that has snowmobile tracks added to help with tracking within a certain amount of time. You get as many tries as you need to complete this. Once done, you can move on to the next mission.\n\nThe challenges of this game are to stay under the $3000 when buying\/selling parts and to complete the track at the end.","Publisher":"Activision Value Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"169577":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Genki Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"e84f8ec6-aebe-44a9-989a-26c3e6c97b39.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2c5a5279-a91f-43fb-89e7-eebb17312672.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97fd3cec-0b0a-42d4-86b9-0313f60bebed.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7615961a-ec4c-4f19-8190-0dddd92ec09b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d66195a7-5fc0-4651-b52d-fa9d3fd22d0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Maximum Chase","Overview":"In this forever pursuit of a game, you play as a cop who has just got off duty.

It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a \"light\" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).\n\nThe main gameplay change was the addition of \"First Touch\" controls. By performing one of the \"trick\" moves before the player gets possession of the ball it's possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the \"Off The Ball\" controls (allows the control of players that aren't in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged.\n\nAnother new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums.\n\nAs it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11'000 real footballers.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2004-10-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FIFA_Football_2005"},"169695":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"0a1b82dc-6c67-4bf8-b3a2-38ab648034f8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"38e53957-6c90-4491-98ae-775ddbc952c9.png","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Flight Academy"},"169696":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"041d3ddf-521f-494b-a89d-3d472415d935.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9888e8aa-e7ad-454f-b651-3e380a12df66.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f5f05628-801c-4466-afb8-97dde3837113.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Frankie Dettori Racing","Overview":"Melbourne Cup Challenge (also known as Frankie Dettori Racing) is a horse racing simulation game based on the Melbourne Cup, Australia's most prestigious annual Thoroughbred horse race."},"169697":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"413cff5c-c5a1-43ff-b5b5-688deec21550.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3bd64424-7243-495d-8849-3a0235518601.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8b56d8f5-af1c-49ce-a728-b171e2ea18f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Fuel","Overview":"FUEL is a free-world racing game.

There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.\n\nThe general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects.

Each body part of a frame is armored, and after the armor on a part is destroyed any additional damage to that part will damage the frame itself, until eventually the frame is destroyed.","Publisher":"KiKi Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183666":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Xicat Interactive","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c4ed4099-c7f5-4b13-baff-25b9e17095de.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7407783f-7c3c-4d55-b497-48fc9ab7c2f4.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"420c2c41-40f7-47eb-9cc3-28ed816983f0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3127cb40-0097-4103-a236-2ed64c5723bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1eb146e8-51a1-46cb-9bf5-22d7c51db615.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"FILA World Tour Tennis","Overview":"Fila World Tour Tennis is a tennis simulation with a focus on fast-pace matches. The heart of the game is the career mode where the player creates his character and starts on place 100 of the world ranking. To become number one he has to win matches and tournaments - but he is on a very limited budget. Every participation costs money and if the first match is no success the career is practically over.\n\nThe player character also has stats which have an influence on the performance. These can be improved by buying better equipment or absolving costly training sessions which are mini games like hitting balls through rings. Other playing options are instant matches or single tournaments.\n\nThe game features 50 pre-created player characters and 24 courts which have to be unlocked in the career mode. The license is restricted to the sportswear.","Publisher":"Xicat Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187476":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Direct Action Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fb395169-1479-4173-8d54-681c3d235e49.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"19f27531-ac90-4c42-a590-507974033183.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ebbd1904-2729-4f9a-956f-95f7234c0948.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5c59f23d-0af7-4259-b02c-2d5856437cb0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b07f2a1a-7db0-4e31-b3ee-83efb00d068a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"91ab72d4-38a8-4ee4-8c40-5f0b8e3aea34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Combat: Task Force 121","Overview":"Terrorist acts have prompted the US government to call for the help of stronger military forces.

The game is set in medieval 13th century Europe and the Middle East. The story revolves around the new crusade of our hero to recover 3 ancient pagan artifacts essential to prevent the imminent attack of the demon armies into our realm of existence.\n\nIt is a 3D 3rd-person action game with RPG elements. Gameplay consists of completing quests through travelling in the various locations in the game or battling your way through enemy men and monsters.\n\nThe storyline for one is non-linear. At the start of the game you can choose 1 out of 3 locations to visit. Advancing in the game will unlock new locations. Each location is either a city or town where you can advance in the primary mission, obtain sub-quests, trade, meet people, etc. or it could be a dungeon type location crawling with monsters. Often its a little combination of both.\n\nMost of the gameplay (when not exploring cities) revolve around combat and character development. Combat consists of 3D 3rd Person Perspective point of view where you can attack enemies using various skills, abilities and attack combo's. Each of which can be upgraded at any point of the game by spending experience points to the pointed skill, ability or combo.\n\nOn character development, there are 3 major areas that may be upgraded: (1) Knightly Abilities; Spiritually oriented gifts of the Templar knight: from healing to other holy abilities. (2) Skill Abilities; These are usually attack-based skills. Various attacking styles to soften and defeat both men and monster. (3) Combo's. The extension of the \"attack button\". Upgrading the combo section provides additional attack moves.\n\nCombat also is uniquely divided into 3 different weapons. The first is the standard Sword and Shield, providing high defense and standard attack, useful in defensive stances and vs. ranged enemies; The second is the 2-handed weapon, primary for direct damage in close-combat against single or multiple enemies; The third is ranged combat using a crossbow. The perspective in ranged combat diverts to 1st person perspective (though you can still see your head).\n\nDuring the course of the game, you can obtain additional weapons and armor (as well as other items), either from the course of a sub-quest or purchasing it from a local trader.","Publisher":"Playlogic International N.V.","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"195523":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atomic Planet Entertainment Limited","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"2dffc88d-9f82-4e17-8d5f-e9ccffff2bbc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"705ee462-ca65-4d7c-abe6-18bb15fdb899.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"33de6d4d-f2d7-4502-90ea-f9790b3b44a6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2b956190-2f71-4808-9c00-c2f0e0fc1503.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Miami Vice","Overview":"Based on the 80's TV series of the same name, this is a 3rd person shooter. Playing as Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega's organization, following the plot of an episode of the series.\n\nThrough 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don't.\n\nIn the stages where the player can choose either Crockett or Tubbs, basic commands can be given to the secondary character, such as asking for following the partner or covering him. The characters will heal themselves as the time passes, and they can heal each other: if one of them dies, the other can revive him.\n\nThe characters can interact with the environment: whenever an action is possible, an icon will appear, showing which action can be taken, such as opening (or breaking) doors, climbing ladders, etc. Jumping is part of those particular actions, as the characters can only jump at specific places where the proper icon shows up. As for other actions, characters can run, crouch, walk and lean against walls. To shoot enemies, the player must aim (with an auto aim button) and then shoot (with a shoot button).\n\nThe game features the original theme from the TV show, as well as original voices.","Publisher":"Davilex Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2004-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"195613":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Codemasters Software Company Limited","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c3f841f2-6e79-45ff-96bb-ae128ec6be59.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Club Football: Inter Milan","Overview":"The only football game dedicated to real fans and real clubs.\nScore in a faithful replica of your club's home ground.\nA totally immersive experience with fully accurate strips, sponsors, and chants from your team's fans.\nCreate your own likeness and put yourself in the game using the powerful player editor and develop them into the clubs new superstar to carry your club to victory and the top of the league.\nCollect photos and video footage of the greatest goals from your club's history.\nMultiple game modes including: Domestic Season, European Super League, and Custom Tournaments.\nPresented by famous football pundits and commentators from across Europe.","Publisher":"The Codemasters Software Company Limited","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"195626":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Codemasters Software Company Limited","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7a41a3c0-d22c-4c26-800b-3145daef506c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b9ba2dba-92a9-4cac-8e6c-42a31bad04f0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d9bb9f07-58c3-4f78-863c-c1f578b7290e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Club Football: Juventus","Overview":"The only football game dedicated to real fans and real clubs.
