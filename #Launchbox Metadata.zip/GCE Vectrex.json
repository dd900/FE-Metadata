Pressing Left or Right on the analog stick moves your rider across the road, while Up is used for acceleration. The face buttons allow you to change gears (Slow, Medium or Fast), pause the game (a rarity on the Vectrex!), as well as grab the occasional water bottle from the side of the road (required to maintain energy levels so you don't slow down). The gameplay involves avoiding the sides of the track, while dodging debris and fellow riders; failing to do any of these results in your rider crashing and losing precious seconds. What's impressive is that the tracks aren't flat, and instead feature rolling hills that even seem to affect how fast your bike can move while ascending. The action is fast but the biggest problem is that it's completely unplayable once you move into the highest gear; here, the action becomes a flickering mess and it's almost impossible to avoid the obstacles and opponents with any sense of precision. The trick is to cycle constantly between second and third gear, but even then you'll never be able to build up enough speed to place in the top two riders. There's also a very thin line between successfully grabbing the water bottle and crashing into the side of the road; as a result you'll never feel in full control, and instead find yourself bracing every time you try to obtain it. Annoyingly, following on from a crash opponents frequently run you over once you begin cycling which stops you in your tracks and sees more seconds tick off the clock. The Game 2 option features a slightly different layout and more debris on the road; while it's nothing too interesting it's nice that the developers added a bit more content.","Publisher":"GCE","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BhP6uBPe5SA"},"133386":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"GCE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ee40bb6f-6043-49cd-93a3-fd9ac2730460.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"973b88cf-0e93-4120-adf1-c312c72e2caa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1d27082-03a8-40fa-b4d8-f51d2faa43e6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"08a222ce-b16a-4300-914b-5b9cba7a56e4.JPG","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e2e85d07-5f97-4623-9705-88241af0653c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"14fcbf2d-e47c-4b11-b1d6-c8b03e3713b5.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"25b530e8-9c8f-4cc4-9fb7-46e4f7455f53.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be8cc22a-394d-4b18-a704-1de4bb6d89c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5c5a6624-819e-46d9-88fa-822920b48111.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"3D Narrow Escape","Overview":"The goal in 3D Narrow Escape is to successfully navigate a ship through the narrow, fast-moving passages of the warlord's fortress, destroy the defense forces and avoid space debris.

The objective is to load five packages into your plane and deliver each one to a specific city before you run out of fuel. To increase the challenge, clouds must be avoided, otherwise you risk being hit by lightning and losing one of your five lives. What's most impressive is how the game is split into multiple sections to immerse the player. Prior to takeoff, you have full control over the flight path, allowing you to map the most efficient route; this is great for replayability and adds layers of strategy. Careful planning is crucial, and I found it helpful to take a picture of the drop-off points beforehand for navigational purposes! Next up is the mail loading sequence where you drag packages into the plane; the Lightpen lacks true precision, but for the purposes of what's required here it works fine. You then accelerate and takeoff using the controller, and enter the heart of the action; here, the game adopts a top-down view as you dodge clouds and search for the correct cities. It's slow-paced and relaxing like Pilotwings (1991, SNES) and controls beautifully. The threat of lightning is an integral part of the challenge, as without it, flying around and delivering packages would be easy! Its inclusion cleverly forces you to watch your fuel meter (as dodging clouds takes away precious fuel) while trying to be economical at all times. My only annoyance is that the flight path screen isn't always accurate, and it can fool you into thinking a city is located towards the right when it's actually diagonally-right. Once you've navigated to the correct location you simply press Up on the controller to land, use the Lightpen to unload, and repeat the process until each package has been delivered. As a whole, the gameplay is tons of fun and I love that the map and cities change each time you complete a route.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983},"133388":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"GCE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7c038901-a1e2-4925-8f02-5322ea9f8ea1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"34c5c648-515c-4ad3-8967-327922ca18f0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ecbe721c-4bbe-4200-aebe-ea51148d726b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"083bb3e8-2529-4963-a8d8-38e142540124.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"d18a62c1-4d57-4c62-8646-1d7f6567f2b8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"70c2d024-fd3a-447a-b2eb-2cc859fbe3bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44f04346-280e-4874-bfe5-525ca0836897.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4b22aa76-8d45-4388-a8de-fc36913df406.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pitcher's Duel","Overview":"Pitcher's Duel was an unreleased Vectrex baseball game.

If the player proves unsuccessful after two attempts however, they will have to face the Cosmic Dragon, at which point the only defence the player has left is avoiding its deadly fireballs.","Publisher":"Milton Bradley Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1983-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"141982":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8d867294-0803-4e55-9fcc-0378bae83e21.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cdb89dea-b069-45fa-9b60-44ba36c9b323.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"36bc96b9-77ce-4dfd-8be1-cd01ac700d49.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"38c7420b-0e5c-4daf-9ca3-ae5bbc2d2caa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"35767415-8c15-489f-b82a-de011a6793cb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"db8bc19c-bdb0-4bf9-9876-3afc4e25576f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bc2d8194-1264-4447-aab3-35c66cabdec3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Star Trek Debugged","Overview":"Welcome, Captain Kirk, to your command of the starship Enterprise.

At the time, he had acquired two different fixed version of Berzerk which contained several bug fixes. One was a GCE prototype dubbed Berzerk II and the other was a debug by Fred Taft from a disassembled ROM. Both fixed the crash and had a number of other optimizations.

The gameplay is similar to Galaga and consists of five waves that simply loop with increasing difficulty. Instead of using the analog stick you press buttons 1-2 to move left and right, while button 4 fires. It takes a few minutes to adjust but once you do you'll find the control scheme works fine. By pressing button 3 you can activate a shield once per wave (or re-use it if you lose a life) and this protects you from incoming fire and enemies. It's very handy and you'll want to use it when you're surrounded. The first wave sees you trying to blast down small birds but you can only fire one bullet at a time. The birds can spray multiple bullets at once and they often swoop in on you. The difficulty is high so don't expect to be eased in! The second wave is more of the same but this time you can fire two shots simultaneously which makes things more manageable. The third and fourth waves are the weakest as they feature large, flapping birds that take forever to shoot as their hit box is small (you need to hit them dead-centre). While they occasionally fly towards your ship they tend to only move from side-to-side making these waves easier than the preceding ones. The last wave is interesting as it features a boss battle, seldom seen on the system. You face a giant mother ship with a gaping hole in the centre; you instinctively know where to shoot but it's protected by swarms of birds that try to attack you. If you manage to beat the boss it explodes in a satisfying manner! As this is a high score game it's tempting to continually fire your weapon at will. However, I found it's better to be strategic and follow attack patterns as enemies will frequently line themselves up for a perfect shot.","Publisher":"Public Domain\/Freeware","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":1999,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=osU3VQwDueY"},"176388":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tutstronix","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"1bc91dda-0f86-438d-b711-08acce132758.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"602254ff-e412-416f-9f79-56d3477b008a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4abeaebd-9b4b-4fd5-a910-062210c175f3.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"53df7bf1-983a-4eaf-bab7-677a2a58ad4a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"985112ef-3287-4def-b464-a037effd121e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dd929d20-ff82-4b72-a83c-7f9c2711be83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Vector Patrol","Overview":"Vector Patrol is a faithful clone of Irem's Moon Patrol, recreated entirely in vector graphics.\n\nJust like in the original you have to navigate a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships.

Every five checkpoints mark a separate \"stage\" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus.\n\nDangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down.\n\nAfter completing the first course (the \"Beginner Course\") the player can try his skill on the harder \"Champion Course\".\n\nIn contrast to the original game Vector Patrol added a few bonus features like 3D animations after finishing a stage below par or unlockable achievements such as extra backgrounds, additional buggies or new course.","Publisher":"Tutstronix","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FuP5_FCJ1eA"},"176607":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tutstronix","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"6eaf5d67-2856-412c-a06f-1f156a16706f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"afa3f4dd-2db9-4de8-ad2c-a4703d9921ff.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cbbd0379-3fbc-4733-9d05-4d0df2a9a7e4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"920cab25-5870-4567-8029-301ada592d2d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e60af4d2-5148-4e40-8e67-25f468df8546.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Vectrexians","Overview":"Vectrexians is a clone\/variation of Galaxian developed and published in 1999 by Tutstronix.","Publisher":"Tutstronix","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":1999,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kq4yQdkhr5I"},"176608":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SDW Developments","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"330ae7a0-4119-47c6-846b-2e1772ae694b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d36020f1-24f3-4fd9-b6a9-8867ba998129.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36e6e6c8-ec04-4daa-859e-47f92eed4190.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e5e3a90-da1b-41da-b51e-d0a6ffda3cee.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"2b412b70-8b7b-4eb9-a7f9-b63b9c9d153e.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cf00bbaf-0032-444d-acd1-331e08538f7f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Vectrexagon","Overview":"Vectrexagon is a rhythm action game similar to Hexagon.

There are three options on the main menu: Sherrif V Bandidos (single-player game), Outlaw Hill (two-player game) and Townsfolk Gallery (overview of all the saved people).\n\nIn Sherrif V Bandidos the player's character is a sheriff in the middle of the screen that can be freely moved around in any direction using the joystick. He is surrounded by outlaws that move around him clockwise. They sometimes shoot and move inwards. The sheriff can fire in the direction he is facing and needs to take out the bandidos. However he also needs to protect an innocent townperson who follows his around and needs to stay alive.\n\nThere are twelve stages in total, each with a different character to save and an increasing difficulty level for instance introducing exploding TNT. Sticks of dynamite can be picked up quickly before they explode to disable them. After shooting a bandido a bird appears near the top of the screen. After completing a level a bonus can be played as a quick-draw shoot-out shown from a behind view with only a single bullet. Quick reflexes are needed to shoot first.","Publisher":"Vector Republic","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2019},"192487":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John Dondzila","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"10da12a0-dc61-4795-9f4b-065a63b100e7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc31a172-6a1a-4588-a991-0b538b644f32.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b8dfd9fa-4274-40e2-9e0a-237eed9252d9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wormhole","Overview":"WORMHOLE – clone of the very classic arcade game Gyruss, where your ship spins around the screen in a giant circle to destroy as many enemy ships as possible.

(from the All Good Things cartridge) to how incredibly fast the enemy ships swarm in and out of the center of the screen (the “wormhole”). At first this seems like Dondzila’s easiest game to date, since the ships can pass through you without harm and they don’t shoot back, but that won’t last for long (isn’t that always the way?). Making up for not having any of the cool music and the bonus stages, you’re granted three power-ups (rather than the arcade’s one) upon shooting special ships: double shots, destroying everything onscreen, and slowing down the action for several seconds.
