At these point ranges, a high number of robots return fire simultaneously and overload the memory needed to keep track of all the projectiles. In addition, robots can no longer shoot through walls.\n\nHomebrewer Mark Shaker released Berzerk Debugged as part of Vectrexcarts.com. At the time, he had acquired two different fixed version of Berzerk which contained several bug fixes. One was a GCE prototype dubbed Berzerk II and the other was a debug by Fred Taft from a disassembled ROM. Both fixed the crash and had a number of other optimizations.

The gameplay is similar to Galaga and consists of five waves that simply loop with increasing difficulty. Instead of using the analog stick you press buttons 1-2 to move left and right, while button 4 fires. It takes a few minutes to adjust but once you do you'll find the control scheme works fine. By pressing button 3 you can activate a shield once per wave (or re-use it if you lose a life) and this protects you from incoming fire and enemies. It's very handy and you'll want to use it when you're surrounded. The first wave sees you trying to blast down small birds but you can only fire one bullet at a time. The birds can spray multiple bullets at once and they often swoop in on you. The difficulty is high so don't expect to be eased in! The second wave is more of the same but this time you can fire two shots simultaneously which makes things more manageable. The third and fourth waves are the weakest as they feature large, flapping birds that take forever to shoot as their hit box is small (you need to hit them dead-centre). While they occasionally fly towards your ship they tend to only move from side-to-side making these waves easier than the preceding ones. The last wave is interesting as it features a boss battle, seldom seen on the system. You face a giant mother ship with a gaping hole in the centre; you instinctively know where to shoot but it's protected by swarms of birds that try to attack you. If you manage to beat the boss it explodes in a satisfying manner! As this is a high score game it's tempting to continually fire your weapon at will. However, I found it's better to be strategic and follow attack patterns as enemies will frequently line themselves up for a perfect shot.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osU3VQwDueY","Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"John Dondzila","Publisher":"Public Domain/Freeware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"7ee73671-813e-4f89-8aeb-2fbe12ccce0f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"6c332024-cd46-4625-b8e8-4af856c99eeb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"57f757fc-5c40-43a8-aaec-94a3bfec07f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"696bc0d1-c0f0-41e2-9016-a49146e7bde8.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"f72fe0aa-9766-44b5-bacc-699e7bff3125.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"c71e0308-3a47-4e93-8398-b5df3992b593.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176385,"FileName":"cab639bb-511b-4be9-94bd-e46cb6f55b3c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":117468,"Name":"Blitz!

There are three options on the main menu: Sherrif V Bandidos (single-player game), Outlaw Hill (two-player game) and Townsfolk Gallery (overview of all the saved people).\n\nIn Sherrif V Bandidos the player's character is a sheriff in the middle of the screen that can be freely moved around in any direction using the joystick. He is surrounded by outlaws that move around him clockwise. They sometimes shoot and move inwards. The sheriff can fire in the direction he is facing and needs to take out the bandidos. However he also needs to protect an innocent townperson who follows his around and needs to stay alive.\n\nThere are twelve stages in total, each with a different character to save and an increasing difficulty level for instance introducing exploding TNT. Sticks of dynamite can be picked up quickly before they explode to disable them. After shooting a bandido a bird appears near the top of the screen. After completing a level a bonus can be played as a quick-draw shoot-out shown from a behind view with only a single bullet. Quick reflexes are needed to shoot first.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Vector Republic","Publisher":"Vector Republic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190901,"FileName":"e244c3af-6012-431c-9a47-b56353e18a53.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":190901,"FileName":"7213ef6c-8d6e-4bf8-982b-a3b6d6dbd33a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":190901,"FileName":"52b0892d-7897-4c81-9dc3-112d269c4c20.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":190901,"FileName":"731733d3-e9d5-4ff4-9eac-399eb558fea9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":190901,"FileName":"48adfd60-7137-422d-aeb1-92ebc4c0139e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177825,"Name":"Gravitrex","ReleaseYear":"2002","Overview":"Based off the arcade game Gravitar - but with many enhancements.

The objective is to load five packages into your plane and deliver each one to a specific city before you run out of fuel. To increase the challenge, clouds must be avoided, otherwise you risk being hit by lightning and losing one of your five lives. What's most impressive is how the game is split into multiple sections to immerse the player. Prior to takeoff, you have full control over the flight path, allowing you to map the most efficient route; this is great for replayability and adds layers of strategy. Careful planning is crucial, and I found it helpful to take a picture of the drop-off points beforehand for navigational purposes! Next up is the mail loading sequence where you drag packages into the plane; the Lightpen lacks true precision, but for the purposes of what's required here it works fine. You then accelerate and takeoff using the controller, and enter the heart of the action; here, the game adopts a top-down view as you dodge clouds and search for the correct cities. It's slow-paced and relaxing like Pilotwings (1991, SNES) and controls beautifully. The threat of lightning is an integral part of the challenge, as without it, flying around and delivering packages would be easy! Its inclusion cleverly forces you to watch your fuel meter (as dodging clouds takes away precious fuel) while trying to be economical at all times. My only annoyance is that the flight path screen isn't always accurate, and it can fool you into thinking a city is located towards the right when it's actually diagonally-right. Once you've navigated to the correct location you simply press Up on the controller to land, use the Lightpen to unload, and repeat the process until each package has been delivered. As a whole, the gameplay is tons of fun and I love that the map and cities change each time you complete a route.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"GCE","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"1d2670e5-597d-4f61-8e68-fb5f9bedd60f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"3fcd3a2b-aab4-4874-b5b4-ad7f27b2ba7e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"5ee5e6b8-8fab-4212-a4ce-0c5086d974f2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"f6e8cf72-90d1-4d1e-aa07-28f93378609a.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"bc5ca90c-74c9-4953-b75b-0be474c7bdc9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"7323aab4-a1a8-4a43-b386-4faa5d3bc3ee.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"3bb7233a-0bf6-4909-aa23-77b8ed88356a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"2783e834-b323-4719-9adf-aed373cd3d1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133387,"FileName":"49f8e98e-22de-43c8-8217-86f51362fd92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127474,"Name":"Melody Master","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"MELODY MASTER is a high performance learning tool that's easy, educational and most of all...fun!

Standard rules for baseball apply, however fielding, throwing and base runners are all controlled by the computer. At the start of the game Player 1 always pitches first. If a two player game is selected, then Player 2 will be at bat.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"GCE","Publisher":"GCE Services","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"7c038901-a1e2-4925-8f02-5322ea9f8ea1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"34c5c648-515c-4ad3-8967-327922ca18f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"ecbe721c-4bbe-4200-aebe-ea51148d726b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"083bb3e8-2529-4963-a8d8-38e142540124.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"d18a62c1-4d57-4c62-8646-1d7f6567f2b8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"70c2d024-fd3a-447a-b2eb-2cc859fbe3bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"44f04346-280e-4874-bfe5-525ca0836897.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133388,"FileName":"4b22aa76-8d45-4388-a8de-fc36913df406.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127475,"Name":"Polar Rescue","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Journey to the icy waters beneath the North Pole.

Unfortunately firing a shot up the mother ship’s slim shaft is difficult, especially with sentry ships thrown in the mix, which a hit from them can send you careening across the screen.

Pressing Left or Right on the analog stick moves your rider across the road, while Up is used for acceleration. The face buttons allow you to change gears (Slow, Medium or Fast), pause the game (a rarity on the Vectrex!), as well as grab the occasional water bottle from the side of the road (required to maintain energy levels so you don't slow down). The gameplay involves avoiding the sides of the track, while dodging debris and fellow riders; failing to do any of these results in your rider crashing and losing precious seconds. What's impressive is that the tracks aren't flat, and instead feature rolling hills that even seem to affect how fast your bike can move while ascending. The action is fast but the biggest problem is that it's completely unplayable once you move into the highest gear; here, the action becomes a flickering mess and it's almost impossible to avoid the obstacles and opponents with any sense of precision. The trick is to cycle constantly between second and third gear, but even then you'll never be able to build up enough speed to place in the top two riders. There's also a very thin line between successfully grabbing the water bottle and crashing into the side of the road; as a result you'll never feel in full control, and instead find yourself bracing every time you try to obtain it. Annoyingly, following on from a crash opponents frequently run you over once you begin cycling which stops you in your tracks and sees more seconds tick off the clock. The Game 2 option features a slightly different layout and more debris on the road; while it's nothing too interesting it's nice that the developers added a bit more content.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhP6uBPe5SA","Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"GCE","Publisher":"GCE","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131634,"FileName":"382363a4-872f-4a2c-b1ec-a0ebedfb15ff.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":131634,"FileName":"d38081a8-df06-4868-a9d7-f0f863b6d040.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":131634,"FileName":"115ca0cc-0227-44d1-982b-51a27f800f0d.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":131634,"FileName":"7e841bdf-f7ee-4cd8-87b2-10d31f44e29d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":131634,"FileName":"3d9b2346-2fe3-4f7d-bfd3-ddebaa299650.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182474,"Name":"Vaboom!/Vectrace","ReleaseYear":"2000","Overview":"Also known as Ronen's Game Cart, Vaboom!/Vectrace is a bit of an unusual entry, as there aren't a lot of racing games for the system as it is, as far as Vectrace goes.

You control a triangle that can be rotated around a central hexagonal shape. The goal is to avoid touching further hexagons approaching the central hexagon from the borders of the screen for as long as possible. At least one of the sides of those approaching hexagons will be left open, so there is always room to escape. For distraction the whole game screen will constantly rotate around the center, occasionally changing the direction of rotation. Over time - to increase the difficulty - the shapes will start pulsating to the rhythm of the music, and the rotation speed will increase significantly when the soundtrack picks up a new theme.\n\nIn contrast to the original Hexagon this vector based version is more simplistic: It does not feature any solid or advanced forms, only hexagons. Like the original this version contains only one song which is changing over time to match the gameplay. The game features two difficulty settings (Easy, Hard).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQK5izu1Nd8","Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"SDW Developments","Publisher":"SDW Developments","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176608,"FileName":"330ae7a0-4119-47c6-846b-2e1772ae694b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176608,"FileName":"d36020f1-24f3-4fd9-b6a9-8867ba998129.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":176608,"FileName":"36e6e6c8-ec04-4daa-859e-47f92eed4190.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":176608,"FileName":"8e5e3a90-da1b-41da-b51e-d0a6ffda3cee.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176608,"FileName":"2b412b70-8b7b-4eb9-a7f9-b63b9c9d153e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":176608,"FileName":"cf00bbaf-0032-444d-acd1-331e08538f7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176607,"Name":"Vectrexians","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":"Vectrexians is a clone/variation of Galaxian developed and published in 1999 by Tutstronix.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq4yQdkhr5I","Platform":"GCE Vectrex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Tutstronix","Publisher":"Tutstronix","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176607,"FileName":"6eaf5d67-2856-412c-a06f-1f156a16706f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176607,"FileName":"afa3f4dd-2db9-4de8-ad2c-a4703d9921ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":176607,"FileName":"cbbd0379-3fbc-4733-9d05-4d0df2a9a7e4.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176607,"FileName":"920cab25-5870-4567-8029-301ada592d2d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176607,"FileName":"e60af4d2-5148-4e40-8e67-25f468df8546.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182482,"Name":"Verzerk","ReleaseYear":"2002","Overview":"Verzerk is a modified version of Berzerk, which adds speech to the game.

(from the All Good Things cartridge) to how incredibly fast the enemy ships swarm in and out of the center of the screen (the “wormhole”). At first this seems like Dondzila’s easiest game to date, since the ships can pass through you without harm and they don’t shoot back, but that won’t last for long (isn’t that always the way?). Making up for not having any of the cool music and the bonus stages, you’re granted three power-ups (rather than the arcade’s one) upon shooting special ships: double shots, destroying everything onscreen, and slowing down the action for several seconds.
