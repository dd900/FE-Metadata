{"Name":"Namco System 22","Games":[{"DatabaseID":182082,"Name":"Air Combat 22","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Air Combat 22 is the arcade sequel to the first Air Combat in the long running Ace Combat series. You pilot one of three planes, a F14 Tomcat, Su-27 or the F22 Raptor. The sequel comes with improved graphics and again uses semi-realistic physics. The objective is to destroy enemy planes using guns or missiles over a succession of sorties and missions. A radar shows the location of enemy planes in relation to your own and on-screen arrows point towards the nearest enemy. Each mission starts with a enemy counter that decreases as enemy planes are dispatched of. The enemy count has to be taken down to zero before a timer runs out, else it is game over. A bonus stage has the player landing on an aircraft carrier for points. Later missions involve air-to-air refuelling and attacking enemy aircraft carriers and bases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Namco System 22","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Namco Limited","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182082,"FileName":"471f8227-1677-4fce-b93d-802f39fcb8f0.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182082,"FileName":"73aed502-de45-46dc-a70f-b34357aabf0d.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182082,"FileName":"e377925a-3562-445d-9e60-f341e0ce35ab.png","Type":"Arcade - Control Panel","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182082,"FileName":"576b0ca3-5568-4cee-8a77-2d7f80b09a0e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182082,"FileName":"062e49de-1134-4547-a921-651098a00a26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182082,"FileName":"d56e37db-a84f-45de-af14-44101b1fd65d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182080,"Name":"Time Crisis","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"The events of the game take place in the fictional republic Sercia. A coup has ended the tyrannical regime of the Garo family, leading to the election of a new president. However, the last member of the once powerful Garo family kidnaps President MacPherson's daughter, demanding to know top military secrets in exchange for her life. An international intelligence service known as VSSE sends agent Richard Miller to infiltrate Garo's stronghold and rescue the young woman.\n\nTime Crisis is a rail shooter similar to Virtua Cop in gameplay style. The player moves automatically, using the light gun to eliminate appearing enemies, after which he can proceed to the next screen. The stages typically culminate in boss battles. The player can also press a button to make Richard dive for cover. However, using this feature too much might result in expiration of the time limit imposed on each screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Namco System 22","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Namco Limited","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"202428e3-f2ff-467a-a8b7-0de29255ae26.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"e5367995-1069-4cdb-93ca-6c0761b86c61.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"e8352d1c-a06b-419d-ba86-00470fc1dceb.png","Type":"Arcade - Control Panel","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"5112bfc3-1ae9-490f-b1c8-e334e0d66769.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"d1fe0046-37c7-4f85-a3b8-2fd6c0576e72.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"c3ade1bf-062b-4b58-9b06-f1fdae983feb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"8b875539-e7e5-42a8-a4c5-0bd4e706d495.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"ef54b6fc-4469-461b-adc0-729cb9c537a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182080,"FileName":"71442367-7555-4f4e-8d15-283b398ddd61.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
