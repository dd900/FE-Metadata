The game featured vastly superior graphics, utilizing the Sega Model 3 hardware. The majority of Daytona USA 2 cabinets were released as deluxe models (with far fewer Twin Cabinets), which could be linked together for up to 16 players using network multiplayer mode. A notable change from the original is the ability to select a car and corresponding driver, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of player experience. Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps, an Advanced course with 4 laps, and a long Expert course with 2 laps. The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an \"ending\" and see the game credits.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1998-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Gp-hMCUT9F0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daytona_USA_2"},"126166":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Daytona USA 2: Power Edition In The UK AUS & EU Dubbed Version"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega AM2","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"896b1f23-91f9-4315-926f-2f6fb2549655.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"0452c132-aacb-47b0-95e5-e644cb86a5d1.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"119f3dd0-435c-4d5a-9520-cd117039c10d.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"7af677ef-d109-4cc9-879e-771667180284.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"df439913-45c9-4f12-8f40-1007b72318aa.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"76237122-8795-4c8c-b3ab-b980b0271dad.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6ef6ea50-7a08-4135-848e-d04cbf877e3f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d20251ae-33fd-4bd0-b148-da0e7c3ea4ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"deefd0fd-b6f7-41e3-85ee-ffde9307ea48.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"711a01df-1dc8-47ac-b1d7-873d100dfbe8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fd7bedff-06f2-42f4-beee-1a3660de66ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a9720e65-83bf-45c4-8a4b-9a9ac5dd19f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Daytona USA 2: Power Edition","Overview":"In late 1998, a few months after the release of Battle on the Edge, Sega released an updated version, known as Daytona USA 2: Power Edition.

Also included is the \"Challenge\" course option, which combines the three courses altogether. Along with slightly revamped handling physics, the beginner car's livery is altered. Added to Power Edition is the Hornet Classic car, the player car from Daytona USA with an altered design. The opponent cars' AI is also more aggressive in this version, with another change being to one corner in the advanced course to balance out the difficulty. Before this change, many experts considered this corner the most difficult in the game.[citation needed] Unusual for an arcade game, there was also an official strategy guide released in Japan. This strategy guide featured developer interviews as well as comprehensive tips and hints compiled by a group of arcade driving game professionals known as Team Marubaku. The strategy guide has been out of print for a number of years and second-hand copies can command high prices.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseYear":1998,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daytona_USA_2#Power_Edition"},"126170":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega AM2","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"8997bdcf-1ed0-4d50-ab63-43b37464e2ff.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"bb3e80ff-e23e-4a2d-9df4-cf73975fdd08.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3a570943-d923-4fea-802f-5e3cb349c4ea.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"55652ac5-15b6-4f2f-9cfd-f8b4215332da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"0d60271a-d228-437e-9f38-8b2a0a0fa91d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"fcc8c627-00b7-484a-88ba-a3944555f94e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ff5b6596-5f08-4041-9f5d-9b2a132f6ce3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6a51f439-9153-47ec-bc4d-535cda36ca9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Emergency Call Ambulance","Overview":"Emergency Call Ambulance is an arcade game released in October of 1999 by Sega.
