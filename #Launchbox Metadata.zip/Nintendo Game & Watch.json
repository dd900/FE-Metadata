It is a vertical multi-screen single-player Game & Watch. It opens like a compact, with an upper and lower screen. The game was never released in Japan.\n\nUsing the D-pad to move John Solver, you must reach at least one of the bombs hidden in the walls to clear the screen and receive a bonus for the time remaining. The only obstacles in your path are the walls, which you must either manoeuvre around or push them along provided there is no obstruction in the way. Some levels are a test of speed; others are a test of logic and intelligence.\n\nGame A consists of a set sequence of maze layouts. These range from a maze requiring no wall-pushing to mazes where you must carefully choose which walls to move to reach the bombs. There is a constant 40-second time limit to each level. Every 10 levels you will enter a scrolling maze where you must avoid getting squashed by the advancing walls until you reach the bomb at the end.\nWhilst the generous time limit means you can rack up a very high score on this mode, the levels do get more and more devious and testing as you progress. This mode is for the logically minded player.\n\nGame B consists of a number of maze layouts, each level is chosen at random from the set. The levels are generally very straightforward and good players can complete each one in 2–4 seconds. The time limit begins at 40 seconds but steadily reduces as you progress, until you are left with just 4 seconds for each level. However, this mode is potentially never-ending, thus the highest scores are possible. However, as there is no pause button, there is no rest and your reactions will be tested. This mode is definitely for the quick-thinking player.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_s-Q0wsi34","Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Nintendo R&D1","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":142008,"FileName":"97c96b79-550f-4fff-a9d6-5f496b6a5026.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142008,"FileName":"167bdb5a-24a5-4e27-96b1-c4578bb5d9bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142008,"FileName":"ef0fcd12-2a1d-4995-9d33-e9e223fb636c.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142008,"FileName":"c21c6635-ea5f-4ef6-aa34-5986fd89fb78.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142008,"FileName":"6b03ebda-7871-4917-9814-a39924df9154.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":142008,"AlternateName":"Game & Watch: Bomb Sweeper","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":142012,"Name":"Boxing","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Boxing is a Micro VS.

It is also the origin of Mr. Game & Watch's standard B Button move in the Super Smash Bros. series. As the game progresses, the food will move faster. In Game A, the player must flip three pieces of food. In Game B, the player must flip four pieces of food. At 200 and 500 points, any misses the player has will be erased.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LR7HP6wV0I","Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1981-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"b566bb9e-a193-4599-8ad9-96e1814d4e23.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"fe338737-7043-4f80-9c35-d60d5775547d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"c49da1a3-74f0-421d-9cd5-086c37f2663d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"a72ac549-9901-45ed-b195-a3cb9edd6b56.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"e65ffa58-5085-4021-8271-3ad1f6336525.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"21da925c-d33e-4205-9d8f-39717bbb5fac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"4389922c-c5b4-42e4-bb1a-c8b6aece1321.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"b5ca1b06-6702-4f80-93c1-52769f0bccad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"902e0251-e238-4708-90b0-7fb0898e80b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"8ec7d6e1-8c1f-4f7f-9035-0b322761a396.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"6a2045de-b65a-40b9-b594-64c5391d822b.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"810d6f77-6f02-4384-ba68-ee56c68c4075.JPG","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"6789d4b6-be45-4cf0-b419-c12810e18b48.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"bf395d48-5359-49e6-b634-b71727911407.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"6ef21b01-bd24-477c-93c0-7139b0931043.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162004,"FileName":"1da6d93d-c93b-49df-bdde-f18214210515.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":162004,"AlternateName":"Game & Watch: Chef","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":147715,"Name":"Chicky Woggy","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"This is the Italian release by Polistil.

Every time the player hits a torch or an attacker, they receive two points. As the game progresses, the player will have to be a lot more cautious as more attackers appear. If an attacker manages to set the base on fire, the player will get a miss. If the player reaches 200 or 500 points without any misses, every torch or attacker the player hits will be worth five points for 30 to 50 seconds. If the player has any misses at either score, all misses will be removed instead. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over. In Game A, attackers come from three directions, but they change positions and come from different directions after a miss is made. In Game B, attackers come from four directions, and the game gets faster sooner.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6jsCdHxUDA","Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1982-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":162006,"FileName":"c780491e-5a82-473f-bb85-100c1dd35088.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162006,"FileName":"25d302e2-876b-482e-87c3-d947bb609390.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162006,"FileName":"6c11a70f-584c-4d85-8d9c-e24fd09c453e.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162006,"FileName":"1e02e50c-1c8a-48b1-950e-fd88cac5a7e8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162006,"FileName":"93fd1c95-7e36-4583-9459-8e0561c7b7c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162006,"FileName":"06938acd-d092-49d8-a67f-17182cab44ff.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":162006,"AlternateName":"Game & Watch: Fire Attack","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":164264,"Name":"Firefox F-7","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"This Grandstand games console was introduced in 1983.

The object of the game is to move boxes of bottles through the machine without dropping any. Each brother can climb a ladder to one of three positions. Mario receives a box at the bottom right, and must be in his lowest position to move it into the bottling machine. The box moves left through the machine, to Luigi, who must be in his lowest position to move it to the next level, which moves it to the right, to Mario's middle position, who raises it to the next level. The box moves to Luigi's middle position, then to Mario's highest position, and finally to Luigi's highest position, where Luigi throws the box onto a truck. When the truck is full, the Brothers have a short break, before getting back to work. Successfully moving a box up one level earns the player 1 point, and loading the truck with eight boxes earns 10 points, for a total of 58 points for all the boxes in the truck. However, if a Brother isn't there to catch a box, it falls to the floor and breaks, angering the Brothers' supervisor, resulting in a miss.

Mario earns a point each time he empties a load of cement from the upper hopper and two points each time he empties a load from the lower hopper. Each container can hold only three loads of cement. Allowing the containers to overflow causes cement to spill down onto the workers, hurting them and giving Mario one miss. Falling off an elevator platform also earns a miss, as well as touching the very top of the screen and getting crushed by an elevator platform, or touching the very bottom and getting shocked by the floor of the elevator. In all versions of the game, there is an area on the lowermost portion of the elevator that Mario can use to save himself from touching the very bottom and getting shocked. On the Table Top version, there is a similar area on the uppermost portion of the elevator. This does not appear on any other version of the game. If Mario gets 300 points without any misses, the points will be worth double until he does get a miss. If he has any misses at said score, all misses will be cleared instead.

The model number for the Tabletop version of Mario's Cement Factory has caused some confusion, though it was revealed later than in a German magazine, an image of the game was shown and the logo read \"Concrete Mixer\", suggesting that the game was initially going to be called that, and explaining the model number. \n\nIn the game, you'll control Mario who'll pull levers to make sure that the cement goes into the mixers.  In the game, you control a character in a cement factory. You start at the upper left hand corner of the screen. In the middle, platforms are dropping down on the left side and going up on the right side. Meanwhile, buckets of cement are about to go in the mixers, though there are machines blocking the cement so that they can't go all of the way down. As the player, you have to make sure that the machines don't overflow with cement, and use the lever to make the cement drop the machine below. After you pull the other lever, then the cement will go into the mixer. There are four machines, two on each side. If you fall into the middle without a platform there to support you, then you will lose a life. If the machine fills up with too much cement, then you will also lose a life. \n\nFor the New Wide Screen version, Nintendo produced an estimated 750,000 copies of the game. The amount that they made for the Tabletop version is unknown. \n\n A Mini classics version of the game was released in 1998 which had a keychain connected to it. The game was included as a game in Game Boy Gallery for the Game Boy, and Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance. The game was also reissued as a Nintendo Mini Classics title.\nGameplay","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1983-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":169593,"FileName":"d3a31084-f6f4-4f98-ad97-a6a0b9b6945a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":169593,"FileName":"4192bf8b-fe4c-4377-87b1-871e1f799a4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":169593,"FileName":"22e90bb4-6ac6-478d-9961-0901bb351360.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":169593,"FileName":"e2f64f60-bb5f-4d33-9cda-c79873527f83.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":169593,"FileName":"604dce60-4f2c-4e23-a304-d6946d0a00ec.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":169593,"FileName":"a544212a-3b83-4dfd-99f7-3f0160aef321.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":169593,"AlternateName":"Game & Watch: Mario's Cement Factory (Table Top)","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":190490,"Name":"Match Number","ReleaseYear":"1979","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"A-One LSI","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190490,"FileName":"80729703-391e-4cb5-a999-998ad897b108.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190490,"FileName":"ad516520-9534-4ac6-90ac-c5dafa64cfb1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190490,"FileName":"585db4d8-a81a-46ba-a124-e30c299840b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":190490,"AlternateName":"matchnum","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190413,"Name":"MC Hammer: U Can't Touch This","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"MC Hammer: U Can't Touch This is a handheld LCD electronic video game developed by Tiger Electronics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Tiger Electronics","Publisher":"Tiger Electronics, Ltd","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190413,"FileName":"34cb3354-d77d-4ff2-a366-7e39d6991f13.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190413,"FileName":"a6301d9b-8fd3-4cee-8f1f-1d00635f67af.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190413,"FileName":"230b67fe-685c-4f02-9dc8-c24fe850b999.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":190413,"AlternateName":"tmchammer","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":169660,"Name":"Merry Cook","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Merry Cook (MG-04) is a Soviet clone of Nintendo's Game & Watch Wide Screen: Chef.\n\nThe player controls a chef juggling around the food so that nothing touches the floor.

A version of the game was released as a keychain title under the miniclassics label. The control button leaflet, which was only present in this game's box and Fire Attack's, showcases various characters from the Peanuts franchise.

The player earns a point for erasing a green block, two points for a blue block, and three points for a red block. When the player clears a display, they will earn five points for every unit remaining on the bonus meter. The next display will contain more blocks, with the maximum being 18. If the player erases all but the red blocks and then hits all the red blocks once to make them flash, the player will be awarded 30 points. Eventually, blocks that require two hits to break will appear, as well as unbreakable barriers that get in the player's way. If a ball falls to the bottom, the player receives a miss. At 300 points, any misses the player has will be removed. The player receives a Game Over when they have three misses.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1984-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"df8d7227-51b8-40d6-9f50-e96ae987a487.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"2b2851a2-fc4f-423c-80e4-1539cd7205eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"f2230553-09ca-4125-8501-64b2f9d1b589.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"61a9aae0-6cb7-4dba-b073-9d58b4acf038.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"5cac3fd5-a8b8-4f88-9cb4-db302afb77b1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"cd459ed1-e81b-405e-bbef-0a47e42c1dbc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"99a592f6-1500-44f3-8d73-fadf8a330625.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162014,"FileName":"c06e3534-dfc1-4b8d-a04d-ba8ed0cc960a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":162014,"AlternateName":"Game & Watch: Spitball Sparky","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":164118,"Name":"Squish","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Squish is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Multi Screen series on April 17, 1986.

Its gameplay was heavily inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System game Zelda II: Adventure of Link, and it featured an original story described on the manual. \n\nUnlike the other LCD games, this was made by Nintendo and appeared on a Nintendo platform. The handheld console would be Nintendo's penultimate release before the release of the Game Boy (the last being Mario The Juggler). \n\nGameplay:\n\nPlayers control Link and fight through labyrinth chambers on the Game & Watch's lower screen. In the labyrinth chambers, Link faces Poe-like Ghosts, up to four Stalfoses, and a Moblin-like Goblin mini-boss. Stalfoses and Ghosts cannot be defeated and must be dodged and blocked with the shield respectively. The Goblin must be killed in order to complete the lower-screen labyrinth.[5] Once the Labyrinth is complete, stairs appear and the action shifts to the Dragon's Lair in the upper screen. Here Link battles a dragon on the right hand side of the screen while avoiding its fire and tail attacks. The left hand side of the screen displays the dungeon map and items such as the Tomahawk item—unique to this game—that Link gains while fighting the dragon. Upon defeating the dragon, the game starts again with quicker enemies and retaining the player's high score. This Game & Watch game also features a continue button that allows players to continue the game in the event of the player's death.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game & Watch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo R&D1","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"c9740df3-6413-442d-aa56-89c0a58d8dec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"a786797f-ef5d-4218-94d2-753a1b5de98a.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"e0e2917f-8f4b-4c63-9ac8-fe13623dd229.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"05467376-3932-46c7-a4e4-b5823b3c44f8.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"a2c32e4d-5312-4dad-ac8e-cbcd385790c9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"b1318f39-181a-4a81-810c-ce7fb7ca5690.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164290,"FileName":"9b8fb091-0b71-424f-9bc5-35b3edea5151.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164290,"AlternateName":"Game & Watch: Zelda","Region":"World"}]}]}
