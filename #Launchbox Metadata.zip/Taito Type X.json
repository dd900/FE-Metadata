The blue Laser concept is more like a beam, instead of the ones seen in prior installments.","Publisher":"Moss","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"102381":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Raiden IV NESICAxLive"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Moss","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8fa1b336-0f8e-46a9-9769-7aa8a7ebd328.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9948a5d2-e764-42aa-b8eb-18d40f6237fd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"f0c5cfee-7745-4fe4-8c0d-f5de788d7ec7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"e6c0fd3a-bf51-4180-b051-9ecab305e70f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"141eb335-69c8-4b41-894d-96c1efd2a959.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"db4f73b2-2c11-46a5-b703-062e78d43ee7.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"03f7637b-cb85-4400-904b-79e056580d1d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"975c2049-22d3-485c-b433-a6d413f4db12.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2f7d1e9b-d9b6-4099-82b5-038fe5df376a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a2471325-210c-406c-b975-e49f49cb41d1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Raiden IV","Overview":"Raiden IV is a vertical scrolling shooting video game developed by MOSS that was first released for the arcades in Japan in 2007.

Before major bosses and between levels there are cutscenes with dialogue featuring the character(s) in play. The dialogue is unique for each different pair of characters selected, resulting in, according to the publisher, 55 different scenarios. Each character has a primary standard attack, which is generally forward-shooting bullets. This is activated by tapping the fire button or by pressing auto-fire button. The secondary attack is known as a shikigami, activated by holding the fire button, or pressing a dedicated button on consoles. This attack is often more powerful, but slows or stops the character completely. Each character's shikigami is unique and also comes in two variants that are chosen at the start of the game. Finally, characters have a limited supply of bombs, their effects also unique to each character.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2006-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"102509":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Spica Adventure NESICAxLive"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"bab407ea-2451-4fa0-84f4-2b2dd0ead197.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0b254f16-d549-41c4-824f-69880b7871fb.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6449efbc-3a44-4769-9f07-626b5b4d69f9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"204e9c3d-abf0-4981-8f9b-343def26165d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"203b07e0-5289-4410-b777-249ad5cd984a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cd756cc3-a46c-4456-b6f0-4fca10503318.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3b6c7b04-5be3-4640-92b3-8c133e008903.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ddaa1b30-0fbf-4d09-bdba-198032be4947.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b14ff068-7869-4cb4-9408-3272472b33d7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spica Adventure","Overview":"Spica Adventure is an Arcade game from Taito.

Since then, SNK Playmore has collected, with much affection, suggestions and complaints from the fans about the game. From the PS3 release through April 2012, the company has been launching frequent updates based on their research to improve the game and make the title experience more accurate to the public's expectations. New characters have been added, the company has better balanced the game, removed some infinite combos that should not exist, among other improvements.\n\n\n\nAnyway, SNK Playmore, with a lot of sweat, had managed to finish the job, The King of Fighters XIII had stayed exactly as the gamers wanted. However, there was an issue that troubled the company. Originally the game was released for Arcade, and only after a time ported to the PS3. With the updates made, it was noted that the home version had gotten much better than the original version, making KOFXIII outdated in Arcade.\n\n\n\nThinking about it, the company decided to do the reverse. If Arcade had given life to the game's home port, The King of Fighters XIII had to go back to Arcade and showcase all of its improvements, bringing back the glory of the franchise.\n\n\n\nWith this premise is born The King of Fighters XIII Climax, made available a few days ago in Japan, bringing everything the version for PlayStation 3 has. Unfortunately, SNK distributor Atlus in the west has not revealed whether there are plans for the launch of KOFXIII Climax in the Arcades here.","Publisher":"SNK Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2012-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=28slD64O-gI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_King_of_Fighters_XIII#Climax"},"122863":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike NESICAxLive"},{"Name":"Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"9dfe5e89-a183-4d1c-8940-f327c82bb1c9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"481c7299-72b8-49c2-8067-b00f3f1b868b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"13b2701c-e941-4e19-8b89-0a5deda0d673.png","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information"},{"FileName":"712f0bb1-95b6-45f2-a9d1-0b880ac081d0.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"77025852-0e43-4cc9-8a04-2ca4a8992347.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5d8efd3a-6091-4c6c-b4bc-470fdb488f27.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1d4afd1b-d243-40c7-b8af-5c08e2555420.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d03e6ad-2f66-4327-96ae-3d66a2e7c153.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0030e4bb-7dcf-4c78-aba4-873f5deb7d9d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"79a9f062-28e2-49b8-9c61-3627f0f11837.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bcc2b2d7-3864-4c79-8554-1e1e5e8da865.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"61f50a84-9c5d-4588-a65d-6b791428ac16.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"84b5f53b-8485-41b9-8a1a-17524599d135.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5eaea605-fed3-4f1c-8a7d-94b8af3ef55f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"920fee87-940c-4fdc-81d4-d495d0c66cc5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"1c3f2789-0a19-4f1d-b026-4fdc8787712d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"def5f3f1-c5d2-48f8-a605-2843bdf3c032.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"618ac663-87c9-4177-9af3-c45a9be58a85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"55ab03bc-fa26-4c47-a969-e2492588bf12.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fed96852-c7b0-4c05-aa7c-5999466b06b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike","Overview":"Some time ago, we reported that Capcom would be bringing some of its classic games back to arcades via Taito’s NESiCAxLive network.

While characters are able to perform attacks on their own, they are also able to call their Personas to assist them during battles. Should the Persona be attacked by the opponent, the player will lose a blue card situated below the health bar. Following four attacks, the player will be unable to use Persona for a short time. Some attacks can also have status elements such as poison in which the opponent suffers damage over time.\n\nThrough button combinations, characters are able to perform a series of special attacks as well as defend themselves for a prolonged time. The strongest attack is the \"Instant Kill\" which can immediately defeat the opponent if the attack connects. However, these types of techniques are limited as a result of using the \"SP Gauge\" which is at the bottom of the screen in the form of blue bars. When the character has low life left, they enter into the \"Awakening State\" that refills the SP Gauge and increases the character's defense. Below the life bar there is the Burst Gauge which gives access to other forms of the Persona Attacks as well as refil the SP Gauge depending on how it is used.\n\nThe console versions also feature a story mode and an online mode, with the former giving multiple campaigns that focus on a single character. When first starting the game, only four character campaigns are available, requiring the player to complete to unlock more. Across the story, the player is given the option of choosing answers for questions which can result in a different ending from the regular one.","Publisher":"Atlus Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i5o-zohN9nY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Persona_4_Arena"},"127548":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"8fcf9d7e-9b52-40c5-83f0-8ac01f8b05ab.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"8d8de3b9-e35f-487f-a3f8-aef2577e9ef6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"0acb40da-586a-4bf0-ae18-1a6da0d07a85.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ccff4155-3ac4-4ee1-a94e-b807efbd9f16.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c089d9d7-2dbc-4da4-a614-8e731857a6ab.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bcda977f-f517-4d7b-b10b-f10d74804a35.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c154830d-2af5-4b37-abf9-a8fc25e741c1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"386a2445-9935-49a0-94eb-d0a66cbffcf4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma","Overview":"Besides normal rebalancing from Continuum Shift Extend, Chrono Phantasma features several revamped gameplay mechanics and introduces seven new characters to the roster (with two additional characters added to the Extend version of Chrono Phantasma).

It dishes large damage, but immediately ends Overdrive; and Active Flow, which acts as the opposite of Negative Penalty status. A character that fights offensively goes into an Active Flow, which boosts damage and recovery of the Burst Gauge. Active Flow also increases the damage of Exceed Accel (for some it may add extra effects and animations). When a character enters Active Flow, his\/her emblem on the health bar becomes purple pink.

This is where Homura steps in and gets the privilege of representing such an uncommon diaspora of gaming. Developed by Skonec, known for their contributions in the genre with Psyvariar 2, the game seems to mesh elements that feel right at home for many players while still managing to have its own identity in many respects. It was released in 2005 for the arcade, later followed by a PlayStation 2 port.\n\nFrankly, the story has never been of importance in such a frantic genre where your only objective is to shoot everything in sight and survive as long as possible. It does though, more often than not, offer imaginative art styles and designs with settings that can be quite memorable. Homura (which roughly translates to \"flame\" or \"blaze\") sits right in the middle of it all. Set in a fictional timeline during the Japanese Edo period, the story revolves around a forbidden Heaven's jewel which came to Ieyasu Tokugawa's possession, granting him many powers, resulting in the invasion of Osaka Castle, and opening his path for ruling the kingdoms. Of course, no one is going to let him have it his way, so members of different families unite to oppose him. Their only hope is Homura, the powerful half-human being, who is not affected by the jewel due to his bloodline, and is the only one capable of defeating the demonic army of Tokugawa.","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2005,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PwHzLXjxePc"},"127557":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK Playmore","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"8e0eac1e-b0f0-4318-8e58-c0127da122d3.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"28f091c4-5c88-4507-8052-f71e4bdce4eb.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"a5822241-4bfa-41a9-afc0-c678f63c8f9b.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f0a0e770-b299-4576-9bb7-95faa1236b59.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6e6c9908-972e-4503-9ca6-8f5c1934680c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f3370e26-4ccc-4c16-9b92-25193820f83f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"494e9559-7463-4da6-a31d-fa22453a5efd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match Final Edition","Overview":"After “KOF '98”, often praised by the fans as the best installment in the “KOF” series, and “KOF ’98 UM” 10 years later, “KOF ’98” returns now in an ultimate and final version with King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match Final Edition.","Publisher":"SNK Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_King_of_Fighters_%2798"},"127601":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Dariusburst Another Chronicle"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Pyramid","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"96e8954c-de4c-46ec-b6a1-81bd0d18c14f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e6e46baf-4a79-437f-b3aa-545424dff44e.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"cb563a47-bbc2-4639-ab2c-9fac53a9d3e2.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bfcdbd12-b7bf-4d05-b994-3ef6a9b2ee04.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"110278ba-6e0e-4b3f-a1e1-aee305deab29.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1dadb3ca-94e9-42ed-aa2e-040a9ea1f587.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f29a5109-c9d6-4764-9608-5d16891c7bc8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"26a1aa6f-9703-478d-9cb8-0eb9b162795a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Dariusburst: Another Chronicle","Overview":"1904 D.C.

The game can be described as a fighter\/shmup mashup, with elements of 2D fighters mixed with modern top-down shooters. It is very similar to Psychic Force, a unique, heavily projectile-based fighting game developed at Taito while G.rev's founders worked there. Unlike Psychic Force, however, it offers even more elaborate firing patterns that conjure a danmaku shooter aesthetic. This is further reinforced by \"B.O.S.S. Mode,\" a super attack that allows players to transform into screen-filling boss ships that can fill the screen with bullets. It may also be likened to \"a 2D version of Virtual On\" mixed with shmup boss encounters and modern danmaku patterns. Due to its close ties with Virtual On's mechanics, several of its strategies can also be applied to this game as well.\nEach character in Senko no Ronde boasts unique weapons, bullet patterns, and game play styles, each have two variations called Cartridge A and Cartridge B which have slightly modified stats and weapon properties. All characters have a main weapon and sub weapon, as well as 3-4 special attacks called \"Barrages\", which are activated via command inputs similar to 2D fighters. When matches start players are given two \"B.O.S.S. Stock\" which lets a player switch to a larger robot called \"B.O.S.S. Mode\", which is comparable to a boss ship in standard shmups. In Boss Mode a player has increased firepower and will regain a portion of health, but movement is more restricted, only one boss form can be activated at a time. Upon losing a match you will regain one Boss Stock. If your character's health bar is depleted they will enter a special state called \"Vanish Mode\" which reduces the size of the characters hitbox, but if one more shot connects you will lose the round. Using a Boss Stock well in Vanish Mode will result in using a more powerful Boss Mode, called \"Final Boss\" Mode, which has benefits such as additional firepower or more mobility. Final Boss mode also has access to an extra powerful super attack.","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2011,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WarTech:_Senko_no_Ronde"},"128207":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"G.rev Ltd.","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"6045be77-7b7c-43cd-a76f-fee3be858e65.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d6fb9c56-4428-41be-aff7-ae526ed9e6de.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"49b1da38-d15d-41a5-95c6-3173a47a16ee.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"59df378e-f832-4b15-b957-9fb68cdf0113.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"182b4bb4-11ba-41d2-9a75-ebe5298aac12.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"bcd96e1f-8570-49ec-aaf0-4d00dab4ab41.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"49eed0be-23d4-425a-bbdf-a47cb4914989.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Strania: The Stella Machina","Overview":"Japanese boutique game studio G.rev Classic\n\nThis throwback robot shoot’em up is an ode to the nostalgia of 1980s arcade games.

The player uses a team of monsters and solves a tile-matching puzzle to determine how powerful their monsters' attacks are, and can activate their monsters' active skills during play for various effects and choose one monster to serve as team leader to use the passive leader skill. However, several changes were made to suit the arcade version, which uses the NESiCA smart card to save playing data for individual players. The puzzle is now on an 8-by-5 grid, allowing for greater movement and combos. The player's team of monsters consists only of their leader monster, three sub members, and a friend monster, however the player can also choose three reserve monsters that they can switch into play. Players choose avatars to play through the game's story mode as well as its online mode to play against other players in real time, and these avatars have their own active skills that can be used during play. Monsters' HP is not pooled, and individual monsters can be temporarily knocked out of play if they lose all HP.

The series of Darius games prior to Burst have been groundbreaking in their multiscreen setups and Another Chronicle EX continues this tradition with two 32-inch LCD screens placed seamlessly next to eachother.\n\nThe game is an off-beat, sci-fi shoot 'em up set in outer space with aquatic-themed (typically fish-shaped) robotic enemies. In keeping with tradition, the game also features branching paths instead of the linear progression found in most video games.\n\n• Four players can team up to fight back against the robotic hordes! The shared power-up system means no worries about one player hogging all the glory.\n• \"Body sonic\" booming sound system that makes use of two subwoofers so you feel each explosion.\n• Soundtrack produced by the famous ZUNTATA\n• Two headphone jacks so you minimize other sound from the arcade around you\n• Choose from eight different ships, each with unique abilities\n• Infinite Ship Entry - play through the game with unlimited lives for an extra price.
