It marks the start of Sega's Dinosaur King franchise, and was the first game to be released for Aurora hardware (Naomi Based). Every time the game is played, a slot near the base will dispense a random card, either dinosaur or move cards. These cards are different from their TCG equivalents. They are laid out a lot differently and have a barcode running down one side. To use these cards in game, one must swipe a dinosaur card of their choosing on the scanner between the two control pads when prompted. They can also swipe up to three move cards as upgrade moves for the moves that are preset, although to use three move cards they must be rock, paper and scissors.\n\nThere are two types of moves: normal moves and super moves. Normal moves can be used by any dinosaur and do not have an attribute. Super moves are powerful moves that can only be used by dinosaurs of matching attributes. There are six attributes: fire, water, grass, earth, lightning and wind. Each dinosaur has their own attribute; water types for example are usually large sauropods and rarth types are usually heavilly armoured quadrepedal dinosaurs such as Edmontia and Stegosaurus. Move cards have their own hand sign: rock, paper or scissors.\n\nDinosaurs also have a critical move, a powered up move that is stronger than the rest. Critical moves are easily distinguishable by the spike patterns around the hand sign. After all cards have been swiped, the game begins. One can choose to play through the storyline in one player or battle another player.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2005,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jxU07tC5JVQ"},"36391":{"Cooperative":"false","DOS":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Name":"Dinosaur King - D-Team VS. the Alpha Fortress","ReleaseYear":2008},"36415":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"G.Rev","DOS":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"39c8c62c-9039-4cec-bd0b-9c26d5454198.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"8052aead-5877-44e5-9e74-09800d63d5a2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e0c61ccf-e1eb-4c53-a12d-89bb704a3464.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"db3d3544-4a23-4b89-8daa-76c200a1a1bc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c5ce65d0-6f3e-4614-adcb-d73d61616f1c.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4bb6d46c-49b3-4afd-bc86-7c85f4da6a01.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"6040fe61-6639-4560-8846-7c5fbc59e8ba.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c74364d4-af8a-4b64-aa39-be2ae90d2597.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker","Overview":"Idol Star Seeker is a minesweeper-style arcade game played on a field of hexagonal tiles.

The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.\n\nAs most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called \"buzzing\" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again.\n\nAs in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen.

Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.\n\nGuilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game.

The default type is a typical sit down cabinet with one monitor, while the \"DX type\" cabinet features three side-by-side 29\" monitors, which surround the player to create a \"cockpit\".\n\nThe extreme difficulty of \"Airline Pilots\", combined with a lack of interest in realistic flight simulators, led Sega to manufacture a conversion kit which allowed owners to convert the units into the more popular Sega Strike Fighter. As a result, Airline Pilots cabinets are relatively rare.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseType":"Released"},"152411":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dynamite Deka EX","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Sega","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"aa07d8a8-5a97-44f7-aa89-755e833775ff.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0c001b07-3558-4750-8be6-d3ca36071e6b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"bdfe66a6-8df8-49c8-bfe2-1fb958625507.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"091019bd-f523-4511-b776-6e245150fe7a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Circuit Board"},{"FileName":"8e8a2368-ae0a-4a23-9130-f89464756236.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b4778279-c762-47a4-9f24-32e63bcdabf2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4ac5726a-c74c-4889-9141-738cd61c4a11.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"72206ffb-61e6-490a-a913-7f9e83982914.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f1fbd116-c56f-43fd-826b-c61ccdceeff6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Asian Dynamite","Overview":"Asian Dynamite is a Sega NAOMI arcade beat-'em-up game.

It debuted in arcades in 1999. The enhanced Millennium edition released in 2000 includes several enhancements.  \n\nThe gameplay of Dead or Alive 2, and all subsequent DOA fighting games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter.\n\nIn DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds. The other defining feature of the game, aside from blows\/throws\/holds, is its stun system. Many attacks can inflict a stun on the opponent; those stunned cannot attack or guard, however they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed.\n\nA major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled.\n\nIn DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out.\n\nOther notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage (the first game to implement this feature was SNK's Samurai Shodown 64), and upon completing the game, presenting the player with (sometimes ambiguous) endings for each character using the game's standard engine.","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lJZVa-GW2mU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dead_or_Alive_2"},"152431":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hitmaker","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"90c6866b-2c2f-4865-8837-7737ee4f3870.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"b0fbe496-0a48-47f8-9d5b-16a4dcfd9fc8.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a54ee261-0ddf-4ae8-aedf-efddaf88fb76.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"be505e20-2b50-406d-ab94-528b2c04e7da.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"983f98c7-2129-4ae1-9558-bafdaddffe2f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"3607a9ba-de12-4719-86ce-0aa0cd20adc5.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"07c6299e-693b-4e99-8e24-1db712a02401.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Control Panel"},{"FileName":"2d2533bb-08a4-4dd6-8643-84019be8fe49.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"83e8736a-b283-464f-90c8-fc96c786518c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2577ffb3-a409-402a-ab90-a97260ce9012.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"41906da0-65aa-41e7-b8f2-8f9cf67c78d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f5f7d510-bab7-469c-8252-cf6ce4745e60.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9116dba1-2096-44bf-9f00-a775530886de.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bb11e707-9205-462e-b849-46730f973fd7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1270c027-ab31-4d30-a78e-f11c860649a9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3b2df46e-5895-4fdb-be74-ef5014abb52e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crazy Taxi","Overview":"Crazy Taxi is an arcade racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time.

Refusing to share their technique with the rest of the world, Igem eventually developed a weather control machine named ONI, which they intend to use for the purpose of global domination. A squadron of ace helicopter pilots, called Zero Gunner, is assembled to destroy ONI - but Igem fights back with everything they've got...\n\nZero Gunner 2 is a top-down shooter. All backdrops and vehicles in this game are modeled in 3D, though the gameplay mostly follows the conventions of 2D shooters. Since your craft is a helicopter, a \"target and spin\" feature has been added, whereby you can both rotate your craft to attack an enemy more efficiently, or alternatively lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. These actions are not automatically executed, and are controlled by the player; in order to succeed, mastering this feature is imperative.\n\nThe usual power-ups and boss enemy battles are included in the game, along with a selection of helicopters to choose from.\n\nZero Gunner 2 was developed by Psikyo as a sequel to Zero Gunner.","Publisher":"Psikyo","ReleaseDate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wX_Eq9VFjfE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zero_Gunner_2"},"152449":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"8bad013c-d0d1-41b8-9b20-0b5321d69797.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"03956edc-8862-497d-b2f4-61c5d0cdac63.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"f14b7776-31b8-4599-a7e1-d912fb277e68.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information"},{"FileName":"71ccf82b-5b35-497e-89ef-4ed3a1362913.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information"},{"FileName":"7b1fbc92-c4f0-4841-b308-2dcf8b50cf73.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information"},{"FileName":"f4355578-1bd9-4771-a8c0-de0f2b192dbc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"5a25a0e4-4445-4d0f-86f0-c7a608b064b7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7c845c62-9d0e-43da-9e31-13bdd006d6bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"87bb307b-8907-4309-86da-65e9ab10bef6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b978eaa7-82e3-4547-8ee4-cbd5678bb289.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d67eb6be-b311-4982-824e-69f7f738f45e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2cf8bc5-b6be-4be8-bc10-7a3aa9fb00a1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"845fd373-99c7-4d3b-b270-6b51806bbcd3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"99c1d4b6-c0f5-48f8-bd3e-b100bf143814.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"264d5754-306b-423c-95bd-1c9933c72615.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2b4e9224-88a9-4e6f-9b03-b01432053fb0.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cc2bd71d-1d9a-43dc-8096-5eef2f528fda.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"250a2d38-18c3-4af5-adc7-037572b67061.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e5227383-f58b-4539-b75a-bf8fd15a1342.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e99b7e9a-47c0-441f-aa8b-7d74189c1d3b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"711ac04b-20f6-4921-8e9a-0104d895c01e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0d2ae21e-0d6c-4a63-8cb2-c85098237d6a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"805a990a-f9e4-4183-b157-71aafefe256d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d4d88ab7-7403-408b-90a6-36b54635c4ac.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0339e052-ac0a-4cf6-abb6-b6ff4bc9ac71.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"008ce19b-69a2-4b0e-a24b-76334b66ec21.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4501843a-9b59-4bdd-81f2-16c109ae50e1.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e06aae57-dee8-44fd-81c2-512890cab85f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"aec3ad10-f3db-4699-b170-b2ff81992fe6.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"005c5917-d071-45ba-acb0-8d0f84143dcf.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c72dd3cd-357f-4fd2-8d35-cccd711dc07c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a69a6da8-3f74-43ca-be26-98e7b58b5d6a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e9854917-d8f1-4291-b6f9-09e7b596c17a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8efb9194-66b3-4132-8476-cd17b2b97769.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0a0634da-59cf-4d1c-add4-8c45afa4a8cc.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3850d53a-962c-4579-b002-2796eb92880f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"096a38bb-2bd4-48d7-a81a-f0a0c8627e93.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"abe7ed89-dd00-46fe-8710-fab23477b7d2.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bb19cbc2-1f0a-4982-b673-a9b53935953e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3ac73fa7-e310-4889-b9c0-3e07fa82559d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5a79c8f1-4e7a-4521-a8bf-3a05919e8a6f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"183d78b8-ca12-451b-8548-77a7eed341f1.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9e91c9df-e01d-4a7b-ba81-9442e6b1dc45.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes","Overview":"Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes is a crossover fighting game developed and published by Capcom.

The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2000,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cB3JWTIakbk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Justice"},"152455":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ecole","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"a53f3ca6-e8fd-40c5-b53e-22d2b4ec8734.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f11e6118-cb38-457a-9a54-cc993b7774d9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d75bb041-93d5-467c-b4f1-0b2da35e7f1e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"5710dcca-82c5-4c77-a7ae-4281f341e177.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"56e8d6cc-0968-42ae-a61c-d314fa5d4176.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c4af3136-6bc7-4161-855f-90da59ca2c97.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1d2bec3e-7c8a-486c-ac2d-f7337f49348c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7f87dcbc-84bf-4f92-abb0-ee149be62ad4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Melty Blood Actress Again Version A","Overview":"Melty Blood: Actress Again, is the third game in the Melty Blood fighting game series.

One legend above all is sought after by many, a treasure which can make any dream come true. Believers from all over the world set out to search for this treasure, and are forced to fight against one another in pursuit of the legendary Power Stone.\n\nGameplay involves selecting a character and then proceeding to battle the other characters, one at a time, in various locales. The three-dimensional fighting includes the ability to use special attacks as well as to pick up and fight with such objects as tables, chairs, rocks and bombs. During battle, \"Power Stones\", resembling gems of different colors, appear in the arena. If a character collects three Power Stones, he\/she transforms into a more powerful version of himself\/herself. He\/she will then be able to use one of two super special attacks: generally a massive long-range power attack and a grab or close-range move. The powered-up mode only lasts until the power bar is fully drained, during which the special attack can be executed (which completely depletes the power bar) or other, lesser special moves can be executed (which only use a small portion of power). Each match continues until the life bar of one of the two characters fighting is depleted.","Publisher":"CAPCOM Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1999-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qunlrEEXhHA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Power_Stone"},"152475":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"G.Rev","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"05261d36-cb5b-4f5d-a36b-b22aff9212df.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"4aa5971e-70fd-43e9-b896-eada1064c6ea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"31832ed5-8711-4155-8ef9-e8617151e59c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dec6cbc0-9e1a-46f6-a70c-08150ccc4c25.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"72bf312d-f599-4597-8c5b-5db7e334b0e2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3e299b09-3778-474e-9bb9-833fcfad6569.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"28d84712-9fe9-4cba-9724-2defc64cc68c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"bb83cb98-f887-4a38-8453-5e7637f1440c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"140fbeb8-dc15-490b-b9de-22dd48062dc0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c6290058-1134-4ecb-bd94-6386cd8fb400.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Senko No Ronde Special","Publisher":"G.Rev","ReleaseYear":2006},"152479":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Melty Blood Act Cadenza Version B2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ecole Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"6b0424af-df22-44c5-a48c-da2283fcc028.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"118b8713-cefa-4fbd-ac10-7c2f36257f35.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a436c9c-df8d-4202-a127-a9f0752a0e18.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7027a5ec-2316-4d8e-bc75-556842aeb1ad.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Melty Blood Act Cadenza","Overview":"Melty Blood follows one year after Tsukihime and some days after of Kagetsu Tohya.

DOCWE is an updated English port of Derby Owners Club 2000 for non-Asia market. The format of the game is a player uses one of several consoles (called satellites) at the arcade to train horses, and then races them against 11 other computer AI horses or any number of other players (up to between 3 and 11 others, depending on location and format used) on tracks and G-1 races. Each player acts as owner, trainer, and jockey at each console. Players then can train their horses to improve in the horses abilities (Start, Corner, Competing, Out of Box, Tenacious, and Spurt) through the use of pre-purchased memory cards, breeding via the console, or retired dam and sire cards, in order for you to breed your own retired horses you will have to race them twenty times, then you will have the option of retiring them or to continue their career. These improvements can be augmented by foods rewarded by how the person plays the training segment. The horse is then matched up with other horses in the races and the player can now race the horse, with the use of either whipping or hold buttons. Depending on where the horses finish, they are awarded a purse. Back at the stables, the owner must now gauge the horse's personality after the race. The horse either gains or suffers hearts through the owner's actions. \n\nThe EX release adds new horses and horse handicapping in every race. The EX upgrade is designed for newer players to be more competitive with each other after breeding horses. In EX there are new sires and dams in the breed list. To determine if EX is installed, look for EX in the lower right while the satellite is in DEMO mode.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2005,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/UrUggreTkeo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Derby_Owners_Club#Derby_Owners_Club_World_Edition-EX"}}
