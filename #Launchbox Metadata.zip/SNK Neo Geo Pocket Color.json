If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points.

Eternal Dungeons tells the story of the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is to take quests in the town and then assemble your party and attempt to clear out the many dungeons in the game, grinding your characters and getting the loot and experience needed to advance the plot and buy items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance his combat abilities.\n\nAs expected for a portable version, the gameplay has been significantly downgraded from its original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed instead of randomly generated. Combat is turn-based using a menu system from which you select your actions for each party member (up to 3) and execute them, but otherwise remains unchanged.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2000-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PKNYdKf7qF4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Evolution:_Eternal_Dungeons"},"18504":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sacnoth","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"90ed67ad-ff59-42ed-b7fc-599f4be44a9d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d7ed4a8b-f950-4c39-b145-651e29f3a8f1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"62d4a255-80e2-4147-ac05-bcce91d9595d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cee9d9bb-10bd-4060-a2e1-37913fc13d6a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6a8fb10-e78b-4c7e-bad0-1c524e962b72.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"48b673e2-0748-470f-9ed4-9f770113790b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b04bdca3-8afb-4b11-8cb5-b08de03e0e54.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c5b09020-a900-4424-8301-e651cf99e7bc.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"87c03b30-66b6-4075-9625-4228f42ffb29.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"73237626-cee6-418f-8959-564be8389397.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c8869ca4-6cf7-4c0f-b73b-8c40c125c77a.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Faselei!","Overview":"Faselei! is one of the last titles to be released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and even features digitised lyrics to the game's main theme. Heavily story driven, this strategy RPG takes place in a time when mechs known as TS are the weapon of choice for combat. Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles.\n\nBattles are part turn based and part real-time. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in real-time for the duration of the turn. This makes thinking about what your opponents and allies will do in advance essential before taking your turn.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vv6C_o4-URI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sacnoth#Faselei.21"},"18505":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters' Clash: Capcom Version","Region":"North America"},{"AlternateName":"SNK vs. Capcom: Gekitotsu Card Fighters - Capcom Supporter Version","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"07c7b922-820a-40dd-8d49-7f04d580feb5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b0a5937b-1388-459d-af03-b6f3835c4f86.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d316c8db-8987-4011-b821-4cd141dcf063.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c768eeda-60ff-4923-9e53-3ae0a93b935f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"135222b9-5039-4b53-bf2c-7d74ded635dd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"24e8467a-8c79-4aeb-a384-b6881b6528f4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cc9f6ebe-1e18-4a11-893b-5afd75f05738.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1ae160b9-0445-4c0e-9460-cddd3c4c56ca.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f312869b-7b79-42a4-a53d-1dd710f29a43.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"214cc22c-0a97-43dd-bd9a-ef37091deaa6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a2f72bbd-5d39-4e64-a38c-2574f2015f3a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3b58b2a3-eea2-41d7-9d7b-4f924afd44f4.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters' Clash: Capcom Cardfighter's Version","Overview":"Cut loose with your favorite characters in the card-battle clash of the century!

New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.\n\nThere are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game also has link cable support for two players.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18509":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"04260b6e-c024-4e6d-aa16-0eb3b1ec1872.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"da8b3c4e-10cd-47e8-8bdf-73af47a71b0b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d8fbc22a-ca8f-4470-bf63-9ade1bb22a1f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f761ca7-6fd5-45aa-b5c4-cc379fe595fb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"85d57c11-ab00-486d-bfec-e26f3ca50414.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac72aa18-7796-445e-b150-35d2a5411e34.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"043bd9f0-499a-4131-932c-22a4bb3417b3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6fec5bce-1c6e-43eb-9241-289be887d61e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c232c352-8fb2-4555-a11f-22f632f179d9.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2456253d-d62f-4762-ac79-62d2027453ab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1ae30f18-b073-4766-81ce-6637495b4c5f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1b966b67-1966-4c15-98cf-1f2374358609.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"88b3b53a-e637-4557-a2b6-419573a81b92.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f020a56a-d781-4281-b11c-ddf9d96ada27.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Shanghai Mini","Overview":"Shanghai Mini is a release in the series of Activision's tile matching games.

It offers a selection of modes and levels seen in earlier entries.\n\nThe game includes three different game modes. Puzzle mode consists of 99 puzzles, taken from various earlier entries in the series for a \"best of\". The first ten levels can be selected from the start, and the best clearing times are saved per level. VS mode is the competitive variant of the game, played in best-of-three matches either against one of several different CPU opponents (with different strategies) or against another player via link connection. Survivor mode is an endless mode played for high score.\n\nGameplay follows the standard model: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the play field that shoots randomly colored bubbles. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. In puzzle mode, the ceiling moves downward after a while, while in the other modes, additional bubbles are added from the top. In survivor mode only, bubbles also are added from the bottom sometimes. The game is lost once the bubbles reach the bottom. Popping more than three bubbles at a time moves extra bubbles to the opponent's field in VS mode.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tBisHD1-MZE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bust-a-Move_Pocket"},"22446":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"NeoGeo Cup '98 Plus Color: Pocket Sports Series","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"15e16346-fcd7-4fdb-abd6-aba1e39ea77a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5f9129e6-f1a3-4ac5-b2fc-56a3789d2734.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d69e5108-2e0b-4758-a0aa-2408134a8fa1.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6cf64aba-7088-4e02-9c04-78825e16b772.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"459bdeae-2976-47d3-8b95-fd68a5af94bb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"96454fab-931f-47ef-8e12-4af428d28f39.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61328854-00bc-44f7-84f7-c03f4e73eeef.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"927b96fd-9e8b-4c13-b3f5-70638d7ca8a1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3cce4924-de5e-4a7c-a153-22f46119b782.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"42ee5254-ec82-4c98-bed6-64c61f6ee9c4.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fb07e327-402b-47bd-9456-35c0b6c886c4.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Neo Geo Cup '98 Plus Color","Overview":"NeoGeo Cup '98 Plus is a soccer game for the Neo Geo Pocket.

Fortunately, a fan translation patch can be used to translate the text into English.\n\nNew Features\n-----------------\nCard Fighters 2 features a more straightforward single-player mode, as opposed to the RPG-like gameplay of the first Card Fighters game. Several new characters are added, both from SNK and Capcom. In addition, special edition cards (featuring non-SD picture art) are added.\n\nThe only addition gameplay-wise is the Reaction card, which are essentially Action cards that are played right before defending an attack. Otherwise, the core game is identical to the first Card Fighters.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2001-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SNK_vs._Capcom:_Card_Fighters_Clash#SVC:_Card_Fighters_2_Expand_Edition"},"131541":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Success","Images":[{"FileName":"bad5f70a-0358-42e2-a936-4839e41bff4c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a2d9fa6-306d-4aed-975a-faf0d747ebfa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e001bace-0da1-485b-b7d9-7fe678c8e88c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"942c4369-6655-476c-baea-4130b83303ec.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d6f28759-53ba-43af-92b7-5bb683a0d2fa.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5ee6cb1f-5018-4cfc-83a2-82a151961c40.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2eddc1b6-f9eb-4be9-90b3-322e09da09db.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams","Overview":"The Evil Mist has slipped into Fairyland and smothered the Prism of Light in an everlasting blackness.
