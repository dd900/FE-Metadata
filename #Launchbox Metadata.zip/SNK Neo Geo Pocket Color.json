It offers a selection of modes and levels seen in earlier entries.\n\nThe game includes three different game modes. Puzzle mode consists of 99 puzzles, taken from various earlier entries in the series for a \"best of\". The first ten levels can be selected from the start, and the best clearing times are saved per level. VS mode is the competitive variant of the game, played in best-of-three matches either against one of several different CPU opponents (with different strategies) or against another player via link connection. Survivor mode is an endless mode played for high score.\n\nGameplay follows the standard model: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the play field that shoots randomly colored bubbles. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. In puzzle mode, the ceiling moves downward after a while, while in the other modes, additional bubbles are added from the top. In survivor mode only, bubbles also are added from the bottom sometimes. The game is lost once the bubbles reach the bottom. Popping more than three bubbles at a time moves extra bubbles to the opponent's field in VS mode.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBisHD1-MZE","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo Pocket Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Ukiyotei","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"b4b07f78-90f2-44a4-b32c-3cef9bfb23ee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"b1789b95-7844-473b-9bbd-da7a251f1f3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"48e616ba-de7a-4093-a0d5-3137432010cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"9365ef11-3f2d-451d-8d99-b6a03660adb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"2b48f978-b3bd-447f-8c76-53b0a552d3a2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"b287f007-32f7-4fee-963d-c8d0b7a02e4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"4fc8413e-1058-4363-879b-267a7c86d55d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"b847a1c8-cf8e-483d-ba0c-73bdd02e5169.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"c3ff8b3c-0385-4bed-848a-2cc98cec8585.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"44dca77a-6177-4efb-a99f-8f61257bda37.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"76f327bc-a12f-4007-951b-549a4d7728ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"eb0d3e20-19fb-41f8-b988-d3b46ce8010d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"490cc5ad-004c-4df1-a05d-611a4cd562c2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"62ad1dde-61b1-4870-81d9-2ce7ae26c842.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"3e199d3b-3e5f-4742-adac-cc8ba9b9bf10.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"f3ba7407-6771-4232-bfcb-57c0616b94c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"f86ce664-50f6-40f7-b446-b055e4bbe136.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"0b09468c-434b-4f9c-ba92-35798e6d28ff.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"b889389e-a4ce-4605-8f27-0905f0c2e13f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"FileName":"2ada3c8a-a2e3-4899-a337-d8f6e7a82e2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22445,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble Mini","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22445,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble Mini","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":18500,"Name":"Cool Boarders Pocket","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Cool Boarders Pocket differs to other games in the Cool Boarders series.

While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life.\n\nA level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points.\n\nEvery once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted.\n\nWhen the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket Color version has multiple levels.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7UEHcB3C0","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo Pocket Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"ADK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1999-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"fa74589d-bd5b-4b90-a189-39cac08657ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"113b9eac-7fcb-43e9-aa09-67b2f6b792d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"c7cb5e79-21e7-4fe5-a8f1-6345f19156f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"046a405c-d346-4c88-b3b5-73df974f7e60.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"7fe9ce3e-560c-43b5-b19e-1c2e6c2145fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"af6a0d44-d39d-42b4-97dd-36cfa782d105.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"dd4d9ec7-7fb3-4150-93a7-647e39d1c4fd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"dd4cbf4d-4ed3-4c2e-87e5-f4e9c17f715b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"e08c302a-ee3a-403d-bd76-f9251ffdf84d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"d6b36e67-720c-4384-87e5-44894f9fde01.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18490,"FileName":"fe71af72-3513-484b-a73c-f5346e33e7b2.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18495,"Name":"Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"\"I crave power.

Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles.\n\nBattles are part turn based and part real-time. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in real-time for the duration of the turn.

Several new characters are added, both from SNK and Capcom. In addition, special edition cards (featuring non-SD picture art) are added.\n\nThe only addition gameplay-wise is the Reaction card, which are essentially Action cards that are played right before defending an attack.
