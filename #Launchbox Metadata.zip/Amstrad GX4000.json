It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, which can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and deposit them either in the playing area (which can hold 25 blocks in a 5X5 arrangement) or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. An uncaught block is considered a \"drop\". A flashing block can be used as a wildcard on any colour. In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by arranging three or more of the same color into a continuous line, known as a \"Klax.\" The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (e.g., one vertical and horizontal) counts as multiple Klaxes, as does Klaxes of four same-colored blocks (two Klaxes) or five same-colored blocks (three Klaxes). Once the goal is reached, bonus points are awarded for remaining blocks on the conveyor belt and device, and empty spaces in the bin (also, on levels where a certain point total is required, points in excess of the required amount are counted both in the scoring and as bonus points)","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Klax_(video_game)"},"126357":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ocean","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ca9bcff8-8704-4e64-970d-13b953897247.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"405b9395-e9b4-4dd1-ad07-b5b08d52a723.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e905587f-5bbf-4c30-b41b-aec38d5aeb1a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9ae2737a-bb8b-4436-9c3a-16345601f43f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b6a10fa-afa3-47c7-a87d-f022bee30b62.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"4d7ec496-9e17-44d2-8125-47ca1af0a86d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f8570aaf-5ce6-491e-b931-980e09591c75.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"59ddc1d5-3801-40ed-a561-3a13095c7cf2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7877db09-ce1c-40fa-aa56-234006c9033c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e9906cd2-72ea-414c-ac06-082f3e7923f9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pang","Overview":"In the game, the Buster brothers must finish a round-the-world quest to destroy bouncing balloons that are terrorizing several of Earth's landmarks and cities.

These events were already present on computer versions of World Games, but if the game was renamed World of Sports on GX 4000 is simply that, we find here only 4 of the many events present on the original version. So let's go over the 4 parts of the game.\n\nFirst of all the bike cross event, entitled BMX. The cap well pressed on the skull, gloved hands gripping the handlebars, you're ready to go. You have a minute to complete the course of moguls, descents, haystacks. Points will be awarded if you browse all this in style (but if metal tubes and wheels that can have style). There is mess in the air.\n\nIn the slalom race, we stay on a track, but it is white and cold because it is snow. Your skier goes with the joystick, skid, acceleration, all responding perfectly to the player's orders. You have 45 seconds to hit the track, and points will score two points per pass. Fun and difficult to make a faultless course in record time.\n\nThe third test is surfing titled Surfing very cleverly. With tanned skin, blond hair in the wind, and the board underfoot, you will have to ride a huge wave and do tricks in the air to score a maximum of points. As in other events, everything happens in a limited time. The character is animated, and the wave is composed of a gradient of pretty blue.\n\nAccapulco its beaches, its sun, its rocks, and at the top of the rocks, its crackers who plunge dizzying heights shouting \"Yaaaaawaaaayaaaaa\" and crashing in a few meters of water that goes and comes. You may not know it, but you are part of this race of the unconscious. Admit to the best dive possible by avoiding to smash you on the rock face, or to smash your skull at the bottom of the water. After each jump, a bird passes by with a beak, a banner indicating the note that you obtained for your modest performance. If you blow your mouth, a pelican covers his eyes with his wings. Funny. The animation and the neat graphics, make this event too, a success.","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"127432":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Trojan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"98fb6d73-bb9c-45b2-872f-7d568181511f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f6891439-11ca-4f10-92e7-b51b4f43b983.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e0533efc-f090-4537-baae-2da9728fa864.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ed5259a7-ff99-49bd-bc58-f7adc07d9c6b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"647e3c0b-aa2c-4fb3-80ce-f9ab62a00d6a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7efd9014-c66f-4ebc-aedb-9c7dbca73323.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d6c7603a-1f24-45d5-a0ba-23e7ea5c899d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8776e8fb-881b-4a8d-aa72-4de2acb7ef0e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"822482c5-d50d-4e67-b974-11aa448caafd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Enforcer","Overview":"Your job is to gun down dozens of bad guys as they pop up from beind trash cans (that's American dustbins), peer out of windows.
