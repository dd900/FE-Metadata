This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves \"The Divine Ones\", began conquering nations one after another. \"The Chosen People\" carried out these conquests in \"the name of peace\".\n\nMeanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (森羅?).\nShot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga.\n\nThe Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (天内?) with the help of Kazamori (風守?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the \"Sword of Acala\", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2002-09-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0GYzLxul3Y0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ikaruga?wprov=sfla1"},"420":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Horror; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"eb0b02f3-0bfc-4edf-8adb-e088dc34fcca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fcfcc41c-9e54-439b-950d-c45af695588a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"956b6a42-935b-456f-8d96-615830cfbd76.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1b424b7e-1084-4faa-acaf-8edd49078d82.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a3e07069-1291-41d9-ad40-6351bbfbd9d9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"515836aa-e6f4-4738-b0d3-29a029f4cd3f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b863b79c-ddf2-4206-9a2c-2e7e9db548f4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bf69b68d-e0a9-4a97-b258-b39e32ef59bd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"717b5d45-1be0-491c-8dfd-98ed63072a65.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"67693a43-e398-4d7d-ba5a-02df3c1ed372.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2808937b-795d-4a31-93be-9d32b418e2ac.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"6ce40ec4-49db-4e06-8766-38925150bc5a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"133624bf-7045-4c7a-9b24-68b6f202febc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3390e3ff-2179-4322-9981-5b6311ec4ab2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"07779614-ddc7-4d0e-b810-6234878e329c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a1dce8a0-7c03-47f5-bd23-6fedafdaaff9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1b678dbb-8d78-44fc-b721-ccfcd5d36d00.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9bfc01ba-8b4c-4e26-a36f-6c452ddbd50a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"add11cec-2982-4df8-a96c-c51961c285e1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"73e6fd09-c3b1-4730-a9c0-a6c69a9e4455.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ac7598d3-3945-4b74-b421-67e0494125a0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b9c7f5ca-aa2b-4cd1-b74b-dd86dd7e0ef6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fe9b5d4b-a9ab-490b-bd45-1a90adc3f1d5.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ae974f34-7273-451d-804b-8a2bde8e7da2.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2a63733f-8b47-4b91-82ff-8d7ad1146e66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b69500dc-48f6-4059-a02d-9917ae0f9eb3.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8bcba683-7677-40a0-8cd2-07cb17de4eaf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"77bbc7bc-c056-42cf-a4ab-11cd54e7f32c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0fc13ed3-747e-4e2b-a383-49dfa1bf2be8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ef8e9d49-ea74-4976-aa6b-d57681de4828.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aed2fd3f-a31c-4d10-9198-7a17b7abb348.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8fa1d00f-7366-4692-8940-94effb3ad992.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9e00c8cb-df73-4ed8-aced-c272a887eefd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fe528201-e439-405b-bbfd-e5875fceaf27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dino Crisis","Overview":"Dino Crisis is a survival horror video game by Capcom, released in 2000 for Microsoft Windows.

Vyse and Aika bring Fina back to their clan's ship, which Vyse pilots back to their secret hideout, Pirate Island (disguised as a small village).","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=paU58G6oXEM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skies_of_Arcadia"},"432":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sonic Team","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b019793a-2f21-4693-b888-82808ae5fec5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e6f14699-7ad3-4a79-9874-843ead265712.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"53494515-e80b-49ac-aca1-2adb61cb764f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d1c834a8-d264-448b-a857-82200d504c77.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"973bc271-341c-4faa-af56-d902a6101e4f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8635aaf3-9a01-4466-ba99-fd29159a948b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a6c6ff1d-955c-4c72-9acd-4d3d1cd70933.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"aa2f4528-a2fc-4a29-bd05-0f213ce244a5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6124699d-b16a-4f83-a3be-cb36ad4b457b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"60947689-4ac0-4281-a1ff-d81e054c6f72.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d127404c-b5d2-450f-9d52-a50fbf78df47.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6fa3016-f291-4c2c-868a-3842e2f62267.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be2d173d-0300-493f-8655-876f33881e80.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cb52267c-ab7f-4e3c-9884-51f230f5f993.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7cd17bf6-00aa-42fd-bed7-9557b33327a5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1d9dad34-66a6-42ff-b9c8-f5b06b6c7a99.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"96a0e6ba-cb07-4a4c-8f6b-020bdff17d50.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2db3de6f-c077-4f37-894c-f8bb36027ea3.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4c3e2217-0806-40b2-8455-0e8c5b2d4c8e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf51b7fc-7c50-4b87-bc3b-df264027990f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sonic Adventure 2","Overview":"After discovering the existence of a secret weapon mentioned in the diary of his grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. facility in search of it.

It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer. However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect. Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue. Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole. This is called his magnogimmick. Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums. Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.\n\nYou must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.\n\nThere is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick.

Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami, board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.\n\nBangai-O is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to Hover Attack. The player manoeuvres the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions.

Elemental Gimmick Gear uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles.\n\nIn the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied.\n\nUpon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as \"Elemental Gimmick Gear\", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as vehicles.\n\n100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna.\n\nAt the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab.

Although Alien Front was fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) could battle it out. Players move around the arena attempting to blast each other with their weaponry, while also looking for power-ups that will enhance their ability to wreak massive destruction. Typically, the game was played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills would be declared the winners. Being killed while playing the game had no serious consequences (you simply respawned in a different part of the area you were in), but it did reflect on your win\/loss score.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2001-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PX2RfaarIlg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alien_Front_Online"},"2412":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hitmaker","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"35833188-7219-42c7-83e8-dfd2c3085ea1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8655215e-05a7-4652-abc6-363d57e80a88.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"98e199ea-95f1-43f7-a345-9bee0bfe5938.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7b74cf1e-9772-4361-8c55-d9ad902aa92c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"be1ec648-1ef4-472f-aa03-bc5cb132e778.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1c4e04a0-372d-4bf0-828e-647b6db7f589.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bf8ae697-8fd7-4d72-ad57-ecd0fe1c4219.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"418e2018-f096-43fc-80a5-9d169848d465.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d690e302-64e7-48d2-8845-15dea1dafbfd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c6232906-ced0-4f7e-a24e-ec2fad7a16ab.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b88c85ff-fb99-42fe-9cf4-fe001b64e368.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e15c4a0d-e0b9-4efb-a8bd-4caab9ff27f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"42a7d015-b860-4e15-82d2-927d8a5d80b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"497286a1-0a20-4d1b-80fe-8767de649065.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"88fa52b8-272e-49e7-bcda-b063d79b2eb6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"873ec5ac-ccf1-4df9-a6d2-e7132f38655e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3ce33e5d-0d0d-4e34-b6db-9eeef7e4fdfd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6e0a6f13-0d06-49c3-8063-86579778b952.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fd1845e5-da1b-43de-afbb-733d586b7d50.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"64b35cd9-b67d-44c1-9b66-37b1f4ada9c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"298ff960-6a47-45c6-865f-e65a01417d46.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"77e759ea-e9fc-4b87-a79e-ce50940c69d9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9e3224f4-1277-4467-85f3-4954870b6105.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bd017fa5-450f-497b-8b8e-4f10873adf8d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e429da60-aa0e-424f-962f-19ff9b30bae3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7896d567-8f88-4515-9eb2-53259d6517a0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ff8a1089-535b-4379-821c-4a0ee76c7174.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crazy Taxi 2","Overview":"Much like the original, the core gameplay in Crazy Taxi 2 centers around picking people up at destinations which are highlighted with colored rings, and dropping them off at stated destinations.\n\nCrazy Taxi 2 added multiple pickups, which enabled the player to carry multiple passengers, (previously it was restricted to one passenger per journey). The game also saw the introduction of the \"Crazy Hop\" feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time, as they taxi passengers around the locations.

However, the dolphins and humans drove them to the brink of defeat, and so the Foe sought vengeance on Earth. The few caretaker dolphins who had been left behind on Earth were not entirely defenseless; they were protected by their creation called the Guardian—a gigantic, sentient being made of a crystalline substance which projected a forcefield over the entire planet.

An Asteroids-like RPG, Armada was a sci-fi shooter that allowed 1-4 players to fly about the universe, fighting the enemy, performing missions and improving their ship. The player would gather credits to buy power-ups for their ship, allowing them to voyage deeper into enemy territory, blow up ever more powerful Armada, and perform missions of increasing importance and danger as the alliance fights not only for answers as to why the Armada attack, but for their very lives.","Publisher":"Metro3D, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-31T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Armada_%28video_game%29?wprov=sfla1"},"3523":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"DMA Design","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7403642f-d6e5-4024-8224-d712c1224ce1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e8e30b9-6a03-48a1-972a-e81358b708bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"248c04c6-8652-42d1-9dfc-a9c2d2e54fca.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0854a880-5433-40ad-af3a-97eae89a0cc0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"32502be0-9cd7-4c63-82ee-a87c00b4ef3c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73bcddc6-a5a6-4250-8df4-ce57253fba98.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"903600f2-d2f0-4993-9d18-d1667190490c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d9aae56c-285e-433c-a43d-7d26b51aa56e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"522d69b2-e0f8-4501-88cf-0e82032a4b95.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4953c35e-7390-4979-96a6-803a1f1ea6df.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c5ed193e-3aef-4911-ba91-124e6c3d0a14.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"453eee5b-7219-4697-b3fb-d7743ef5ded4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wild Metal","Overview":"Kill or be killed.

Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue features beloved characters from 101 Dalmatians and new characters based on the upcoming 102 Dalmatians live action movie.\n\nThe game follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.","Publisher":"Eidos Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EeOn0iPB3UE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/102_Dalmatians:_Puppies_to_the_Rescue"},"3575":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"f059d204-0322-498d-a4ae-9dd74d804aad.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"bbf5f802-e724-4f36-a81e-b9ba27e3bf95.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f7ab0efb-ee3f-48a7-962c-236bad2b3872.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bca51cd8-ce97-49ba-8463-fb794d3f90e2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0dc7e959-b33b-4321-b4c7-58e0fd97c017.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"730bdb9d-dc02-44f1-b69a-6f453704a33d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6a9bbaa3-1488-4531-9ac7-947d7c30c695.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9f783beb-7ed0-4874-9fbd-d1c8aec5bb2b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0e6bb6ee-a1ea-4e8e-88b7-b2be703fbb8a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"add2951a-4f3a-40e8-a064-e27ffc1805ca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2cf930ff-cdaf-441c-9b94-43c323e470d3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"0bcec3fe-b82d-4d62-aa9b-cd44a75b6f90.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"161c9ecb-1c54-4e75-af31-a46a82cbd3ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"289a6c32-79f8-4250-a47b-48d42ef95c37.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e6f76ab9-11df-4527-a748-06afa3b34255.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"43621538-8d30-42e1-b154-6a74d08a12e0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0d1f2d66-3c54-4e8b-9340-c47ae3e8b22b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c978d38d-e788-408d-9183-dfe678182985.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ff42723e-2048-41ca-92cf-774f9234597f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7f4f991c-b1da-4278-8098-fe8a901ae147.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7cc5d3e6-69e4-4869-ba89-633b3efda921.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1f39ab49-c8c8-461b-ad2c-910b982773ae.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Zombie Revenge","Overview":"A top secret government plan to use undead soldiers has gone horribly wrong.

Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it presents an original story set during the One Year War between the Earth Federation and Zeon, parallel to the events of the first Gundam TV series. It takes place in Australia and stars the mobile suit team White Dingo, a guerrilla combat unit supporting the main forces of a Federation counteroffensive against the Zeonic forces.\n\nThe player controls Lt. Rayer, who along with his team mates Leung, Mike and Anita must fight Zeon in nine missions. The squad of three mobile suits (Anita controls the OASIS hover truck) must be outfitted by choosing suits, weapons, and shields. Two suits are available from the start: RGM-79 and RGC-80, with the RGC more heavily armed and armored at the cost of reduced mobility.\n\nMissions are seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, but also employ in-engine cutscenes to show plot developments. Mission objectives usually include the destruction of a specific enemy unit or structure, but goals can change mid-mission. Leung and Mike fight on their own but can also be given specific orders, including movement and search patterns, attacking specific enemies or defending friendly units. They can be given preferences for long- mid- or close-range combat. Anita's OASIS truck cannot attack or defend, but can be used to detect enemies on the map through a special radar scan.

The player views the environments from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards.

Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population.

In the skies over Canada, Laura's plane has been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black-robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase \"Shadow, the final destroyer\". Laura's compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below.\n\nIn the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.\n\nD-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos.\n\nHorrifying monsters will attack randomly (or serve as boss fights at specific points of the plot), at which point the player is taken to a separate combat screen. Laura must dispatch of the enemies by rapidly shooting at them, in a way not dissimilar to the shooting sequences of Snatcher. Enemies can attack from different sides, so the player often has to turn around and quickly react to their attacks. Laura's default gun is weak, but uses unlimited ammunition; stronger guns with limited ammo can be found by exploring the surroundings. Laura receives experience points for defeating enemies and eventually levels up, becoming stronger and having her hit points increased.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2000-08-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/D2_(video_game)"},"8118":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pitbull Syndicate","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"43f69f0a-ec85-4a09-9992-35959ac9f3bd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"dd6e69d6-85dd-4064-89b0-c8b58698ac6a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"751b5225-7a2c-4cf0-94ab-9e0860aeb857.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"99d1a3a3-afbe-4d2c-8023-652f59613120.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a076b335-2216-4044-8d1a-3dc1ec853b02.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"36df62f3-c30d-4771-b4a3-28f4b7350aa0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4775debf-02e7-4784-9d9e-6b020965b080.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Demolition Racer: No Exit","Overview":"The sequel to Demolition Racer.

The stones are said to be the only way to destroy Medallion once and for all. The player can choose to complete the journey for any of the four pilots.\n\nGiga Wing is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up. Up to two players must steer their planes around enemy bullets and destroy everything in their path with only a limited amount of lives. When tapping the A button, the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.\n\nScoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2000-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D6OJRtRS8uQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giga_Wing?wprov=sfla1"},"8133":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"DMA Design","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"3eacfb5e-b62d-42f5-82de-b922ffc6f73c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"193bc971-48d9-4355-add5-b92606f9c6a4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1a4bf465-e285-4922-bc9b-d475aa40bc61.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e8d953b7-a092-4af2-8e2d-355f7d839c4a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"123b6a71-c51f-4ea1-9956-d2bbc5b7d143.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eea9ab98-648a-4d80-aa1a-17c265dd8e65.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d88d48b1-3218-4cd0-84a0-87a194aff268.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"8d87a750-00db-4fba-8e0f-08e0098329ac.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"63d2779f-7b7e-4d6d-a5df-b248f45f3d51.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5c33fb7e-1b10-44e5-b4b7-1ba6f709ec6e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"877d1383-84bd-48e9-847e-f3f3784c9540.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"88045b32-b30d-4d80-978c-fd7e2171c74c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Grand Theft Auto 2","Overview":"Lie, cheat, and steal your way through three districts of a huge city in the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto. Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.\n\nThe game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.\n\nBecause the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.\n\nNew features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.","Publisher":"Rockstar Games","ReleaseDate":"2000-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grand_Theft_Auto_2"},"8134":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Captivation Digital Laboratories","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e50226d9-d232-4ed1-83c2-4de6e9524cf3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ea79cd1e-6633-43ae-8c0d-ed2ffc78e471.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5dee17ac-35f5-4b94-b229-204a0806d8ce.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2d317cd7-884c-4932-8654-75708c891fc8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d7ef0278-bbf9-4bc5-8cdd-6ef35b5cdffd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d9d88410-eed8-451b-869a-1b2ac2abb905.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"029c217a-02d8-4833-bae8-ff394b846fc6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8447162c-ce51-45b9-a662-10e035c0ccaf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"68c7c90b-02fc-4e37-981b-27403c825898.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3b73703c-1b14-44cd-ad7a-906685968ff7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9ae066ad-1406-4fe4-b60c-5e605db4e81e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"9cd2989e-e9ef-45a1-be46-a7d0698784f9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"b5e29fab-fb56-48b5-8877-5c1ee59f01b0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Half-Life","Overview":"Deep in the bowels of the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility, a decommissioned missile base, a top-secret experiment goes terribly wrong.

Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.\n\nThe gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.","Publisher":"Xicat Interactive, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"8140":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Awesome Developments","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1ddb57b4-85da-4325-8a12-259bee008461.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e1439bb8-8567-496b-bc1f-26ec2a4e0626.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"112c9aa2-6de4-439d-b8ef-c5bf9a909297.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9e1ce97f-ac71-4586-b460-b4f125d26027.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"766202be-156a-41ef-88d9-7131e1d651ed.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e635296a-a227-4ed9-9be2-dedbadf23227.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"43ce990c-4779-43af-841e-68ca37114550.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2b28a58c-cae6-467d-9b2a-3c2f4cfe1b72.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"659e4239-18bb-4d1b-8cb8-964e0f46fbc8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jimmy White's 2: Cueball","Overview":"Licensed by snooker player Jimmy White, this game is a simulation of not only the British game of snooker, but also of the three main variations of pool.\n\nThe game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base.

In the snooker mode playing accurate 'safety' shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes important as well).\n\nIn each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges.

The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others,[citation needed] helping add to the authenticity of the game.\n\nThe sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.","Publisher":"Ubi Soft","ReleaseDate":"1999-08-31T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monaco_Grand_Prix_%28video_game%29?wprov=sfla1"},"8145":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Hometek Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"62dc6b30-5e39-4938-b145-7db64f76f579.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a5fabc80-7464-4cb7-aaf5-9b2df6c5854d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2712a0e4-ed87-4f08-8ddd-c82740f63481.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3ddd4ef-8eca-4c84-a6a3-4d6e5024a1cc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c357e81e-4f3e-4ff1-b980-cfecaddf2fa3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness","Overview":"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness has Ms. Pac-Man saving Pac-Land once again, although this in full 3D.\n\nThe four Wonders, mystical regions separated from the rest of Pac-Land by force fields, contains four Gems of Virtue: Generosity, Truth, Wisdom and Courage, each holding enough power to help keep Pac-Land safe from evil.

There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans.

Up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can participate in arcade and head-to-head modes. Each player can train or control a team of 12 virtual athletes for whichever nationality he or she chooses. Arcade mode allows you to jump right into any one of the 12 events and test the waters without training your athletes. Two types of play are available: classic and repeat. In classic style, you play all 12 events only once while earning points based on performance in each. Repeat play offers basically the same format with the main difference being the chance to gain higher scores by replaying the events. Olympic mode lets you train a team of 12 athletes, build strength and morale, sharpen skills and prepare for qualification at Olympic trials. This mode offers a 4-stage approach to reaching the goal of Olympic competition: training, invitation, championship, and then the Games themselves. Gymnastics and field and track are just a couple of the activities practiced in this mode.","Publisher":"Eidos, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2000-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sydney_2000_(video_game)"},"8328":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Golf Shiyouyo","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acclaim Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"15d5fd21-4d6d-4ca0-89ec-257e4dd5a7a8.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"009ed700-e5d0-4c4f-9807-6afbe1b782ab.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c590bf86-e994-4744-995e-32d1f5b500a3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cdcfcb0f-4166-436f-bef0-14c479da6ec9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"19e94bd4-c848-44f4-8f09-c4863100b457.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"01690f6c-f811-40be-9a18-4357480b710f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"57180ab7-7a0d-4550-a0b4-aa03c4343bc8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"352e2638-1314-4d31-a9d2-e9e05bcdab06.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7672fdc2-4b6e-4ab8-b982-d6b07c6ddf6c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61ee7397-cf73-4dd6-aed4-9001628c1e23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70102d74-31fc-40d1-ad18-e40e893623b6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"1a8a3233-a38f-47d3-8d7e-bf194a43522d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5cabc946-628e-4e42-b75a-f445f3229d95.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d81ae866-7dd2-48da-b143-58a7fe93510d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Tee Off","Overview":"One of the few golf games for the DC, with a cartoony style.

Refusing to share their technique with the rest of the world, Igem eventually developed a weather control machine named ONI, which they intend to use for the purpose of global domination. A squadron of ace helicopter pilots, called Zero Gunner, is assembled to destroy ONI - but Igem fights back with everything they've got...\n\nZero Gunner 2 is a top-down shooter. All backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D, though the gameplay mostly follows the conventions of 2D shooters. Since your craft is a helicopter, a \"target and spin\" feature has been added, whereby you can both rotate your craft to attack an enemy more efficiently, or alternatively lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. These actions are not automatically executed, and are controlled by the player; in order to succeed, mastering this feature is imperative.\n\nThe usual power-ups and boss enemy battles are included in the game, along with a selection of helicopters to choose from.","Publisher":"Psikyo","ReleaseDate":"2001-05-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zero_Gunner_2?wprov=sfla1"},"9968":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Triangle Service","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"f90645be-652d-405b-b480-518ddb862c54.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"192e252b-3763-4342-ba78-64ec74048263.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"24adbf62-d874-4551-a3e4-50524be3f3c9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05dd1fe1-b08c-4817-8539-84f7d8b34c19.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4434152e-0744-4d58-b8d3-95eb6f4d3e8f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Trizeal","Overview":"Trizeal is a Japanese shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Triangle Service.\n\nDreamcast version\n\nIt offers a score attack mode, a sound test mode and new stages that weren't in the arcade version.\n\nAlthough this game is a Japan-only release it is quite \"import-friendly\" as there is some English displayed during game play.\n\nThe game was made by only three staff members and the console conversions were handled by only one person.","Publisher":"Triangle Service","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trizeal"},"9969":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Trigger Heart Exelica"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Warashi","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"78ad1ec1-c223-4526-ae92-d30c6f5d4708.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"084623dd-a12e-45d2-b138-8ac2cc961bda.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8ec1f06e-745a-49fb-a487-271488b94dbf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f5930644-ca37-4a52-add5-5bd09e71c48c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4d6d128d-2717-4e69-a740-b8ccfe385b78.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4047ec3a-8cde-4949-a28e-efc29d737c4e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c6c969fc-657c-4f6a-8fd8-096ede4d746c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c418decc-fd92-4ebd-b422-9d337f850a2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"154c81e0-ade6-4578-a767-75f22bd49a9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Triggerheart Exelica","Overview":"Trigger Heart Exelica is a vertical shoot-'em-up game released exclusively in Japan for the Sega NAOMI and Sega Dreamcast.

There are several characters to choose from, each with a unique truck and attributes.\n\nThe game starts out in Key West and players travel across the United States, ending in San Francisco. After Stage 1, the game gives the player a choice of trailer. One trailer is harder to haul, but provides a bigger payoff while the other choice is easier to haul but provides a smaller payoff. Money is deducted from the total when the trailer is hit. Players can sound the truck's horn to make other cars on the road yield and slipstream behind large vehicles to gain a momentary speed boost.\n\nIn addition to the time limit, players also compete with the \"Lizard Tail\", a rival trucker. Crossing the finish line before the Lizard Tail yields additional money.

In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA).

Unfortunately, a lack of features, shoddy audio presentation, and major gameplay flaws meant that WSB2K1 was not well received by critics despite its fantastic graphics. The game is notorious for its sometimes-unresponsive controls, as well as the fact that manual fielding—a staple of baseball games for a half-decade prior to WSB2K1's release—isn't even an option available to players.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the debacle that was World Series Baseball 2K1, Sega decided to bring Visual Concepts (the developer behind the Dreamcast's far more successful NBA 2K and NFL 2K series) in for the next version of the game. The result was World Series Baseball 2K2, a game that was considered a major improvement over WSB2K1.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2000-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Series_Baseball_2K1?wprov=sfla1"},"11060":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Visual Concepts","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7fd87983-0e02-4c95-9c8f-502aea33f5c6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"340454ea-d0b1-4075-b267-2861272c04c6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8dc510f5-7dbc-4dc7-96f6-2ecaf5a48935.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf14c3dc-8b2c-4b52-98ee-eca8ca322a6f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb028727-c8c9-4a56-ac5b-fef16766d868.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"10f92367-e496-41b6-a127-a99f047c04cd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8604f6bd-ca2b-4afb-ac3f-48f9751f92c1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"World Series Baseball 2K2","Overview":"World Series Baseball 2K2, or World Series Baseball as it is known for Xbox, is a sports game developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega for the Dreamcast and Xbox.

After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.\n\nThe fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.\n\nAll these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode.

Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score.\n\nThe game is divided into two types of levels. In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a warehouse. In each of these areas, there are 5 goals to complete. Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this.\n\nThere are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself.

The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player's club has a wealthy benefactor who makes £25m available, in the medium setting £25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available.\n\nHaving started the game and selected a team, the player is presented with the game's main menu. The options here allow the player to access a quick overview of the club's status, fixtures, results and league tables. The main menu also allows the manager to access the transfer market, where players can be bought and sold, and the manager's diary, where messages, such as the success or failure of a transfer bid, are received. It is through the manager's diary that game-time is advanced through to the day of the next match.\n\nOn match day the player selects their team from the available squad, and decides the formation to be used and tactics - long ball, direct or passing - for the upcoming match. The game offers many standard formations as well as offering the player the chance to create their own.\n\nHaving decided how the game is to be played, the player starts the match. As this is a management game, there is no game play video to watch; instead the player receives match highlights as though on a teleprompter. At any time during the game the player can pause the match and change the team's tactics and \/ or make a substitution.\n\nAt the end of the match the player can view a range of stats on individual performance e.t.c.\n\nThe game is entirely mouse controlled, though a keyboard is required when entering names for save games.","Publisher":"On-Line PLC","ReleaseDate":"2001-05-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"11823":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Soukou no Kihei: Space Griffon","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Panther","Images":[{"FileName":"c413f702-cb05-4d17-b466-4910a66c6908.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3ac190d8-a0e0-4875-9f51-96bdf276567c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a27e815a-4ade-47ec-849e-56110e0a4878.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8802d5b-e9fd-48e4-9aa0-2967a95ecfab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9879f207-f262-47ed-8ab5-264937aac4dc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c4dc8309-0d94-4883-8b9a-eedc55b02e3c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Space Griffon VF-9","Overview":"Released in Japan\n\nYou are Kid, the key member of the investigative AMC army, leading five of your comrades in the armored Space Griffon VF9.

The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit.\n\nBesides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.","Publisher":"Sega Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2001-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosmic_Smash"},"14993":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"6b9859a8-1599-42db-a767-cdc1dc97bce2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4d622ade-f8b5-40a1-a96b-f5b62ef23998.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b2d38443-c3ee-41fc-aa8f-967bc53ca52d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ea4e7bd1-6fe5-438c-812c-21cbd413023a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a433529-339c-409f-a819-dabe83f94a74.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"76d7204b-5cb9-495f-8760-271624b2c383.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"904ba6a5-83d5-46a5-919a-a75473274f88.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a603cd5a-2473-48f5-aa26-a36604a97cc3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2ccb35b3-82e5-4540-a8e5-ff1f2a4a661c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f95e2cee-15dd-4ef1-b897-8ead541fc9e3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cb9d16f4-ccb7-42e5-bedc-13fef186b963.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ffb75f3b-c091-4f22-aaa2-0a1daf6dfdf5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"138260c2-ff41-453d-ac86-3ac29950384b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6c60363f-5fb8-4b06-ac40-6de10927e5fb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ab245bfa-8f8b-42a6-bd95-ffc3f20bd342.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001","Overview":"Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, known in Japan as Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001 (カプコン バーサス エス・エヌ・ケイ 2 ミリオネア ファイティング 2001 Kapukon bāsasu Esu-enu-kei Tsū: Mirionea Faitingu Tsū Sausando Wan?), is the sequel to the fighting game Capcom vs. SNK. It was originally released on NAOMI hardware in arcades. As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team.\n\nAspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or \"Ratio\") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game. Additional characters were added, including more characters from Capcom and SNK titles outside of the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. The Groove system from Millennium Fight 2000 has been augmented to include four new systems of play based on various Capcom and SNK fighting games. In addition, the number of buttons has been increased from the Neo Geo standard of four to the six button system first seen in Capcom's Street Fighter.\n\nThe game was initially ported to the Sega Dreamcast, followed by a version for the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and Xbox received an updated version titled Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO, with the \"EO\" referring to \"Easy Operation\", a game option intended for novices to the game.

It was released for the Sega Dreamcast in March 2006. The game takes place in an alternate reality based on World War II, and, in a controversial twist, players control German-speaking characters (under the banner of \"the Empire\"), fighting against enemies (\"the Union\") that speak English and possess weapons patterned after those of both real-life Allied and Axis powers (for example, naval units in Level 2 bear heavy resemblance toward the Imperial Japanese warships). The game was released very late in the life of the Dreamcast, but sold much better than expected, probably because there were no other home ports planned in the foreseeable future.\n\nPlayers assume control of a helicopter, which can be rotated like a more limited version of the mechanism in Zero Gunner 2. Gameplay is largely very traditional, and bears a strong resemblance to some older Toaplan games, especially Twin Cobra. It uses 3D graphics, and a slightly angled perspective to give the game more depth than most other titles in the genre.\n\nOn October 27, 2011, G.rev announced a remake titled Under Defeat HD to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[1] The game is released by Rising Star Games on February 23, 2012 in Japan, November 9, 2012 in the UK and set to be released on November 28, 2012 in North America for PlayStation 3 only and January 25, 2013 in Europe. The Xbox 360 version for North America was released on August 26, 2014 as a downloadable game-only under Games on Demand. An upgraded version of Under Defeat HD (PS3, Xbox 360) was made on Sega Ring Edge 2 arcade System, named Under Defeat HD+. Now that version is coming to arcades with some improvements via Sega’s ALL.NET. Among the enhancements this will have is a horizontal orientation mode, more detail in the battlefield and a “New Order” mode where apparently you can choose from different types of aircraft.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Under_Defeat"},"15005":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Virtua Striker 2 Ver. 2000.1","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Virtua Striker 2 Ver. 2000.1","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"79aac086-d123-42a1-8711-5c25b9fbceaa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"84902991-c99d-4baf-a984-87f1c87e3827.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"acc4c458-57fc-4f67-8e32-32fc0807481b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ddfcae3e-e721-40dc-b189-75a3e7980c58.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1119094b-260c-4533-8873-6e3f96554472.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59fca5a0-2d02-43a3-b239-6843e87447f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3ced5a70-b18e-46f3-b497-c7063ab9e286.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"09a311a1-3a08-40f6-9dd0-6813512b15b2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Virtua Striker 2","Overview":"Perform high-flying bicycle kicks, headers and shoot-outs while hearing the chants of the crowd in this flawless arcade translation.

Armed with only a mighty drill, you'll have to dig your way down to safety before his air supply runs out!\n\nMr. Driller is a real-time puzzle game that relies solely on quick-thinking and a bit of planning. The gameplay is a combination of Tetris and Boulder Dash: You have to drill down through multi-colored blocks to reach the bottom while avoiding the consequences of reckless drilling; blocks left without a foundation will drop down after a while, potentially crushing Mr. Driller. As the hero's air supply is depleted with time, the player must regularly grab oxygen pick-ups. Some of the blocks are \"X-Blocks\", which take a few tries to drill through and take away a large chunk of the player's air if destroyed. If four or more X-Blocks come in contact with each other, they vanish and leave behind a small blue creature \"Chisokojin\", which grants 765 points when picked up.\n\nThere are two scenarios in the game, the \"2500ft\" and \"5000ft challenge\" (called \"500m\" and \"1000m\" in the Japanese version), which are five and ten levels long respectively.","Publisher":"Namco Hometek Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2000-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mr._Driller_(video_game)"},"17597":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Bakumatsu Roman Dai Ni Maku: Gekka no Kenshi Final Edition","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"34a1493d-c283-4b90-8964-9a9e92785254.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cb7c60f6-8636-4e76-b0c4-4966195b028a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c648e0fa-45f2-4b19-8598-4d538e5de2fc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e274dee2-ee72-4b85-a2a7-e8a0c00a617a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5470d6ce-575b-40f4-8575-9e9fb374f8bf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5aea7dd5-b7ea-4f81-bba0-6ba0df8881f8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c7540e8-4513-41e2-b561-a8409d5de78b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"e8c0b769-66b5-48c0-9f6a-f50bc19a1b5a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5d4e6e67-197e-4ae7-8cc0-e563cbe5c139.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8e74bcda-80e3-4663-b835-c630474cd232.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1e6faf17-6269-47a5-8d37-d7907d2d5820.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"05641c19-2d95-460c-b38f-500be4934c06.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6969db0f-c900-47cb-850d-1eb5fdb79672.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"398ca5d3-b308-4458-aaf0-2a8a0d641d0f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai","Overview":"The Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai is a 2D fighting game which features anime-style characters that fight each other with swords, clubs, and even fishing poles.

The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.\n\nUse the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.\n\nYou can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.","Publisher":"Xicat Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charge_%27n_Blast"},"19315":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1d538219-8b11-4567-8c57-3e63b9ad99bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bd8dbbda-5b2a-446e-af5c-6cdde9f3e8d3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6952f292-3989-48c0-a9d4-fa8029f29e30.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3094d617-cc25-4d02-89da-66a4a2658710.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"15817272-7ef9-4388-bc80-8d04f9bacebb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Quest V","Overview":"On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.\n\nAs with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.","Publisher":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased"},"19316":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kalisto Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a717794f-473f-4446-9d92-3b74d9fea525.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"97b1a618-4b70-4e00-83b4-8cabf215d89f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f2e6010f-16e1-4a5d-b696-4f59148ba053.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f4acfd09-a4e5-4bb0-814b-016b64b33a11.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fda4d7d6-1c06-478b-8d0d-de2dbe9c04dd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be6b8dd1-f28e-4b37-84b3-f457721c3996.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"005ede84-e47c-4711-82da-9dc1965fa0b8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8f9d2b39-73d9-41da-9f07-11bc8d637418.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"841e552c-305e-42ef-8235-09df15a14ce6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"79326f1e-8d1d-4756-9e0d-b4e8c142c2a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"25ed334f-b5f0-4413-80cd-227c54c973db.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"4 Wheel Thunder","Overview":"4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the power-boat racing game Hydro Thunder.\n\nIn this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks.

It was developed by the AM2 division of Sega for the Sega Naomi Multiboard arcade system board under the direction of Yu Suzuki, and was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 video game consoles under the names F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa and Ferrari F355 Challenge respectively for both American and European releases. The only model of car featured in the game is the Ferrari F355 Challenge model. The game was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 possible up until that time.\n\nSome versions of the arcade cabinet are noteworthy for having three screens, allowing the player to look through the side windows as they would in a real car. The three-screen cabinet version also features an H-shaped gear stick and three foot pedals, and presents a tough challenge to any player who decides to use them. The cabinet itself is composed of four NAOMI units: one for each of the three screens and one to sync them all. The game also allows the player to use an automatic transmission or paddle-shift the gears. It also uses a real-time \"Magic Weather\" system similar to Shenmue. The Dreamcast version has link cable play for direct competition, however as of Jan. 2006, the online servers for F355 Challenge are now offline, and the website has gone offline.\n\nThe game features an original soundtrack featuring Genki Hitomi and Minoru Niihara that mimics the style of 1980s hard rock\/heavy metal which is integrated into a radio station format during gameplay. The radio DJ (and the announcer) goes by the name of Alan J (the Voice, born 14 July 1959).\n\nYu Suzuki is a keen Ferrari enthusiast who allegedly used data from his own Ferrari 355 at certain tracks to implant in the game during its development.","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2000-08-03T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PlbKbXpDLnw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/F355_Challenge"},"19320":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega AM2","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"e4669bda-4d81-4e1b-8466-219c7eefe3db.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"94349145-bf76-467d-b818-12e04e3bd4ca.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1a3847c6-9c5b-4d15-b4b4-f53d6d803e73.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3541cdc6-7e58-4cc7-ad20-2769477bd97d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4d530737-c0a4-4e28-a14a-64c1abc25c16.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9da58d4e-4f4b-4719-a083-7ed6aafe1752.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b82c3b3-7afb-4325-8dba-23f826c79710.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"590b3176-689c-42fc-ac3b-581b42af7e9f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e2c8ea45-de89-4c2a-9fac-be721e34148a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1608e7da-6236-4ea3-b973-7cb1f961d6c2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4c674345-abe8-4d55-bd26-a44607e64311.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Fighting Vipers 2","Overview":"Fighting Vipers 2 is a 3D fighting video game developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega for their Model 3 arcade board in 1998, and later ported to the Dreamcast in 2001.

Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds.

The two scenarios have different missions, whether it's stopping a runaway cable car, or collecting bombs for disposal.","Publisher":"Virgin Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2000-10-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Runabout:_San_Francisco_Edition"},"29246":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Silicon Dreams Studio","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"13f54377-c449-471c-bf9b-da57a5670a4c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4460d776-a15b-47f1-bab7-381d3e44ebd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b3e635b9-7abd-4d15-b0fd-baa01b2a6a51.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"UEFA Dream Soccer","Overview":"UEFA Dream Soccer is essentially an update of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 (same developer and game engine).

The game's unusual premise is the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning the player takes control of a tiny, newborn creature. The alien world is harsh, so the \"hero\" has to constantly improve, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. To make the new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy...\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective with pre-rendered backgrounds. Since the protagonist is an animal, the game doesn't have any ingame texts; for solving riddles the player is totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution the player will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give the controlled creature energy balls or new abilities required for further progress.\n\nBesides the usual actions like attacking, biting, and talking (or, better to say, communicating) the creature can perform somewhat strange actions such as sleeping and urinating, which are essential to the gameplay.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30097":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acclaim Studios Teesside","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"6a473298-6522-46d2-b6df-a607c9f3abb2.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2ccf0b9a-696d-4b5e-8d4d-b0d034c63d4f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8bef08e2-3398-4788-9a07-10ce98d0e95a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0d3106d0-14d2-44ee-afc1-665481ff1379.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"275fa020-ea3a-41dd-a560-c4be4ab1f841.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e1a19ebe-2f7f-438e-8346-d57956533e0d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"256d6757-aa56-4843-810e-9fa145eb4a38.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26faf333-e2c3-4e55-b809-8167543f6cf3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0472a959-6a4a-42df-b7ec-5a3f960f2024.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a540d03f-3d04-43be-ac1e-96d97d59c82e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4d7f0cd0-2407-46ea-a404-7380498b29eb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"90938574-b2c8-42b6-aa81-5be979364ac4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4eb072f7-a1d7-4f80-8178-6e40169ac713.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"78c6b5c8-824d-4c52-9fc6-2f9743a7588c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"10902cc1-6dbd-4010-9ea4-7da5cf0eecf5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shadow Man","Overview":"You're the Shadow Man, a person who can switch between the world of the dead and of the living.

You play as Alice, a girl who has to save her mother, abducted by a giant raven. As a white rabbit claims it knows the location of the raven's nest you decide to follow it...\n\nThe game features three different worlds with several levels each. Your goal is to reach the exit of the level while avoiding enemy creatures (which can't be killed, and will reduce Alice's hearts — the game's life meter — by one on each contact) or harsh environments (spikes, water or lava, all instantly fatal). In the whole game you deal with locked gates and have to find the matching keys; later worlds will introduce falling platforms that disappear, levers to push in order to open the exit and movable crates that can help Alice reach certain areas. There are two types of mushrooms: one shrinks Alice, the other returns her to the normal size. Mini-Alice can access narrow passageways, but she lacks the force to push crates and her jumps are reduced in height and length. There is no game over, the current level is played from the beginning in case of failure; when starting a new game, it is possible to play from the last stage you previously reached.","Publisher":"HUCAST.net","ReleaseDate":"2015-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=46QdZmUs6fE"},"31200":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"DUX - Version 1.5","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hucast.Net, KonTechs Ltd","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"500333e4-cea9-4eef-9922-c3fd85be9994.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"03c3e0c9-ce65-432d-8d1c-a30774d0ebed.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f841395-cbe1-44e3-bc81-470826967a94.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d1150e2f-354e-4027-b48f-e5c299d5666f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"DUX 1.5","Overview":"DUX Version 1.5 features new re-balanced gameplay as well as a brand new 16-bit soundtrack created by Andre Naumann and Marco Groß DUX is better than ever!\n\nGet yourself back into the high-res bullet-spraying action with insta-respawns.

While their stories start separately, their paths cross when they uncover the truth behind the bombing and how it all ties to a secret corporation known as NAX.\n\nJuly is more of a visual novel where player advances through dialogues and choices, and travels to different locations, than typical adventure with clickable objects and inventory items. The map is a big part of interface and chooses many locations that player can visit as events are triggered by visiting the right place at the right time. The game uses anime style character art with pre-rendered backgrounds and occasional pre-rendered animated cut-scenes. There is no voice-acting, however, neither for player characters nor for NPCs.","Publisher":"Fortyfive Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"92784":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team Ninja","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"d5ecdfb0-3455-4eec-9062-052987981d23.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"1c208de8-8b28-46ff-8990-b08fee4a15af.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"979e8f9b-c753-40f1-827c-5ea978f322a3.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea6f5133-06b9-4a3b-8a26-23b160c63b3f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dead or Alive 2: Limited Edition","Overview":"Dead or Alive 2 (Japanese: デッドオアアライブ2 Hepburn: Deddo Oa Araibu 2, abbreviated as DOA2) is a fighting game in the Dead or Alive series, developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo.

A sequel titled Ninth Will was announced shortly after the game's North American release, but it was apparently cancelled.\n\nThe theme of Seventh Cross is evolution. The player begins with a protist, and through eating and consuming, progresses through two other stages until it becomes an animal. The game begins in a lagoon, where the player's organism must avoid predators while nourishing itself. If the creature dies, it is returned to its lowest form unless it has successfully evolved into its 'origin' stage, in which case the creature regresses to that instead. After death, any parts gained by evolution are kept, but any gathered food is lost.\n\nSeventh Cross contains six stages, each with a boss. The stages take place in different biomes, ranging from the pond to a barren future.","Publisher":"UFO Interactive Games","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1999,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seventh_Cross:_Evolution"},"127942":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Altron Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"cfa45051-769f-4e8d-97f9-973642962d58.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1923c976-638f-4708-b969-429387bc0392.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"936dbed3-d731-4827-a5cc-5318012f1d7c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7f982943-a4ae-4d28-82bf-d79fb18e2370.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d190069b-87d4-4102-8b6c-fdd1d522fc86.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"705d21f9-5868-4056-9531-6b6f77b82e81.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"30cc85ad-61ec-4f0c-98e6-845735a14c0f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3de9bc0d-d156-4f51-83e7-6d989407ca57.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Cleopatra Fortune","Overview":"Cleopatra Fortune is a 1997 falling-block puzzle game featuring an anime Egyptian theme. Groups of stones and gems of different shapes fall from the top of a well. Gems can be cleared by enclosing them within a group of stones, and stones can be cleared by making complete rows from them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points.\n\nThe game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra's friends who have been trapped in a pyramid by the evil Sphinx.\n\nFollowing the initial arcade release in 1997, a PlayStation version and a Sega Saturn version were released in Japan, followed later by the Dreamcast version in 2001. A PlayStation version was released in the USA and Europe in 2003.  An arcade only sequel called Cleopatra Fortune Plus was released later in 2001, on the Sega NAOMI system. Both the Dreamcast port and this new sequel were created in association with Altron instead of Natsume.","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"2001-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?reload=9&v=dXRTdzoIR6c","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cleopatra_Fortune"},"128026":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Takuyo","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f51071ec-9c7e-4e60-b3d6-25d92830e033.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2f67fa52-1cb0-466e-85c3-5247771384e5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"378c943d-5f63-48d4-94ec-e7aaaf53122f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7bd4360-07e6-4ce8-9ea2-f154e5a508bc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fragrance Tale","Overview":"Fragrance Tale (フレグランス テイル) is an adventure game for the Sega Dreamcast.","Publisher":"Takuyo","ReleaseDate":"2001-07-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"128043":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"S+F Software","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"575e3c38-acc8-4075-85f5-a0fbba3706f8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9a45f856-c15b-4288-9cbc-9a994fd8dc74.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cea0b838-e4cb-463f-9e8c-98cb43de98f8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29b74116-f5bb-42d6-945f-5405010b0445.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f9562019-b9ea-4d2b-825a-0c538ebcb322.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"eeab0a3d-4353-49c8-a2e9-1191f221f8c1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Inhabitants","Overview":"Inhabitants is a puzzle game that will put your skills to the test as you work your way through level after level of tile clearing action!

Prince Larf thus battles his way back to his sweetheart. The 3D real-time strategy game was originally created for Sega's Japanese fiber optic service net@, then ported to the Dreamcast but never released outside of Japan. Ported once more to the PC, Hundred Swords finally reached North America and Europe.\n\nSingle soldiers? Don’t bother. You control complete units of five to 20 men gathering round a commander. Micro-management is reduced, instead it’s paper, scissors, stone: cavalry is strong against mages, mages are strong against infantry, and so on. Officers can recruit new soldiers in barracks, as long as your mines supply enough of two resources. Your tasks on the small 3D playfields vary from flight to defence to all-out attack, sometimes with time limits. Depending on your success, you are awarded shells, magical items that can be equipped to the commanders and activated in battle for a short-term benefit. Commanders will also gain experience, making them tougher and able to control more soldiers.\n\nIn the single-player campaign, anime stills and 3D cut-scenes tell the story of prince Larf and his gang. When the adventure’s through, a mission mode let’s you play single battles with units not available in the main storyline. Up to four players can also link together via network or internet and test their skill against each other.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hundred_Swords"},"136058":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ecco II: Sentinels of the Universe","Region":"World"},{"AlternateName":"Ecco: Sentinels of the Universe","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Appaloosa Interactive","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Adventure; Puzzle; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"029baad7-953b-4d40-9c0f-71061c51bb00.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d56475e1-3808-4d99-8db0-7ad1708c337c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"48a73ffe-2838-49eb-b480-e40089099f24.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"41b5950d-79b1-49e7-8c61-f18b4f3a2c7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"420360ed-398e-4b58-99a6-a881da7fde5a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ecco the Dolphin II: Sentinels of the Universe","Overview":"Ecco II: Sentinels of the Universe is an unreleased Sega Dreamcast sequel to Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future‎, presumably developed by Appaloosa Interactive and set to be published by Sega.\n\nLittle is known about this game - an early prototype (and source code) dated the 23rd of February 2001 was found on a Dreamcast Dev.Box but shows very little of what the game was meant to entail.

Entertainment. It is based on the 2000 film of the same name, itself based on Hanna-Barbera's The Flintstones franchise. This Dreamcast adaptation was a kart racer, similar to others at the time, featuring various characters and environments from the movie. A notable thing is that, while based on a live-action movie, the game's look is more in line with that of the original Flintstones cartoons, as well as powerups being obtained through knocking bowling pins, also a nod towards the show.\n\nWhile this Dreamcast version was cancelled, a sample version, likely intended for the press, has since surfaced. Had it been released, it likely would've come out in late 2000, or early 2001. While it is not known if the game was meant to see release outside of Europe, the presence of Conspiracy Entertainment in the opening logos means it's likely that they would've been the North American publishers.\n\nA Viva Rock Vegas game was eventually released by Swing! in mid-2001 for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Europe, but while it also is a kart racer, it is a completely different game from this Dreamcast adaptation. It was developed by Toka and features a graphical style more in line with the movie, as well as different gameplay and other elements. Interestingly said version was planned to have a Japanese release by Idea Factory, but while that didn't happen, the game itself still mentions the company, oddly. Another Viva Rock Vegas game, also by Swing!, was planned for the GameCube, in development by Zombie Studios, but this was also cancelled.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased"},"137465":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc.","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"8e20c46a-320c-4ae1-8e2f-5b4684f8026d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"db976d9e-36a8-4de9-869b-4d56fbf0379c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e32d886-2dac-42d2-962b-e97f02956d4e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"aea0055f-85f8-478c-a152-e9d579ecb827.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"373853c2-85f4-4e3f-b516-397a679b3756.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d4899b5e-7962-47bc-9687-bb97162f240c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix: Dreamcast Edition","Overview":"This is the second rendition of the popular dance simulation.

The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puyo_Puyo~n"},"138764":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Senile Team","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"2dd21453-5dd7-4ca3-b284-9ea6404caf8a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a3e73665-5abf-4867-86e4-7a4ec63c4d3a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"189054a6-5374-4ac5-8eb6-447dc2503485.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a56323a-5705-4e3e-8674-c19efb7774ed.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"030ea043-dbc5-4a92-88c5-865d9a0e7c91.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Rush Rush Rally Racing","Overview":"Rush Rush Rally Racing, also known as R4, is an independently developed, commercially released video game developed by Senile Team and published by RedSpotGames.

Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.\n\nThe game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special \"boss\" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.\n\nEach player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.","Publisher":"SNK Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2000-03-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twinkle_Star_Sprites"},"138769":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"c74d5643-21b3-4c54-9f3b-5079571e6257.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"281e8664-fa4f-49bf-b4bf-fad99cff134c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"366268d9-5c83-46eb-b3bf-ac08d6bc41a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a7c3c7f5-9743-4d2a-8b4e-62adf5ec282a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"28105a67-a50e-4dd9-8da1-3c7af46a895d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Puyo Puyo Da!

Behind each waypoint you will usually find a puzzle, but you may also discover a minigame or other special locations (like shops). The stages are connected with a funny and self-ironic storyline, among others containing the developers of the game as the protagonists.\n\nApart from the story mode the game also features an arcade and an puzzle mode, the first one enabling you to play alone, against a friend or the CPU, the later offering preset playfields, which have to be cleared within a limited number of moves.\n\nFor the Dreamcast version of the game it was possible to pre-order a custom sprite character which can be unlocked in the game.","Publisher":"RedSpotGames","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wind_and_Water:_Puzzle_Battles"},"139365":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Takuyo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4644ad25-8f9c-4c59-ae87-db16c765326f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f4f72b5f-f5a1-4a7f-ba69-b167cf82f326.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"96fc5dd7-8a4e-42db-a30b-1863bd65679d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fd17d459-70ae-4a52-a7a6-a22ad847814b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"257176c7-80ab-4cc7-8b28-43c646acc134.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2c54f37c-25c8-4282-81e3-ac70a51f3cda.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Plus Plumb","Overview":"Plus Plum is an action puzzle game released in Japan in 1999 and published by Takuyo.

A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.\n\nIn Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.\n\nIn the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and \"myst\" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on \"CASTLE\", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the \"ERRANTRY\" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.\n\nIn the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the \"LONGINUS\" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the \"BEAST\" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the \"HOLY GRAIL\" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.","Publisher":"Success Corp.","ReleaseDate":"2000-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"140216":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Volgarr the Viking","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Crazy Viking Studios","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6a16a41e-082f-4175-a8d5-fe7bec670926.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"debd8ebe-6b9b-4295-96b4-2e099ce712a1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ff98a97d-b943-498e-9858-7bc1ddd84a0d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Völgarr the Viking","Overview":"In Völgarr the Viking, the player controls the titular character, who has been charged by Odin with a quest to defeat an evil dragon.

Treasure chests located throughout the level will contain power-ups that will grant Völgarr new abilities and, most importantly, enable him to take more damage. In his initial state, Völgarr can sustain a single unblocked hit at the cost of his shield, and a second hit will force the player to return to the last checkpoint, either the beginning of the level or the midpoint of the level.

The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings. \n\nWhen playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and right. As the game's level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it's an arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and the symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player will get a large bonus. \n\nThe two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are activated by clearing lines. Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks will fall while clearing three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four lines) stacked lines will rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple lines that are apart from each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack that knocks out the opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a four player mode where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be played online.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"141515":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sonic Team","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"ac36ccc0-58d6-49f5-a040-0fcee21b321b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"78a5998d-211f-4ae4-a087-66c5e634185b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bdf4907d-00bd-460d-9423-8d7c8b0f0563.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e6be6a4a-bf25-4c93-b406-8e709a37d245.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5ea4293c-a034-4bcd-a3cc-9a4d478e7081.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ca2db0de-7cd0-4fa2-b9fe-a6e402b78809.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sonic Adventure International","Overview":"Sonic Adventure International is a Japanese exclusive re-release of the original Sonic Adventure.

This being said, the game is actually influenced by Street Fighter Alpha and the Darkstalkers franchise, with most Street Fighter II characters missing. Though characters from both series appear in the game they are not controllable by the player, acting solely as avatars.\n\nSimilar to other \"falling piece\" puzzle games, the aim of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is to eliminate your opponent by filling their playfield with blocks (or gems, in this case). In order to achieve this, you must eliminate coloured gems on your side of the play area and produce combos when doing so.\n\nAs well as a Saturn port, the game was brought to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 for Capcom's Matching Service.

While using power-ups to combat enemies, players seek to collect the twelve \"Sacred Albums of Funk\" and defeat the antagonistic \"Anti-Funk\".\n\nThe original two ToeJam & Earl games were a key Sega Genesis franchise, but development of a third game was prevented by the poor North American commercial performance of the console's successor, the Sega Saturn. Versions of ToeJam & Earl III developed at different times for the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast were canceled, but the latter was completed for the Xbox. On release, the game met with poor sales and mixed reviews; while certain critics found its gameplay innovative, its humor, soundtrack and graphics were variously praised and derided. Opinions of the game's overall enjoyability and longevity were also mixed.\n\nThe game has been called both a platform game[2] and an action-adventure game.[9] GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron,[9] while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game.[10][11] The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control one of the three protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks, but is slow and jumps lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game.[7] In the game's two-player mode, the camera moves between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.[7]\n\nThe game's randomly generated levels are connected together by hubs.[8] Additional levels can be downloaded from Xbox Live.[7] Level exploration is based around collecting items: the player searches for the Sacred Albums of Funk, and for keys that grant access to more levels.[2][12] Enemies include rabbit ninja, a \"demented chicken\",[2] and \"psycho cheerleaders\",[8] which the player combats with Funk-Fu and Funk Notes. Funk Notes are projectiles that render enemies \"funkified\", or harmless;[8] more powerful than Funk-Fu, they require the player to gather ammunition.[2] The player may also find wrapped presents, which contain power-ups such as rocket skates, spring shoes and food;[9] these variously grant greater defensive abilities, access to certain areas, and additional health.[7] Another power-up involves a simple rhythm game, and leaves nearby enemies \"funkified\" if the player successfully copies on-screen rhythms.[8]"},"143123":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Neppachi V: CR Monster House"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Falcon","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"3a2670c1-e34e-4167-ae0a-4db259f91041.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"da8465f9-4d62-41b0-ad32-5910e395a14d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"96b031b9-db1c-420f-86fa-d4436d354f8f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"89d13357-7da9-4868-8a24-67f7dcc0ec94.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2000b99-afc9-46ba-b80c-76e231b5498c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Neppachi V @VPACHI: CR Monster House","Overview":"Neppachi V @VPACHI: CR Monster House (ネッパチⅤ＠VPACHI ～CRモンスターハウス～) is a pachinko game for the Sega Dreamcast.","Publisher":"Daikoku Denki","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"145470":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Horny Dog","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e8594aeb-bcb7-4b2d-a1ce-ec6be25a86d9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8d1fbece-5c91-4499-83d4-d85ec77dfd99.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hellgate","Publisher":"Jester Interactive","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MWHvn5UjESo"},"146552":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Overworks","Genres":"Adventure; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"a116d669-6b1f-442b-a078-b5a887d67fd0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ef0970f8-4b5e-4784-bce3-03cf92ae26b1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2ce5977-e827-4066-a190-4ca0ab8e6d67.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d1d83fd2-c3cb-48b2-9064-9ffd5f2cb152.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8f2445fb-94ec-4c53-991a-f7fcbf672144.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"06ec717e-566b-45f9-a63b-546e8b05fe96.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4d4b4ac1-f2c0-4c11-a38e-346dbcd3f41b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sakura Taisen","Overview":"It is the Taishou Era in Japan, and the Western world has begun to make its way through traditional Japan. Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.\n\nAnd, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichiro Ogami's life is about to take a very interesting turn as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ichiro now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.\n\nThe gameplay of Sakura Taisen is a combination of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, which serves as a disguise for the military base. Depending on the player's decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - the protagonist will develop different relationships with the girls, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also slightly affect their parameters in battles. During combat, the player navigates Ichiro and the girls over an isometric battlefield and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn it is possible to perform two different actions per character; walking distance and attack range are limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment in the game.","Publisher":"Sega Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2000-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sakura_Wars"},"146553":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega AM7 R&D Division","Genres":"Adventure; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"0fdf6b97-ffbe-4762-9d7a-70bf314d1ac3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8c1326b4-160d-474c-bbac-702175464bb8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"749851ed-fd07-4c3c-a154-71f7b01ee3ba.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6e89c48-12a0-43bd-b3ad-949bca187a68.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e9415617-211d-43f8-974c-168b5aeb038c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f2a5e996-2060-4080-8a13-aff1c87b2606.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2cf93661-cff0-4377-83bd-97763a2dd9f6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sakura Taisen 2: Kimi, Shinitamou Koto Nakare","Overview":"Sakura Taisen 2: Kimi, Shinitamou Koto Nakare (lit. \"You Shall Not Die\"), takes place in a renewed Teito Tokyo (\"Imperial Capital Tokyo\"), one years after Hanagumi Squad Leader Ichirou Ohgami returned to the Imperial Navy.

While it can’t be directly compared to any contemporary game the mental skills required by the puzzles put them somewhere in between \"Picross\" and \"Bejeweled\" – and in our humble opinion they can easily stand up against those games.\n\nAll puzzles are embedded in a big and complex overworld full of exploration and humorous citizens constructed entirely using beautifully hand-drawn pixel graphics. Exploration and puzzle-solving is intertwined in clever and varied ways which draw you deeper into the game world.","Publisher":"Signo & Arte","ReleaseDate":"2016-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uP4vMOxmp7k"},"156216":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"ギアナリターンズ","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"RetroGuru","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"d61d5af6-b385-4b11-80f5-22a29eca3ac3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49393043-879d-4f21-b166-41bfb82dc433.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cae14831-7523-4295-8941-1b03d8e5ebda.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f766f41-46a4-4fb6-b70c-722ba716ce45.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Giana's Return","Overview":"Evil Swampy and his followers have stolen the magic ruby, which made it once possible for Giana and Maria to return from their dream.

But in order to playback the memories of the soul, it is necessary to have someone in your heart who you really want to meet. And so the story flashback to the memories of high-school when you were in third year and play until the day of your accident. Second part start with Yuuichi waking up in a hospital. But not is his own body, but rather in that of whomever you made heroine in the first part of the story. Your soul is sort-of possessing that person's body. You want to tell people you know that you are still alive somehow, but because you are not really you, it appears to be rather difficult feat to achieve. But it is a matter of time when the soul decides to merge, and because two souls cannot forever occupy the same body, the one that doesn't merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges, he will continue to live on in this body.\n\nThis visual novel plays just as typically, you read through the text with static backgrounds and non-animated characters and occasionally make choices that may propel the story toward a certain direction. There are also unlockable CG scenes and background music which can be viewed from gallery.\n\nDreamcast and PlayStation 2 ports feature some new characters and scenarios which are not present in PC version.","Publisher":"Pionesoft","ReleaseDate":"2004-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157795":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HuneX Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"4d070eec-4b21-4bc9-a885-5910e0c489b2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3e506378-02ea-40f9-96eb-6b378d6660a4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"95a6f822-58c1-4192-aa48-286591f20e16.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aikagi: Hidamari to Kanojo no Heyagi","Overview":"Aikagi: Hidamari to Kanojo no Heyagi (あいかぎ 〜ひだまりと彼女の部屋着〜) is a Sega Dreamcast visual novel.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2003-08-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157796":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Key","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d3fa29a0-c532-4d5e-829c-1815a7dba2f2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fc7a3d46-50a7-4df8-91c6-1eb64fead8c0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"767b3420-456e-46bd-8401-29fe2982ba7a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05e24c7f-3c40-4cc2-b68c-cb6bd24005cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2a4b4b9d-59df-4347-8c6f-5fa8cb95e81a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Air","Overview":"Air for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 is a console port of an adult visual novel with the same name that was first released as Air as a PC title.

You, on the other hand, desperately want to prove yourself in the area, but your inspiration is as dry as an empty well. So, you decide to take those three weeks of holidays to return to your hometown and give your best to come up with something solid or completely give up on wanting to become a picture book writer. Your hometown is a couple of hours from Tokyo by bullet train, though it is a rather rural area so it requires a switch to a more local train. Upon your arrival, you soon team up with Erina, an old friend of yours, and the two of you keep on exploring town, going places an meeting people. One night, walking alone in the woods, you get caught by the rain. Running to find a shelter, you stumble upon a small shrine. There, in front of your eyes, you see a flying silhouette which soon gets zapped by the thunder and falls down not far from where you are. Not sure what you saw really happened, you come outside and see a small fairy, down on the ground under the rain and with a wounded wing. You pick her up and tend to her wound. She quickly tests her fixed wings and flies away with a smile. As the morning comes, you look over town and has a sudden vision of an unknown place. Whatever happened to you granted you certain magical abilities you are not aware of.\n\nThe game takes place in your hometown which represents reality, and a fantasy Layer world. In either world you can freely move around the map and talk to various characters you run along the way. Your hometown is split into six districts and different events and characters can be seen at different time of the day (morning, noon, evening, or night). When in Layer world, whenever important advance is being made, a battle scene which takes action on a separate combat arena will occur. The battle itself is real-time and consists of you trying to throw objects or use attacks against the boss. During adventure mode, when entering certain area from the map, the gameplay will resemble that of a regular visual novel with static backgrounds and character stills over it, varying in poses to emphasize their disposition. As dialogues are often short, dialogue choices are not used, but occasional actions you can perform are offered depending on the time and location.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2001-04-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157799":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"AKI","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"726f4580-b2ba-424e-903e-62f33c18aad3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c05aadb4-9219-4941-9ddb-7e66a4e9b741.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"369d7b99-1400-4c8c-8634-8a8ca9f7a719.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"072bd4de-06e1-4d7e-9bdb-b98dab376eaa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Animastar","Overview":"Animastar (アニマスター) is an RPG for the Sega Dreamcast.\n\nAnimastar was originally planned to be compatible with a Game Boy Color Animastar game (which became Animastar GB, released in 2001).

Each episode lasts one minute.\n\n3) It was impossible to watch all the episodes at once - they opened gradually. From October 1, 1999 to October 2000, it was necessary to connect Dreamcast to the Internet every day and download special save files on the VMU that opened new episodes.\n\n\nThe servers went offline shortly after. Now it is necessary to use a special VMU save or directly extract the videos of the gdi disc image to watch the film.\n\n\nThe sequels of Grauen no Torikago were only available to consumers who had finished previous chapters, making later entries exceedingly rare.\n\n\nThe main character of Grauen no Torikago is a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Nao Tsunoda. Recently, she decided to start living separately from her parents - and moved to Tokyo’s Grauenheim apartment complex. But one day, Nao’s life turns into a nightmare when she suddenly discovers the headless corpse of her neighbor (Erica Shimizu) on the roof of the house.\n\nAnd having entered a neighbor's apartment, Nao sees an even more eerie scene: music from the opera Faust plays in the room, and Erica’s severed head hangs from the ceiling and makes strange howling sounds! The killer snapped the girl's head and connected it through a hose to the gas pipe so that the head “sang” to the music from the CD player ... But why did the killer do it? Just out of a desire to mock the corpse, or is there a secret meaning in its actions?\n\nSoon the chain of brutal murder continues - and it becomes clear that a psychopath is hunting the inhabitants of Grauenheim. Moreover, it not only kills people, but also disfigures their corpses so that they carry a certain symbolism in themselves. Will our heroine be able to unravel this symbolism and reveal the identity of the killer, or is she destined to become another victim of a maniac?","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1999-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157827":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Overworks","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"142b86ec-f17f-443b-bcaf-44550b91059b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e458dcb8-eae9-48ab-bdc6-17c5e5a8e4c3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"57d80431-b18e-403c-a617-786425479903.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8349ee81-92b8-4854-b48d-4c5d0d49553b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Guru Guru Onsen 2","Overview":"Guru Guru Onsen 2 (ぐるぐる温泉２) is a table game for the Sega Dreamcast and Windows PCs, the Windows version appropriately being titled Guru Guru Onsen 2 for Windows (ぐるぐる温泉２ for Windows).","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2001-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157828":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Overworks","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"3bcbc4a5-021c-4804-af4a-16359d3004af.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7e1b2e84-d56f-429d-a867-b57a67ace5f0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cf1a0f2d-7cbb-42b1-b888-8cdb555f7e3a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"673c491c-4e29-4e07-a217-c97c5276ed06.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Guru Guru Onsen 3","Overview":"Guru Guru Onsen 3 (ぐるぐる温泉３) is a table game for the Sega Dreamcast.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157834":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"HAPPY★LESSON 〜ファーストレッスン〜","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Happy Lesson: First Lesson"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fupac","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"dfff0b74-cbdd-4fb6-aea4-0df5c7ea2169.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a9a624fb-8c0c-47c8-9f81-59c5e50d0e7e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c571de54-b7a3-45ff-b254-2a165bbe4214.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"72688b98-4b28-44ab-922c-6eaac5a5483e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e98480c7-df23-469f-a537-3b92b57b0801.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Happy Lesson","Overview":"Happy Lesson is a visual novel adventure game based on the manga with the same name which also spanned anime TV series.

An upgraded edition of the game, Federation vs. Zeon DX (DX stands for \"Deluxe\"), includes 360-degree, zero-G space battlefields. Both versions were later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 game consoles.\n\nThe game follows the Universal Century (UC) Gundam time line and takes place during the infamous One Year War. The player is able to pilot various mobile suits and characters from the original Mobile Suit Gundam television series. There are three gaming modes: Arcade mode, Versus mode, and Campaign mode. Arcade mode allows to select two mobile suits depending on the side of the conflict chosen (Earth Federation or Principality of Zeon). The first mobile suit chosen is used for ground combat, while the second one is used in space environments. Versus mode allows two players to play on the same or opposing sides, with various maps and mobile suits available to choose from. The Campaign mode is centered on a player named soldier in the One Year War who combats the opposing side. Although in Campaign mode different mobile suits are unlocked as the campaign progresses. New mobile suits can be received by participating in test missions that involve that particular mobile suit. Exceptions are any captured enemy mobile suits, the Project V units (Gundam, Guntank, and Guncannon), as well as all of Char Aznable's mobile suits (Zaku II, Z'Gok, Gelgoog, and Zeong). \n\nOnce Campaign Mode is defeated once, Extra Mode is unlocked, in which the player is granted top-notch allied mobile suits and all mobile suits from the opposing side as well (i.e. a Zeon pilot can use GM, a Federation suit). However, the AI becomes much harder than normal mode and if a suit is destroyed, it is not replaced. Also awarded when beating the regular Campaign Mode is the availability of all Mobile Suits in Versus and Arcade Modes.","Publisher":"Bandai Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2002-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_Suit_Gundam:_Federation_vs._Zeon"},"165171":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Card of Destiny: Hikari to Yami no Tougousha","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Card of Destiny: Hikari to Yami no Tougoumono","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Abel Software","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"0769ca3c-d15c-49ad-85d9-cba233800d22.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"47e79026-e1f8-4f61-891f-79419109c7db.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0fce362b-18b9-4b05-a29f-a8e8270bd905.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e328e63e-a0be-450c-8219-06a56dc5fe56.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2ce91667-f162-4cc5-9905-8ad105a63dea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e1de610c-224b-402c-bef0-c69b31da9701.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Card of Destiny: Hikari to Yami no Tougou Mono","Overview":"Card of Destiny: Hikari to Yami no Tougou Mono is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Abel Software, which was released in Japan in 2002.","Publisher":"Abel Software","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"165689":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"World Neverland Plus: Olerud Oukoku Monogatari"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Riverhillsoft","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"086631b6-2a07-440f-b2f6-1eb90a1b06e0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"129a5926-68a1-4e5a-ae8e-fff0c3aaf7b0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8993c126-beed-49cc-9e9f-8d5efee7171b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a6127164-5a88-4fa5-85c3-6991506059ea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8927d28-8490-42fb-86ed-96c0206e1650.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"World Neverland Plus: Orurudo Oukoku Monogatari","Publisher":"Riverhillsoft","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-15T00:00:00-08:00"},"165691":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"87432b15-e6fa-4464-a661-34f4029be2c5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1bce4b18-f4cb-4f36-abf7-26597663c396.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"13646863-b342-4948-ba52-99caec269aed.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2064b876-5373-42d6-b900-d22b4c5f30bc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Super Producers: Mezase Show Biz Kai","Overview":"Super Producers: Mezase Show Biz Kai (スーパープロデューサーズ 目指せショウビズ界) is a Sega Dreamcast simulation game.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-11T00:00:00-08:00"},"165692":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"10d8e143-3ac1-47f8-ad33-5eba68ae4268.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6dc039c1-7e17-4ba1-9775-d04b3324ee5b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a04acb92-1023-440d-9117-79ddff4c09fb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7dfa172e-c656-4a77-8d8a-a563788039c6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9ba5b9b-47b5-4c9d-b1ed-c24429b4b92b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Marionette Company","Overview":"Marionette Company 2 is a direct sequel to Marionette Company and you play as a same high-school student from the original.

While you can change her appearance with different outfit or skin and hair color, that will not change her personality or the ability to reason or understand or act differently.

Your name is Takuya Kirishima, and you lived up to your expectations and became a skilled surgeon who can perform any surgery without a problem. But patients still die, and you may not be able to save them all... that brings the lack of confidence in you as a doctor and makes you question your goal to become a doctor.

At such time, a murder occurs at the hospital and people start suffering from an unknown strange disease. The police investigation into it has been launched which yields many suspects and mysteries, and even more questions.\n\nGameplay \nAt its core, this is a visual novel adventure which determines the course of the story based on the choices you make. However, you can also set the mood of your character to trusting, normal, or suspicious, which will also affect the course of the game (quite similar to how it was done in Blade Runner). You will also be able to check the human relation chart to see connection between characters, as well as flow chart to see how the game story branched.","Publisher":"PrincessSoft","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-27T00:00:00-08:00"},"168358":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"839a466e-e4fb-4204-bfba-25e523279d9a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2d2f98db-b0a3-40ee-a058-d6461f52c93f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92475e1e-ba8b-4455-99f6-acabd375fec7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"940ea237-91d1-4726-9554-9230d6843d69.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"}],"Name":"Capcom Taisen Fan","Overview":"Not on sale by itself, but came with the original release of Capcom vs SNK 2 for people who preordered it, making it a bit of a curiosity for DC devotees.

Key moments feature special CG artwork to emphasize certain scene and break out from a typical \"character sprite over background art\" presentation. Aside from main characters, all the heroines feature full voice-acting.

Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage.

The biggest change is the introduction of a battle mode selection system, allowing the player to choose one of four different styles to alter their character's gameplay. Forest is a balanced style which behaves like the rules of the previous game, with the player able to store up to three levels of super meter; Wind limits the player to only two levels of meter, but fills the meter more quickly; Mountain starts the player off with additional meter at the penalty of filling meter more slowly; and Fire allows the player to fill their meter to 4 but limits the maximum level of defensive attack to 2. Two additional modes are unlockable after completing certain story modes: Shadow, which starts with the player's meter completely full but with a major penalty to refilling it; and Lightning, which allows the player to fill their attack meter to 4 and grants a major boost to the speed at which they fill it, but prevents the player from using any defensive options at all.\n\nThe visual novel story mode follows a similar plot to the first game, but this time focuses on a production of Shonen Red vs. Benitokage with the characters competing for the role of Shonen Red. An extra unlockable story mode becomes available once the player has unlocked the four secret characters and focuses on them specifically.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2000-01-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"174233":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Heisei Mahjong-shou"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micronet","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"baa7b37e-834d-4231-92b1-590b439d4525.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0f845ae1-adec-4194-bc31-f8559e5c3e33.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"58f98327-f6bc-41ae-9f86-9b2bbaa4aab8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6fdc7b38-576b-4c0b-851f-1c6c29f45d98.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ecacdaa0-9857-47ab-8db3-2ba3224f486c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2094594c-cae6-43b5-8c3a-f0bbe10c52a2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Heisei Mahjong Sou","Overview":"Heisei Mahjong Sou (平成麻雀荘) is a mahjong game for the Sega Dreamcast.","Publisher":"Micronet","ReleaseDate":"2000-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"174234":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dazz","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7ad6fc11-c8e8-4e51-af9e-7e0b83f6e6e5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a44d8f7d-908e-4a01-b8fd-344847261ab7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c4b794fe-2e13-4587-af14-a1450bebc1df.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7feaccd3-2cd7-427c-94e6-5f54d278d197.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a0a736ff-da10-4757-a385-1e3664500d50.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b1c91dce-b881-4ccf-a371-907eaac42f58.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dd55e6de-381f-4372-b0ef-d93e8f49a0bc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lake Masters Pro Dreamcast Plus!","Overview":"Lake Masters Pro Dreamcast plus!

Playing on the events of the fateful summer in 1972, you take control of youngest brother Mike as he is thrown through the air, and at certain points in his flight path you get the option to alter his course either left or right. By judging where the randomly positioned older brothers are located at the bottom of the screen, you get thrown back into the air and repeat the process. Every time you successfully land on one of the brothers, you gain a point. Miss though, and you land in a crumpled heap on the grass and receive one broken limb. Land three times...and it's game over. As Ben succinctly put it - you only have two arms! Arm is pretty basic in other respects - it has only one screen and simplistic (albeit authentic) sound effects, but it does feature VMU graphics and VGA support.","Publisher":"Ben Lancaster","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2012},"174240":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ben Lancaster","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0d6136fe-0a2e-4acf-a19f-a32347dfe741.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d6470a5-ad97-457a-afba-ce7d9481f367.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"James & Watch: Tooth Cracker","Overview":"As the name suggests, Tooth Cracker is once again based on the Nintendo Game & Watch and so features some fairly rudimentary graphics and sound effects. This shouldn't put you off though, as what worked in the 1980s still holds true today in this age of HD graphics and complex narratives - addictive gameplay and high scores are what made the Game & Watch a winner, and Tooth Cracker nails the formula with aplomb.\n\nGameplay is simple in the extreme - the cans move randomly along the line of teeth at the top of the screen, and when the moving fist below the can lines up you need to hit the action button. Line them up perfectly and you crack a tooth; miss and you lose a life. Each tooth takes three accurate hits with the can of Doggingtons' finest before shattering and if you get all of the teeth smashed you'll receive an extra life. As you get better at hitting the A button as the fist and the can line up, you'll be knocking teeth out for fun; but be aware that the game tempo speeds up as you progress meaning you're in for some pretty frantic reaction-based gameplay. There are two games modes (titled A and B), and the second mode introduces rotten black teeth that only require one direct hit to reduce them to putrid piles of black dust.","Publisher":"Ben Lancaster","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2016},"174259":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"14358f17-4775-4abf-b198-6115a192c433.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c283f253-7413-4f92-ba13-f51ca0bdc864.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Beats of Rage Collection: Volume 1","Overview":"Beats of Rage\nMegaman War of the Past\nRoad Rash Revolution\nKill Ryu Volume 1\nKill Ryu Volume 2\nJoe and Mac Caveman Ninja","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"174260":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"99bbaa2f-59ef-4fdb-8abf-b5c6ce8e02c4.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8ad308e5-0ca3-4c5a-b6d0-06331666f907.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Beats of Rage Collection: Volume 2","Overview":"Beats of Rage Xtra\nDouble Dragon Extreme (Plus Version)\nDragon of Rage DC\nHatchet Ninjaz (Ex Version)\nHyper Final Fight 1 (v2)\nHyper Final Fight 2 (v2)\nRage of Streets (v5)\nAlien Vs Predator: Aftermath\nBeats of Rage Remixed","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"174261":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"40c1f27f-87ee-4311-bfb9-9b06ef82c6f8.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"29874e41-a9ac-4782-a580-cd08fc2409fb.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Beats of Rage Collection: Volume 3","Overview":"Bare Knuckle: The Next Generation\nName Sailor V Code\nFinal Fight: The Last Round (Special Edition)\nGolden Ax: Arcade Remake (Remix)\nPOW: Arcade Remake\nReturn of Double Dragon\nRyuko o NKen Nekketsu WII\nSuper Fightin' Spirit (Fixed)","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"174263":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"D2 Shock","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Warp","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"04593747-6ee1-4a17-a9fb-d3ae992a4311.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"D2 Shock Demo","Overview":"This is a demo version of Warp's Dreamcast game D2. \n\nIn Japan, a demonstration version of D2 was packaged with another Warp-produced game, the Dreamcast remake of the Sega Saturn title Real Sound: Kaze no Regret.

Landing on a property square opens up the option of purchasing it. Essentially, the player is joining the landlord class and may eventually build stores on his\/her plots of land which doubles the rent other players have to pay if they land on it. Hoarding adjacent properties eventually helps to build up a mini-fiefdom which exacts payment from hapless opponents to build up the player's treasury.\n\nBattles and events are also triggered when players land on certain squares, or when cards are thrown to ignite a fight. Capcom's monetary denomination is called Zenny, and it is present in games from Forgotten Worlds to Mega Man Legends. It also pays the rent in Gaia Master. At the end of the day, the player with the most Zenny wins.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2001-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"176951":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"3a8bda5f-8965-4bfd-a75a-9aec457aae2c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"859be6c0-4820-44ef-9ba5-5a1f4716826e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5c492d4d-cb4b-46f6-83ce-02edf15f3f07.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f831c3cc-6ae4-4d0b-8d2b-c75c736c0381.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 2: Torikago","Overview":"Grauen no Torikago Kapitel 2: Torikago (グラウエンの鳥籠 Kapitel 2 「鳥籠」) is the second chapter of Grauen no Torikago movie.

Players have about a month to spend with the sisters with each day broken up into three segments: first is the free time period before noon, followed by the period after lunch and ending with another period of time before bed. During day time, the player can choose which of the girls he wishes to escort to school, if any. The period after lunch is similar to the one in the morning, with additional choices which allow the player to go to various places in town besides walking home with one of the girls. Every night before bed, the player will be allowed to check his e-mail and send replies. As the player continues to interact with the sisters, their reactions to their big brother will change accordingly until the ending. According to one source, there are two different endings for each sister: the normal ending and the \"non-blood relation\" ending. As the name would suggest, the special ending reveals that the brother-character and sister aren't actually related by blood. In the case of some of the older sisters, this can lead to the protagonist and \"sister\" marrying one another. In Sister Princess 1, the player can see two different endings for each sister, but Sister Princess 2 has four endings for each sister. The first two were the non-sibling relation and siblings-together ending and, if the player chooses one sister in the beginning but ends up with another sister, either of the other two endings for the first sister who the player does not choose appear (\"non-blood relation\" ending and \"still brother and sister forever\" ending also) but with a different story. Sister Princess is one of the few popular dating game series that does not feature hentai elements. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, a rival company known as GIGA decided to create the hentai knockoff Colorful Kiss. While this game features a different cast of characters (to avoid lawsuits), their setup and personalities are comparable. Colorful Kiss was popular enough to warrant the sequel Colorful Heart. It is important to note that these GIGA titles are ultimately incestuous.","Publisher":"MediaWorks","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/segaretro.org\/Sister_Princess_Premium_Edition"},"177050":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sonic Team","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"54bca69f-50fd-4b46-903c-521af1f00651.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9677a886-ca6d-4b59-bb37-287d44525670.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1a408937-abcd-47e6-9fa0-6f30aea8f1f6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"943b38df-a17a-4b44-b548-526ad4c6ef0f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d3cd686d-930f-43be-91fd-7c80d64db47f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial","Overview":"Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial, not to be confused with Sonic Adventure 2: Trial Version, is a free demo of Sonic Adventure 2 for the Sega Dreamcast, which was bundled with releases of Phantasy Star Online.

One day, he finds a strange looking girl in his house and ends up living together, seeing how the house was too big for one person and all. It doesn't go too long before he finds himself living together with yet another girl, and yet another. All the girls are not entirely human and display animal traits such as dog's ears, cat's tails, and the likes. Thus his life on his own soon turns out more lively than he expected after leaving his parents.

However, something goes wrong, and seven people - two boys and five girls - become trapped in the park. The danger increases as they face a mysterious virus that brings them on the verge of death.\n\nThe player controls two different characters: Takeshi Kuranari, a simple, normal Japanese teenager, and a mysterious boy with amnesia, who cannot even remember his name. The relationship between the characters becomes more and more tense as the story develops. Will the young people be able to solve the mystery and escape death?\n\nEver17 is the second game in KID's Infinity series. The game is not connected to Never7: The End of Infinity either by storyline or protagonists, but both games share the same \"dreamy\", semi-futuristic setting, and their stories have a similar style. The gameplay of Ever17 is that of a visual novel: the player reads dialogues and watches scenes, viewing them as one of the two protagonists, occasionally having to make decision as to what to do next and how to answer in a conversation. Those decisions influence the course of the story and lead to different endings.","Publisher":"KID","ReleaseDate":"2003-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"181880":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Takuyo","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"bacf61dd-956f-4b9e-8827-27e1cb44d0fd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c6200aaa-e45d-47e1-85b4-834629d389de.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a4622b3e-dad4-4240-b885-551b619e0440.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"953fb53c-498f-47bb-b5bb-b79a41a16a95.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4e37dfc1-afaf-4f23-95b5-06eb30dd9dfd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kaitou Apricot","Overview":"Kaitou Apricot is a visual novel for the Sega Dreamcast.","Publisher":"Takuyo","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"181881":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Milksoft","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"070611d7-acfe-40f8-a136-17383104bf83.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ebc317dc-fb47-4602-8f72-14e5456bb146.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a5851153-4178-44d8-916c-8c2b1cbb790a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"02fc1b06-cdf5-4d77-9562-ea7299e91e59.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1ce0f3f9-a448-44e4-ae48-f65cd6177a53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kaze no Uta","Overview":"Kaze no Uta (aka Song of the Wind) is a visual novel erotic adventure game with explicit content.

The soldier soon falls in with Sue, a stranger to the Mimigas, but the only one who seems to know about the Dragon Eggs. Unfortunately the doctor wants her next.\n\nThe game closely resembles a NES platformer with a distinct 8-bit style and fast gameplay. The main character collects weapons (blade, bubbler, fireball, machine gun, nemesis, (super) missile launcher, polar star, snake, and spur) that can be leveled up three times. There are also health capsules to increase his life bar. There is a variety of jumping puzzles and boss battles to challenge players as they explore the game.\n\nThe DSiWare version of the game is fairly close to the original and does not contain most of the changes introduced in the earlier WiiWare release. It however contains the Sanctuary Time Attack mode, seasonal costumes for Christmas and Halloween, and a jukebox where all tracks of the game's soundtrack can be gradually unlocked.","Publisher":"Studio Pixel","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2013},"191333":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"BonusJZ","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a3e5b81a-a13c-4f72-b73b-37d9889e4ab8.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92ac5e7e-4aa6-4ade-839e-9f5291b34ae6.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9970218e-4fd9-405a-b461-c8701d7bab3c.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ghosts'n Demons","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2015},"191336":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Polykos Super Jelly Bean Quest in the Sketchbook of Illusion","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HotPengu","Images":[{"FileName":"8b05bdab-5aed-4525-b5fd-d8287211b957.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4169205a-2e65-4f62-bb02-49c92b5d6fde.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e63b7f16-012b-476b-9971-bfa2871937db.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d6e8925f-56a2-4bd9-b766-cc5347142ca7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cf7657c9-adcc-472c-844e-0263f85994fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3520de1f-9423-4c0b-aa63-8e5e0a94b5ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3a72fc32-5609-4c58-8370-e30b19d14227.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Polyko's Super Jelly Bean Quest in the Sketchbook of Illusion","Overview":"This is a free game, originally developed by HotPengu and brought to the Dreamcast by Senile Team.

The game is related to the Japanese horror film of the same name. \n\nWhat many call the grandfather of modern horror survival games, sweet home is a fine example of how details can make a simple game perfect. With a simple combat system, the game leads you to manage multiple teams and limited supplies of items in order to survive and espace the mansion. \n\nAnd beware, death is taken very seriously here! You die, you die, no going around it. \n\nSo...do you have what it takes to discover the horrible secrets behind the paranormal activity and escape the mansion?","Publisher":"divagante","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-18T00:00:00-07:00"},"201108":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"c704dcb9-527b-49d1-9c91-d577ec024a67.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3acb107c-d79d-460a-93bb-eaf1088ba234.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"314cdf4b-5bb7-4b0c-bf70-f84264739cff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes: Special Edition","Overview":"This is the Special Edition of Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes otherwise known as the Bandai Best version which contains both the original release and the Premium Edition on one disc.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2001-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gundam_Side_Story_0079:_Rise_from_the_Ashes"},"201295":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e5d99527-950b-41d2-a4b2-593621538b7b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"99b6b255-e8ba-4919-8a54-e3a236101936.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0d9035b2-f520-4d76-93cd-6825264c6044.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Castlevania: Resurrection","Overview":"Castlevania: Resurrection, canceled in March 2000, was intended to be the seventeenth title of the Castlevania series for the short lived Sega Dreamcast console. This would also be the third Castlevania game, at the time, to enter the 3D realm.\n\nThe game was to focus on Sonia Belmont and a new character, Victor Belmont, an 1800s vampire hunter who had abandoned his lineage. The story is set in 1666, directly before Simon Belmont's adventure in the original Castlevania.\n\nGreg Orduyan, the art director for the game, is so far the only staff member on the project to speak of how it would have worked out. Its cancelation is credited to many things, including disagreements between the Japanese and American Konami teams, and the death of the Dreamcast to the announcement of the Sony PlayStation 2.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":2020,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ALUQMR3N0B4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/castlevania.fandom.com\/wiki\/Castlevania:_Resurrection"}}
