The player advances from planet to planet by hitting specially marked targets, earning special bonuses throughout the game.\n\nPin•Bot's main feature is a grid of lights in the center of the playfield, just below the Pin•Bot. The player can fill this grid by hitting the targets above and to the right of it. Once completed, the visor opens, enabling the player to lock two balls in the robot's eye sockets, starting a two-ball multiball mode. The player can then re-lock one of the balls and use the other to score a Solar Value (jackpot) up the left ramp, at which point both balls go back into play and the visor closes. The player can reopen the visor by completing the grid again. Each shot up the left ramp increases the Solar Value until it is collected, and this jackpot is carried over between games.\n\nThe game's playfield also features a spiral ramp, which serves as a skill shot from the plunger, and a bagatelle-style mini-playfield at the Solar Ramp exit, which can feed the ball to the right inlane, the plunger, the pop bumpers, or directly back onto the playfield.","Publisher":"Williams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e6BUCPV7EQU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pin-Bot"},"39513":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maquinas Automaticas Computerizadas, S.A.","DOS":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"697c68d6-d0af-4f9a-8ab7-1ecb97b1f266.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"64749823-d0ba-49e6-81d5-b588cc732710.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Space Train","Publisher":"Maquinas Automaticas Computerizadas, S.A.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"40585":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bally Midway","DOS":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"06fb8b79-a32d-411c-a344-b39936cf9a96.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"9e6aa3a7-10af-498d-89d1-54915006c480.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a3384573-9a48-4327-b371-ec7ce4140739.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Who Dunnit","Overview":"The aim of the game is to solve five murder mysteries by interrogating suspects and finding evidence before heading to the Roof in the game to catch the killer.

The playfield deliberately hearkens back to the design philosophies of the electro-mechanical pinball machines of the '70s, with a single-level playfield and total ball visibility at all times. The object of the game is to complete 3 games of pool - Eight Ball, Nine Ball and Rotation - in order to start Cutthroat Countdown, a high-stakes pool game where each ball is called out in order; each ball you sink is worth 1M points times one plus the number of times Cutthroat Countdown has been successfully completed (maximum 3M) and the mode ends with a shot at a Super Jackpot worth twice the value of the balls you sank before either running out of time or sinking all the balls. Balls can be sunk in several ways; you can hit their affiliated target on the playfield, shoot an orbit with a lit Super Cue, shoot the center pockets or make the undocumented skill shot (soft plunge the ball to the upper flipper, then shoot the Bank Shot lane to score 100K and sink a ball).\n\nThe main gimmick, or \"toy\", of the game is the center pockets area, a set of three saucers behind a retractable post. When a ball is shot into the center pockets area, the post rises and the ball falls against it, thus making it into a captive ball; if a ball was previously locked, then it will be released from the center pockets and join the second ball on the post. You must then hit the post, which will hopefully transfer enough force to the ball(s) to send them into the center pockets, thus locking one or both of them.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1996-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rcrmrCpmynM"},"127490":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"e2a877fc-1880-4aae-b855-e7d504f02b0c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"7ab93f2b-c3c5-4e39-908e-9d17877a3922.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"8090912c-15c6-49cd-96cc-352420bee12b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b82198b-ef2a-4261-806f-2625fb1d4865.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Al's Garage Band Goes On a World Tour","Publisher":"Alvin G. and Company","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"128100":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bill Pfutzenreuter","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"1b285611-8d40-45d8-8298-bb3804f6837b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"deef58ac-8bee-4e2d-a592-c6023f60bf5a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"82b633a1-420d-4d1c-8b20-6e1ff60c657c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Doctor Who","Overview":"Doctor Who is a 1992 pinball game by Bally, based on the classic BBC television show.

Shoot the two Cyberdyne ramps to raise the Security Levels, repeatedly hit the Chase Loop for progressive bonuses, then fire the ball over the left loop and Escape into the saucer to collect more rewards. Hit the dropdown target below the T-800's skull, then load the swinging cannon and shoot the HK-Aerial across the playfield to start multiball.

The difficulty level is about the same; even though it is much easier to progress through the modes and reach the final mode, the playfield is more difficult. The game is based on the Arabian Nights, of course, with a Lamp, a Genie, and a flying carpet ramp. It has a beautiful and detailed backglass, which reminds me of a Magic card - can you guess which expansion it would be from? :-)\n\nSurprisingly, it is a very low scoring game. Williams seems to have done what Mexico did a few year ago, and chop three zeroes off their \"currency\". Scores are about one thousand times less than Attack from Mars. Replay is usually around 10-20 million, high scores around 40 million or so, anything over 100 million is a world-class score. Highest score I've ever seen is over one billion! The font for the high scores is the same as AFM, there's a lot of empty space where the billions would have been. The game rolls over at one billion, good luck getting there...\n\nAnother unique thing about Tales from the Arabian Nights (TOTAN) is that it goes out of its way to tell players free games are available. Instead of \"Replay at...\" it flashes \"Free game at...\" at the start of the last ball. During Match, it tells the players that a free game is possible if they match. This is a good feature for people new to pinball, who might not know about the Match feature.\n\nI would like to thank the people who helped me with this.

The interactive backbox contains a player controlled spinning spider. It is used to collect unique features and start special modes. Scared Stiff uses the DCS Sound System.\n\nScared Stiff was exhibited at the 1996 AMOA show in Dallas, with Cassandra Peterson present in her Elvira identity to promote the game.\n\nWhen Scared Stiff was introduced in 1996, it was designed to have moving rubber boogieman figures mounted over the slingshots. These were designed to move forward with the kicker each time the ball hit the slingshot. The game's ROM also allowed for the boogiemen to 'dance' to the music during the Boogie Man Boogie mode by kicking with the music. Very late in production, this feature was removed because the figures' arms were thought to eventually break off. An opening between the feet of the slingshot plastics is still present on all production machines, as well as an entry in the game's manual about the feature. Additionally, the code in the machine's ROM supports the feature. Because of this, many hobbyists have added the boogiemen figure modifications to their machines.","Publisher":"Williams Electronic Games, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/eonXllmKwKg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scared_Stiff_(pinball)"},"169318":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ed5baf56-d623-455d-bfae-5a58f19cfdeb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"d591a116-bb5b-434b-922a-b36470069498.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"05aea0f5-8c85-4756-bb48-9ae7b48704d5.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"dcdb199b-59e9-4b97-893d-112c89af3c34.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee14cbb2-b862-490f-9b39-3cc305751c56.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Supersonic","Overview":"The playfield is identical in design to Bally's 1976 'Star Ship'.\n\nThe first Concorde, the 001, flew its maiden flight on March 2, 1969 over France.

This was one of Bally's most successful tables, with nearly 17,000 machines manufactured.\n\nIt was initially released with artwork based on the original Star Trek television series. However, soon after production began, the decision was made to tie the game to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which was being released later in the year. This was done by updating the backglass art to show the Enterprise crew in one-color spacesuits, to be a closer match to their Motion Picture uniforms. Furthermore, an unnamed woman appearing on two playfield plastics was redrawn as Ilia instead.\n\nAlthough the pinball itself plays well, purist Trek fans will bemoan the slapdash use of the license, as only the artwork ties the game to the series. The Enterprise is shown firing a gigantic energy beam from its front saucer, one lane is labeled \"Jump to Hyperspace\", and the only Spelling Bonus on the entire table is for B-A-L-L-Y. Spock is the only regular character depicted on the playfield, accompanied by a smiling, generic blonde woman in a red jumpsuit (and Ilia in the redecorated version).

The game revolves around a bank heist, where you must avoid guards and sneak into the vault to crack the safe and get rich.\n\nIt is very different from most pinball machines — the playfield is noticeably smaller, allowing it to fit in places a conventional pinball machine couldn't go, and the backglass is rather large. Players do not have a finite amount of balls, but instead have a set time limit to get into the Vault, whereupon a board game begins on the backglass. The player (and the computer, playing the security guards) rolls the dice in hopes of getting a good space. Making it to the safe in the center ends the game, and the player is rewarded with a Magic Token that rolls out of the backglass.\n\nPlayers could keep playing to collect the twenty different token designs available. Alternately, players could use the tokens to play \"Assault on the Vault\", where they have 90 seconds and four balls to hit as many targets and shots as possible in order to break into the vault once again. A third use — intended in the design but never actually promoted — was for adult-oriented venues to let players redeem tokens for free drinks or other rewards.","Publisher":"Bally Midway","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/w3naS6OTZYY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Safe_Cracker_(pinball)"},"178127":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Stern Pinball, Inc.","Images":[{"FileName":"11b4b9be-09ab-4085-8fa9-dc507bef1924.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"7aad0a71-bfca-4d03-94c3-1ac447a04c67.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a0b279e7-e866-4cd7-bc48-3d88aea5431c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cd64ffa0-ae53-47cb-87f1-16ca620af823.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Shrek","Publisher":"Stern Pinball, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2008},"178128":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams Electronic Games, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"39ae63c9-d6d9-4833-9036-f191c7eaf3b9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"5c54b61f-1d23-4bfc-9780-d947a635833d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"98c3cb2f-ed9c-4161-baeb-33159d95dd93.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4b471f32-6383-4b52-9237-e45a58a35357.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Space Station","Overview":"Space Station is a Physical Pinball Table released by Williams Electronics in 1987.

Doing well at pinball rewards the player with power pellets, higher-scoring fruit, faster movement through the warp tunnel, and extra lives. The gameplay would return to the screen if the player shot the ball into a saucer or drained it, but draining would close the vertical chutes to lock Baby Pac-Man out of the pinball table.

Ben Heck. Heck, already (in)famous for building his own Bill Paxton pinball table, became inspired to develop a game combining Emery's love of pinball and all things paranormal. Emery, in turn, was inspired to start his own company to manufacture and sell it to collectors of boutique pinballs.\n\nThe game itself is about the wacky antics of four amateur Reality Show ghost hunters as they search for evidence of ghosts in various haunted venues. Visit places like the Abandoned Hospital, the Historic Theater, and the Haunted Bar, take photos of sneaky spectres, consult the Spirit Guide, then Complete Investigations for a chance to battle the six different Ghost Bosses. While the Ghost Minion on the playfield follows your ball, jump across the Theater Balcony, push open the Morgue Door, manipulate the haunted Hellivator to summon the Hotel Ghost, then use the high-tech and psychic powers of your team to clear each haunt. Color-changing LEDs and over a thousand comical quips keep things lively, but only the best will be able to Battle the Demon behind all the haunted happenings.","Publisher":"Spooky Pinball","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/GKNRZ2JYnvc"},"183988":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ea3d77d0-4871-4957-b1dd-aa6f31357e1f.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Apache","ReleaseYear":1978},"183989":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"9dcc00a4-6d2e-48f2-9773-90c6efbbcc95.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Bad Santa"},"185576":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data East Pinball, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"5b657ea5-e888-4b5b-8a7e-c1638248fe72.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5aa476ad-3e4a-49d3-9213-656094947e07.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Michael Jordan","Overview":"One \"blue cabinet\" version was made of this game, having a different backglass.

The table itself is more interesting, with a translucent red spiral and a miniature playfield nestled among neon flamingos, palm trees, and pastel-colored eighties pop art. A set of chutes sends the ball in various unorthodox directions, while the \"Hot Shots\" jump ramp allows players to quickly return to the upper mini-playfield.\n\nAs with other Premier pinballs of the period, the rules are not overly complex, making it suited for intermediate players looking for a fun, straightforward game. It's considered an overlooked jewel by those who managed to get past the silly theme, and is regarded as one of Premier's better games.

Located directly above the roulette wheel, a four digit display keeps track of virtual chips.

To flesh things out, Bally distributed an eight-page Comic Book\/Advertisement to arcade operators that provided a backstory: the invaders were a race of Giger-esque aliens who have infiltrated Earth as sprites in the Video Game cabinets. Now the second phase of their plan has begun, as the aliens exit the arcade games and combine to form incredibly addictive pinball machines that completely steal the minds (and quarters) of unsuspecting humans.\n\nThe art for the game (by Paul Faris) was heavily \"borrowed\" from the designs used in the movie Alien. Naturally, 20th Century Fox sued Bally over the resemblance, stopping production after 11,000 machines were manufactured.

Big Juicy Melons in 2014.\n\nThe object of the game is to win six casino games: 21 (Blackjack), Craps, Hi-Lo, Poker, Roulette and Slots. The last of these will be the most frequently played of the six games, as playing the slots lights the lock for Slot Machine Multiball, while the bumpers can be reached by shooting an unlit orbit, catching the ball in a magnet at the top of the orbits, which releases the ball on top of the bumpers. The games also award you chips if you win, which increase your bonus and also factor into one of the game's Wizard Modes. If this all seems a bit overwhelming, bear in mind that repeated ramp shots will grant you a Cheat Game, turning your next loss into a big win.\n\nThe other main feature of the table is Roll 'N Win, a simple backbox-mounted circular board game that you play by shooting the ramp when Roll 'N Win is lit. The game rolls two dice and you pick one, moving that many spaces, then taking whatever effect is on the space you landed on, which include instant multiball, spotting a casino game, big points, free chips and a mystery award. Each time you complete one circuit of Roll 'N Win, you activate a Super Award, starting with Super Pops, followed by Super Loops, then Super Spinner and finally Super Surprise. Landing on the starting space increases the Super Mode's duration by 50%, so try to do so whenever possible.","Publisher":"Stern Electronics, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2001,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/gKCLpOvNYXI"},"194398":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3a5f3e36-3700-4f99-9c5d-94f377df8eab.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"336af086-2121-4675-b7f8-c3eaf3172121.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d4890780-1b77-4a58-8558-9a5adccb3ef9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5d9de689-5a94-4b9f-b48b-213609a4e412.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9bbcc485-02eb-48f7-a22c-c3b68d6b033f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Hoops","Overview":"Hoops is a basketball themed solid state pinball machine released by Gottlieb under the Premier label in 1991.

Some find it a fun game with lots of scoring options and a challenging hunt for the Special bonus, while others find it too slow and easy for expert players.

The player could return to the pinball game if he exited the maze, but getting eaten by a T. rex would drain the ball.","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cbycxO8ugxE?t=24"},"194782":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3dbbe786-000e-45c7-8300-6fd3acc9b4ee.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e302608c-069c-44e5-85e6-1edd136b6aa1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cf131f03-3093-459a-96d7-d77009f4fa26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Road Runner","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1979,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/g74LKgHuebc"},"194797":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"db1ef76a-f214-42fd-a965-283bd2f1dfd7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"34199c63-a946-4b11-9239-0e996483ade2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"fc219736-c159-460f-8dd1-77b5f199a7e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"80400a54-dc0b-4ae0-bba2-f97956283b61.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Alien Poker","Publisher":"Williams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rrkmpLQ7cuA"},"194798":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"14dd97c1-3131-4da0-ae5d-4badeb80a1be.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"fe52c7f3-3b17-4872-a250-5e7f6813ff64.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"70cd1996-3755-4a43-914c-5db8121cd28a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0bd7e92f-1f60-431d-8f54-6214161fe29a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"79a14ac0-de40-4ae1-9c0b-8954e3e7e0c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Atlantis (Bally)","Publisher":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7d9irkFhUsE"},"194799":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3b580384-9344-47a6-bc60-04178b2240db.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"dc3cd99b-5e27-4cbc-a16b-57fb392e39af.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b94989b4-1b78-486e-b15c-658963659509.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Atlantis (Gottlieb)","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1975,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aOKzH1jTUBw"},"194800":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams Electronics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5c50c918-3d64-46c1-8e4e-2a29b868ddff.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"370eb728-9cae-45ec-aad5-5519efb6b68d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"228629df-42d7-40db-b95f-6792ad35a4d2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f30ccf58-decb-4fe6-8918-75fe7b6da6a1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Defender","Overview":"Defender is a Pinball Table designed by Barry Oursler and Joe Kaminkow, and illustrated by Constantino and Jeanine Mitchell.

In each wave, the player must protect ten Humanoids from being abducted by Landers and turned into Mutants; take too long to destroy the Landers, and Baiters will pop up from the playfield to thwart your shots. Hit the Pods to access the Warp target, then shoot down the Swarmers to open the Stargate. Skillful players will judiciously use Smart Bombs to destroy all enemies, while a well-timed press of the Reverse button will save wayward balls from draining down the left outlane.","Publisher":"Williams Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7UzvFnKPHac"},"194803":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a41ba6ac-a154-4028-885e-97dbc9b5cb96.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"8d9befac-6471-49c1-88e2-74778e2ebf75.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"6b4651f0-c8be-49a7-a3f2-2c9fff1ba9e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bdb48bcd-9538-48f7-8803-47553c74c398.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Circus","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980},"194804":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6fb0fa1e-daf0-453e-b3e1-6ead0eae67c2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"56e3864d-aa6c-4932-9f98-98be969af962.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"09eb9c65-9383-455f-83ce-ed56dbfdd816.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d7927383-9d52-422b-b377-afbf35135cd5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Diamond Lady","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"194805":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7fc1a156-fb96-430c-bb7c-2623966bdb08.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"3536f697-9b67-4142-94de-414091d8e540.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"b656f631-ecaa-428f-87eb-021789009446.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b0538574-8cfd-4fbf-911f-3bb11f5efb2d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Eight Ball Champ","Publisher":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"194806":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Premier Technology","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"512af261-9e0e-4b33-9792-c16895bd6a20.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"f22460ba-17b7-4bae-927d-a7bd8afa28e9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9a897cd0-4a00-485d-a9d3-3bdfbb0daa87.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"35903bb1-c5b4-4a89-a036-137c23da4b9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Monte Carlo (Gottlieb)","Overview":"A game that does have a gambling theme (in fact it's even located in one of Europe's finest casino sites) is Gottlieb's 1987 \"Monte Carlo\".

It was the last table made by Stern before their pinball division declared bankruptcy and closed its doors.\n\nThe game was originally conceived by Dixie Rinehart and Al Gross of Aspen, Colorado; their company, New Product Development People (NPDP), had invented various devices for NASA, such as zero-gravity toilets and agile astronaut gloves. After seeing a museum exhibit on gravity that featured marbles rolling around a bowled surface, they realized it could be turned into a game. When a pitch to Disney failed to yield fruit, NPDP contacted Stern Electronics, who agreed to develop it as the world's first \"3-D pinball\".\n\nInstead of a regular pinball's flat surface, the Orbitor 1 playfield consists of two parts: the bottom was molded plastic that was painted to resemble a lunar surface, while above it was a transparent warped plexi-bowl layer where the ball moves. Two spinning bumpers sat in the middle and a set of dropdown targets sat on the sides; in a moderately-lit room, the upper playfield was almost complete invisible, resulting in games that had pinballs swooping around the bumpers over a moon. The curved table even extended behind the flippers, and skilled players could make potential drains spin back onto the playfield. Even the backbox got into the act, with a molded planet and moon protruding from the art.","Publisher":"Stern Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"194892":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fa8574ab-06f8-4147-ac1b-6f209e21f4c4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"7d6e20c9-92b9-42e3-aaaa-501246e4608f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"327ea99c-36be-4f61-8dad-063570887400.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"63654ab6-3026-4523-9b2e-3d81bee63b08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fe8b02f6-261c-41bc-bcd8-e0324f1ee671.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Paragon","Overview":"Paragon is a Physical Pinball Table released by Bally in 1979.

Furthermore, distributors wanted a low-cost game for family centers where the play time could be easily managed. Oursler and his team completed Time Fantasy in two weeks, a time-based game designed around low-budget components and leftover pieces from other titles.\n\nTime Fantasy is reknown for its psychedelic fantasy theme, which has an anthropromorphic snail-like creature meditating contemplatively among a field of mushrooms in a surreal rainbow-colored landscape. Along with hitting targets and bumpers for points, the player can activate Time Ball for a temporary period of invincibility, then make specific shots to further extend that.

The game is as straightforward as the name — Token Human Annie is playing poker against her alien companions, and she needs your help to assemble a winning hand. Use the rollovers to select a suit, then hit the various drop targets to collect tens, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces. Collect extra balls along the way so Annie can keep taking her martian marks to the cleaners.","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/kaGZ7ot9RnM"},"195041":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Playmatic","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e1fb291f-adac-4e29-b70b-a9818c2ff66d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"41138775-86a5-4629-a436-4cb3f3c97541.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"b8a3ef3f-0bfd-482c-9383-beb3245d988f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"45211366-1238-448d-b5cc-6e706fc34da3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Big Town","Publisher":"Playmatic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1978},"195042":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Stern Electronics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"340d3e71-ae79-4aff-92c9-feb8428fbe67.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"6f58f61e-406d-4699-9138-54dcd5858ef6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d6102a69-31d7-4b30-8d3a-c3b6da68a6cd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"28da13dc-8aec-4e99-aa86-7e381e019246.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Big Game","Publisher":"Stern Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/FwjhHbzOEL0"},"195043":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chicago Coin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"df48590d-1296-4196-9a9b-07c95e1a29df.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"823397c1-5ac6-4d58-a6af-d0b50e02ca9e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Cinema","Publisher":"Chicago Coin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1976},"195044":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c86eb8b0-cce8-4ebf-95bc-39d7a2e68231.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Show Boat","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1961},"195143":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wico Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"529ff466-e6ce-46a1-baaa-f968da0760a3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"d736623c-1167-4044-bd57-5257d0adad5c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"da4024af-d5bb-4922-b782-5367f0c42545.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Af-Tor","Overview":"Notable Features: Flippers (2), Pop bumpers (4), Slingshots (2), Standup targets (14), 3-bank drop targets (2), Solitary drop targets (3), Spinning targets (2), Programmable gates (2), Kick-out hole (1), Rollunder (1), Left and right dual inlanes. Each pop bumper has a nearby target that lights it to increase its value for a limited time. Bonus multiplier advanced by completing four top rollovers with help from lane change capability. Hitting \"oil pit release\" target or the \"water hole\" target also spots a top rollover. Each outlane has a drop target blocking the ball from draining when earned by the player. The unusual shooter lane curve will aim a ball strongly shot into play directly towards the left outlane and its drop target. An operator option allows this drop target to be in the up position at the start of every ball. Two-ball multi-ball with double playfield scoring. Alpha-numeric displays. Hinged backbox. The backbox has two portions: a rear portion made of metal which houses the control board and the driver board, and a front portion made of wood and screwed to the metal portion and which houses the fluorescent light box, backglass, and alphanumeric display assembly. The lower cabinet front, back, and bottom are metal while its sides are wood. Two sturdy metal columns elevate the backbox allowing the playfield to extend under it. In the backbox, fuses F1 to F6 each have a lit green LED indicating the fuse is good. Fuses F7 and F8 do not have this LED.\n\nThe upper playfield has left and right return lanes each allowing the player to shoot the ball through a spinning target and back to the top of the playfield. At the top of these return lanes are wireform gates controlled by the CPU. The player can hit targets and rollovers to open one or both of these gates. If the left gate is open, the player can complete a ball orbit through both spinners by shooting through the right-side return lane. Similarly, if the right gate is open, the player can complete a ball orbit through both spinners by shooting through the left-side return lane. Completing an orbit with green light flashing will light 'Barren X Zone' insert in center playfield for immediate doubling of playfield scoring until the green light goes out.\n\nSound: electronic, no knocker.\n\nFactory-installed illumination:\nBackbox - one fluorescent tube.\nPlayfield - all lamps are incandescent.\nCabinet - front has all incandescent lamps.","Publisher":"Wico Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BM_FUxZwn8A"},"195350":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4fba8f1f-82b0-4cb1-a59d-1f47c2596b35.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"f14bb6db-3ed6-48d8-b1bc-0c0a210fc70b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3648f5ce-4e2c-4870-b43f-82ba63d18e78.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee8f232c-caa9-42be-b714-7f27adaa7387.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Solar Fire","Publisher":"Williams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981},"195351":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Playmatic","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"82b882cd-fe41-42b7-b51c-0a73edb42034.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"7d827a92-ced3-42ec-a645-50ec08b6e001.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"2598a112-dcc1-407a-9e85-1b1a0c33da9a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cbc354c2-dace-4eea-b774-e4996b376754.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Space Gambler","Publisher":"Playmatic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1978},"195375":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Premier Technology","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7f475c1d-d001-4edd-bff4-48baee8e6f0b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"34cfa327-5dba-4ea4-8719-b31a3e7326db.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f49053cf-d5d5-4b5e-8f8d-c02bd81c7fe9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bac12330-f235-4c07-8187-3d0ca772f332.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Shaq Attaq","Overview":"This 1995 basketball themed pinball from Gottlieb is “A real slam dunk!”\n\nAn actual moving basket located under the dome challenges players to sink baskets, timing is essential as the ball sails airborne.","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/dtjCiAfCaYs?t=26"},"195376":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1fd40b29-298c-4a0e-8bc2-51461168a48c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"336cf006-69fe-4b37-bd6d-ac7ba0cc78cd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"6da3e46d-3c31-4476-a354-75722666f660.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fe1b7484-e280-4f52-8e98-451239008ad8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Volcano","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ase3QCIZa-4"},"195377":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b70150c3-0452-415d-844d-cb11dd8165c1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"7ef112de-2ed4-461c-89ac-3de3a82eab85.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"dc8f49e3-5dfc-4dc1-9a6e-7efea641dc36.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3fbb6026-68ba-435b-a351-a373ea06eef0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9b294d78-01ae-49e4-a6b6-f306766e9e0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Totem","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1979,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/E3EAtbyKtIM"},"195378":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"78388ae3-8fb0-40d5-b5cb-4cf0bdc1aa54.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"6440a95a-d34d-44a4-bffc-a3237376c76f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d1d1cc8e-3fd2-41de-a0dd-5d17c4bb2a62.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9f279d34-0a89-4c31-b509-70ff30507c35.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Time Warp","Overview":"Time Warp is a 4 player pinball machine from September 1979 produced by Williams.\n\nIt is notable for being only one of two pinball machines (Williams' 1978 Disco Fever being the other) to ever use curved \"banana flipper bats, which made the ball easier to trap.\n\nThe table features a variety of mythological and historical themes.

Each of the playfields has two flippers. The top or upper playfield (1) is accessed by the ball shooter and four metal ramps from the main level. The main or second level playfield (2) is completely covered with a thick piece of plexiglass which forms the window to view the lower playfield. The lower or mini playfield (3) can be accessed after a ball drain if enough Elektra units have been collected. Elektra contains four balls. Two are used on the main and upper playfields. They alternate during normal play, both are activated during multiball. A third ball is kept captive at the top of the upper playfield to knock down in-line bonus multiplier targets. The fourth ball is dedicated to the lower playfield.\n\nThere are two main objectives when playing Elektra (besides racking up bonus points and multipliers). One, achieve multiball and two, gain Elektra Units for time in the lower playfield. Mulitball is challenging and usually does not last long. The lower playfield becomes active after the ball(s) drain and there is enough Elektra Units earned. Elektra Units earned are shown in a separate 2-digit display in the bottom center of the backglass.","Publisher":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/pJC7_KlHjnk"},"195403":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d64695ed-45db-4b2e-abb9-f5ed01bf5604.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"71b58d00-0914-4535-9d85-95b6364d2da8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a68ca99e-eb00-49c6-869c-ce6d94bb56d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5b9ae68f-5761-4fad-9a12-0d7f531ee8f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Big Shot","Overview":"The goal of the game is to light all 15 billiard ball lights. The player must hit the ball drop targets on either side of a central bumper to light its corresponding ball light, except the 8 ball. The 8 ball is lit by either going through the middle gate or by stopping in the center pit. When stopped in the center pit, a diverter (also called a gate) will change position, allowing a ball drained in the right outlane to return to the plunger lane. Once all the ball lights are lit, the special can be achieved by hitting the target on the special lit side. The light switches sides when the slingshots are hit. Replays can be achieved by hitting the special lit side and by earning 50,000 points, 64,000 points, and 72,000 points.","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1974,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nU2a33mopjI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_Shot_(pinball)"},"195404":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Frank Thomas' Big Hurt"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Premier Technology","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3fe5a467-4620-44cb-848a-aa400d9682cb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"a1432545-e67e-45de-af03-25e22730f20c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"50da92d3-ebe6-4fdb-8c99-a8a8f7356e13.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"58b89cba-55ef-41fa-a4e7-ced99c2b75ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Frank Thomas' Big Hurt: The Pinball Game","Overview":"Frank Thomas' Big Hurt is a pinball machine designed by Bill Parker and released by Gottlieb in 1995.

When each ball is plunged into play, the blocking gate between the flippers is activated and remains in place until each ball achieves 300k points. By rolling through the right or left lane twice, the big money shot is lighting the right and lift saucers for 500k. Once lit, the saucers remain lit until the end of the game.

Moloney named the company after his initial product, Ballyhoo, one of the first commercial pinball machines ever created. Ballyhoo bears little resemblance to the current crop of pinball machines, as it possesses no flippers or bumpers, and no single hole at the bottom of the playing field. Instead, players attempted to guide small metal balls through a maze of pins surrounding multiple holes, each worth between 100 and 500 points. Bally produced two versions of the game, one that dispensed five balls for a nickel, and one that provided seven balls for a single penny. The game sold well, no doubt in part to Moloney's catchy slogan: \"What they'll do through 32... Play Ballyhoo!\"","Publisher":"Bally","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1932,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/8ZA8IJClNzw"},"195994":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e8dc49e8-8f67-4260-9a3e-c09f8e28dcaa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer -

It was originally an independent project by the former before the latter picked up the design to put into wider production.\n\nThe game's focus is on the pinball action, which centers around starting, overheating, and destroying nuclear reactors (in that order). Shooting the scoop activates them, hitting the grid drop targets heats them up, and shooting the game's sole pop bumper will finally explosively overload it. Repeating this process will ultimately result in the titular total nuclear annihilation. This stripped-down approach results in a rather difficult but deceptively simple game that is well-suited for competitive play.","Publisher":"Spooky Pinball","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2017,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/EJac8bT7Y8M"},"196423":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Williams","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4bdc2deb-0699-4c0a-8a8c-7a1d45533300.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer -

Designed by Wayne Neyens and illustrated by Roy Parker, it is highly prized by connoisseurs as a true classic of the electro-mechanical era.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the success of Playboy magazine led Hugh Hefner to open Playboy Clubs nationwide. Dave Gottlieb tasked designer Wayne Neyens to create a game capitalizing on the trend without actually using the name or the license. Neyens and Parker responded with Slick Chick, a title that used pretty girls to mask a very challenging and clever table.\n\nThe center of the playfield consists of nine bumpers in a criss-cross pattern, spelling SLICK CHICK; hitting the letters in order lights them up, and completing the title lights one of the five rollover buttons. Get all five buttons, then shoot the center gobble hole for 100 points and a Special — but if the player shoots it too soon, he gets nothing except a drained ball. The target-packed playfield and the love\/hate relationship with the center hole combined to create a game that walked the fine line between fun and frustration, a simple but addictive game that required precise skills from players.","Publisher":"Gottlieb","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1963,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/AWiVOKA0eCk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slick_Chick_(pinball)"},"196435":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gottlieb","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"13b985d8-02c8-4cd3-98e6-3d54302374c4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer -

The game will immerse players in campy fun and heart-pounding action as the crime fighting Dynamic Duo comes to the aid of the Gotham City Police. Throughout the game, Batman and Robin work to deduce clues and discover super villain plots in an effort to thwart evil plans and capture bad guys. Players are guided through the game by the voices of none other than the original Batman and Robin, Adam West and Burt Ward.\n\nA Hall of Fame pinball development team created the all new Anniversary Edition machine. The project was inspired by Joe Kaminkow of Ka-Pow Pinball and spearheaded by Stern Pinball product development chief, George Gomez, who, along with renowned programmer, Lyman Sheats, brought the game to life.\n\nIn addition to the fun title and game experience, the machine features a full color high definition display replacing the dot matrix display.
