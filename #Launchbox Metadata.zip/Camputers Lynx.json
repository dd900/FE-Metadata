The maze is made up of three floors which can be moved between by lifts and each key must be found in order. Once you find key one you then have to take it back to your starting position which then places a bomb in the maze. The bomb needs to be defused in a period of time before it explodes or you lose one of three lives. Once the bomb has been defused then you must find key one again before you can find key two and this is the sequence the keys must be collected for all seven keys. As you search the maze, monsters start to appear and a monster keeps appearing after a period of time. If you are caught by a monster then a life is lost but you are armed with a limited amount of grenades to throw.

One difference from other Space Invaders variants is that each shot launches two projectiles and therefore it's possible to take out two aliens in one go. Once all the aliens have been destroyed the player moves on to the next wave where things get tougher. There are three different alien types (plus the mystery ship) and they are worth different points depending on how far off they are.

Two extra lives can be won by reaching certain points milestones. The first one is about when you get to 5,000. The hordes of invaders start off lower down with each level.
