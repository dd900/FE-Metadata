Like in all other games of its kind the player controls a laser base left and right down the bottom of the screen while blasting away at the aliens above. At the same time the player has to avoid getting hit by the aliens' projectiles by taking cover behind four barriers that offer some protection. One difference from other Space Invaders variants is that each shot launches two projectiles and therefore it's possible to take out two aliens in one go. Once all the aliens have been destroyed the player moves on to the next wave where things get tougher. There are three different alien types (plus the mystery ship) and they are worth different points depending on how far off they are. After all three lives of the player has been used up the game is over.\n\nYou are limited to two bullets on the screen at any one time, but can fire them separately if you tap the space bar quickly. Two extra lives can be won by reaching certain points milestones. The first one is about when you get to 5,000. The hordes of invaders start off lower down with each level. However, if you do really well then you get a new set of invaders (intended to be more fierce looking) and they start back up at the top again.","Publisher":"Camsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yK6zhON9Nlk"},"132205":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gem Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"80a0520c-69b9-470f-8c46-1bc75bd63df5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b593668d-4983-488d-b8c1-2cd3d5f2dd44.png","Type":"Cart - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Monster Mine","Overview":"Outwit the monsters of the mine which guard enough gold to make you rich forever.\nMonster Mine is a maze game viewed from above with the whole maze on the screen and you have to move about the maze collecting gold nuggets.
