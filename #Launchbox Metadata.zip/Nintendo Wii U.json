Kaos, previously defeated by the Skylanders, finds himself in a toy store on Earth. He finds a portal and goes back to an era where Arkeyans, an evil robot race, ruled the Skylands.\n\nLike the previous game, it uses figures which through an accessory called 'Portal' allow to play as the character in the game. The original figures are compatible with the game, but new series of stronger characters are introduced. One of the new characters are the eponymous Giants. These are larger than Skylanders, up to twice as big, and have different in-game abilities such as picking-up large objects and throw them to clear a pathway. The character can be changed at any time by switching the figure standing on the portal. The levels consist of platform maps containing puzzles, enemies, breakable objects that yield money and various treasures. Each level has different goals that must be met to achieve a three-star rating. Once the first level is cleared, the player gains access to a hub from which the levels can be replayed to master it and reach every goal. Some treasures will reward the player with equipment items that change the character's looks and improve their abilities.

The game was released for the Wii U on November 18, 2012 in North America and November 30, 2012 in Europe and Australasia. Microsoft Windows, iOS, OS X, Linux and Android versions followed throughout 2013. A Nintendo Switch version was released on March 16, 2017 in North America, and on March 23, 2017 in Europe and Australasia.\n\nLittle Inferno is set in front of a brick fireplace, which the player uses to set various objects, such as toys, dolls, and electronics, on fire. The game encourages the player to burn any combination of objects to see how they react when lit ablaze, as most of the objects have unique properties. Little Inferno is classified as a sandbox game as it offers few traditional objectives to complete and has no states of failure. The game was designed as a satire of similarly themed video games in which the player dedicates long amounts of time to performing tasks considered to be unrewarding.","Publisher":"Tomorrow Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16091":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WayForward","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"f7a508f1-a96c-4301-9658-da84c76c6976.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1742d47e-9831-45d3-b4c7-77d5b3ea1178.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb69eb78-e1c1-4e42-aea7-fc6611bbe45e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a0d7338a-7d31-4197-814d-ddc6f9288068.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"afae3d8e-0d49-4591-ba41-ebbe437fc075.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mighty Switch Force!

Karts, which feature similar designs from Mario Kart 7, can be customized once again, alongside the returning bikes, which handle similar to the karts now and can only perform a wheelie via a boost, and the newly introduced buggies, as well as, according to an interview, more customization options that have yet to be revealed. The hang-glider and underwater mechanics also return, as well as Coins, with the player being able to collect up to ten in one race as in Mario Kart 7. Like Mario Kart Wii, twelve racers are present in normal races.\n\nThe newest feature for the series is anti-gravitational segments, that not only allow for more dynamic track design, but also for racers to drive across walls and ceilings. When in anti-gravity, if a racer bumps into another racer, the kart spins rather than just bumping and both racers receive a speed boost. These tracks have been described as more narrow when compared to previous Mario Kart tracks, specifically those from Mario Kart Wii. For the fifth time in the series, courses from previous Mario Kart games will be included, and both the game's anti-gravity mechanic, as well as Mario Kart 7 's \"air, land, and sea\" mechanic will be incorporated into these retro courses, much like the retro courses in Mario Kart 7.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2014-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mU7tXqYplA8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mario_Kart_8"},"17641":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fun Labs","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"7517f0ad-a67d-4694-abc5-4a1bf7baf0fc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e4df93a9-3a58-4ecf-9a05-962da5ca3f9f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ca8b4c7b-8aac-4386-ab19-84f80e26946f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"596de437-694d-4519-a7ab-0e4bbb30f2ac.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fe0764ec-693e-441e-be2f-d195ce606d63.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"87278440-b321-4f37-a432-3e57f86c0076.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8194ad04-4b7e-4061-b4f3-d1e2aac340d7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5db8f257-1f93-475f-a944-3faa44e3866e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"69c02baa-f682-4c96-a1b3-f8b4d0feb140.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9ccf48bb-62cd-4b2e-9017-79689f423290.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"78a084b7-d802-4d7d-ba5f-83267e0a7926.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2a069c92-d5d8-418b-af3a-fc2c9cdbb007.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Angry Birds Trilogy","Overview":"Angry Birds Trilogy is a compilation of the first three games in the series:\n\n-  Angry Birds\n-  Angry Birds Rio\n-  Angry Birds Seasons\n\nExcept for the original Angry Birds on the PS3 as a PlayStation Mini, none of the games were previously available for the listed platforms.

With the exception of non-humanoid characters, such as those from the Cars series, each character has a double jump and a default set of attacks, as well as an ability unique to each figure. For example, Sulley can roar to scare others whilst Violet can turn invisible. There are two main modes in this game: Play Set[4] and Toy Box.[5] Each play set is essentially a self-contained world with its own gameplay, based on a specific movie or series with recognizable characters and storylines. Characters from one world cannot enter into another world, but players can put any character together in Toy Box mode. Toy Box is a sandbox mode that players can fully customize and explore.","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"17824":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"074fe7a9-2284-4e23-8dd9-341a5ca36b75.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d87bc210-28f6-44ad-8c79-b7647497a1eb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b034e569-4601-481b-ac5c-91d50f724af0.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f13fd311-ebc1-4370-b639-b37c654b1023.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1177666a-4e36-4ab2-8741-2403a9000ea7.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4adaf81a-8e78-4aad-a9b0-d63097cec297.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1a6f4108-09c8-41f9-83d9-9d8e789ceaa5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"58e17d25-81ec-4bb0-be03-efbf48b5d845.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"966a0ed4-d6e7-4aaa-8972-10f2170a6240.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8f98ab2d-83db-473f-b01b-d2cb2c3292c5.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b31278c9-b183-48fa-83d6-55447c1c34fe.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"22736a88-e18e-4153-bc56-3b7ea65ae9df.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c15e4b92-218b-4cbb-9fee-707da2edaea9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"50442ba3-4e71-46ee-8dd3-e01b0bde6fc7.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"37da60f9-22a5-4d90-b11d-b7617f9c58bc.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"03b4ecb1-3a20-423a-9e58-c5d2f62a5d89.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"35659fa0-6c0f-4578-bcde-a5da75fe5cac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"40c50eb3-d667-4321-8442-f74229111f23.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9dcbbbb2-481f-4706-b2e9-8754de3b3d65.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b12bc43b-aa29-40aa-b236-6c4981cf5acd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f16ae2f6-474f-4d2f-aeb4-c17edd27fee2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD","Overview":"The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea—a first for the series.

It is during a battle against the forces of evil who attacked during this ritual that sixteen Skylanders acquired a new power: they are now able to swap their top and lower halves with each other. These new Skylanders now have joined Flynn and the others in the task of protecting Cloudbreak Islands from Kaos, under the request from Woodburrow's villagers.\n\nThe game starts when a girl from Woodburrow lands on Flynn's ship to request the Skylander's help. The player must first protect the ship from waves of enemies (the ship crashes anyway), then reach Woodburrow, which will act as the game hub from this point onward. The levels are made of branching paths with some puzzles and enemies, in which the Skylander figure placed on the Portal of Power, who now have the ability to jump, explores and gain gold, experience and finds the many treasures needed to get all of each level's three stars. Some of the paths can only be accessed by Skylanders of a specific element, and the new Swap Skylanders can access paths for which two different elements are needed. The Swap Skylanders have specific abilities on both their top and bottom halves; the top has attack abilities while the bottom has movement and defensive abilities. The bottom also has a Swap Zone power, which is needed to access special challenges that will then be available to play again from Woodburrow. Each completed level can also be replayed to find more hidden treasures when new Skylanders are available. Each Skylander progresses by gaining experience and by upgrading their skills in special pods found in Woodburrow or in the levels themselves. The character progress data is then stored in the character figure.\n\nThe Starter Pack includes:\n\n    Skylanders: Swap Force game and Portal of Power\n    Wash Buckler\n    Blast Zone\n    Ninja Stealth Elf\n    Three character trading cards\n    Three character sticker sheets\n    A Skylanders: Swap Force collector's poster\n\nSome releases of the WiiU bundle had an exclusive green and gold color shift Wash Buckler.","Publisher":"Activision Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19776":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"477ae224-4f14-4990-8fac-63e3b4521f3e.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6a47b612-ff53-4885-b34f-5a56a5e46612.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5d35515c-dc27-4fc1-9c6c-e04f62a09c85.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d89f61a4-46ca-407d-a189-b1596fdf5ff5.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2814e714-a697-43e6-ac52-fb4457d1e56b.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0f12805e-8b77-47cc-8005-7c8b40d9e710.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6bbc385b-99a3-44a5-9aa0-2c66a5ced1a9.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5fac29e7-dec0-4232-ab05-806eb980fb1a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b742554e-74a0-46bd-bf2f-ff55a1c1de91.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9bad9028-9bc8-4801-b522-7965bb200617.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"27587646-7ad8-4af4-9906-56fd3ec7de97.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"New Super Mario Bros.

Similar to developer Good-Feel's previous title Kirby's Epic Yarn, the game is set in a world where the characters and environment are composed of yarn and cloth. Yoshi retains much of his moveset from the Yoshi's Island series of games, including using his tongue to swallow enemies and using his flutter jump to reach hard areas, and many elements such as flowers and mystery clouds return. However, unlike other games where swallowing enemies would produce eggs which Yoshi could then throw, Yoshi instead produces balls of yarn. These yarn balls have various uses when thrown, such as tying up enemies or filling in certain platforms and objects. Players can also gather white chicks, which produce temporary cloud platforms when thrown. The game also supports up to two players cooperatively, with players able to swallow and throw their partners, allowing them to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nThe game supports Nintendo's Amiibo figurines and Yoshi has the capability of using woolen transformations to progress through the game.

The sixth main installment in the franchise, it was officially announced at Ubisoft's E3 2014 press event on 9 June 2014 alongside Just Dance Now—a web-based spin-off of the franchise. It was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, and Wii U on 21 October 2014 in North America, 23 October in Europe, 24 October in the UK and 25 October in Asia.[1] A sequel, Just Dance 2016 was released in October 2015.\n\n2015 introduced additional social networking features to the series, including the ability for players to challenge other players online, and submit clips of themselves playing for inclusion into compilation videos featured in-game. The game also added the ability for a smartphone to be used as a controller with a companion app.\n\nJust Dance 2015 received mostly positive reviews by critics, praising the franchise's continued focus on a casual audience through its forgiving motion detection, multiplayer functionality, and pop-oriented soundtrack, although criticism was directed at the soundtrack for focusing too much on teen pop, as well as its user interface for having confusing and irregular conventions. As of December 31, 2014, over 5 million copies have been shipped worldwide.[2]","ReleaseDate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"24753":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalanche Software","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1fd13c29-ec20-4530-8665-c143be7ba73d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1e8bfb51-8213-4b62-812a-51113ff8c033.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"64496186-fb97-447f-90b6-7dbf54800278.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Disney Infinity 2.0 Edition","Overview":"In Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, players will use real-world interactive Marvel figures to activate original storylines (Play Sets) in the virtual game worlds of some of Marvels most popular franchises, including The Avengers.

The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple gameplay modes are available, including survival mode where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players play custom maps created by other players and a spectator mode. The PC version of the game is renowned for its third-party mods, which add various new items, characters, and quests to the game.\n\nThe alpha version was publicly released for PC on May 17, 2009, and after gradual updates, the full version was released on November 18, 2011. A version for Android was released a month earlier on October 7, and an iOS version was released on November 17, 2011. The game was released on the Xbox 360 as an Xbox Live Arcade game on May 9, 2012; on the PlayStation 3 on December 17, 2013; on the PlayStation 4 on September 4, 2014; on the Xbox One the next day; on the PlayStation Vita on October 14, 2014; and is scheduled for release on the Wii U on December 17, 2015. On December 10, 2014, a Windows Phone version was released. All versions of Minecraft receive periodic updates, with the console editions being co-developed by 4J Studios.\n\nMinecraft received five awards during the 2011 Game Developers Conference. Of the Game Developers Choice Awards, it won the Innovation Award, Best Downloadable Game Award, and Best Debut Game Award; from the Independent Games Festival, it won the Audience Award and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize. In 2012, Minecraft was awarded a Golden Joystick Award in the category Best Downloadable Game. As of June 2015, over 70 million copies had been sold, including 20 million between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and 20 million on PC, making it the best-selling PC game to date and the third best-selling video game of all time. On September 15, 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion; the acquisition was completed on November 6, 2014.","Publisher":"Mojang AB","ReleaseDate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minecraft#Console_editions"},"33799":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f765966e-9eff-429f-8a59-8a2047cd8f96.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1f29eaa3-f85e-435f-b943-2b6f63afa1f5.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b36a82dc-36fe-4646-84f3-f25b1ee75c35.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"be06d350-9625-4343-b39c-64b5480b1c8f.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"38051628-9e56-46f0-a508-1beb46408a54.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5b3cdf8-a113-443a-8e19-2d47d6d3b552.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"65b31952-208f-4efe-aceb-0c1f2a1adece.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b757714d-f313-480b-acbd-d0427c2ab118.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e0bae15a-edfd-4f90-962c-8c8c0a20365e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4efa9871-f2e6-4814-b605-2322091c8a62.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ba3c891d-6a63-466b-8b61-431d9ee2029b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"75d37b4b-451f-47cd-a1d2-8470aeba4fc1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c0ae2a81-97e8-493f-9be1-f41c90686f5a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ef58b8c7-10d2-4438-a681-3090f049e00b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bfd5e696-1197-4582-ada7-5db62c041c9f.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4a9a84f7-857a-4517-8933-7a7ac226a68f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c76cff30-a263-45d3-a9f7-817ce4b66e90.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d79cfa19-e5b7-4fdd-95a9-2342b2aef067.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD","Overview":"The grand adventure of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess comes to the Wii U in a remastered and enhanced version of the original Wii hit.

Zero: Black-Haired Shrine Maiden) in Japan and Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in PAL regions, is a survival horror video game developed by Koei Tecmo and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa.\n\nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fatal_Frame:_Maiden_of_Black_Water"},"34243":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalanche Software","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"dd402641-9ace-4f5d-96c1-3cdc557d9895.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e6a28b1-ba20-4cf7-b3da-0353924fc310.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ec33229f-c0a0-4ff6-83ef-c985c4ffa339.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6e6560e-6370-4646-a959-87376eec662f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition","Overview":"Disney Infinity 3.0 Edition now welcomes Star Wars™ to the ever-growing collection of Marvel, Disney and Disney•Pixar characters, stories and worlds.

The game was released exclusively for Nintendo eShop on Wii U as part of the Year of Luigi. As the title suggests, the game stars Luigi in a game very similar to Dr. Mario. Unlike his brother, Dr. Luigi still wears his hat rather than a head mirror, although later in Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure, Luigi wears the head mirror.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the original Dr. Mario game. Players must eliminate viruses by stacking Megavitamins on them by ultimately creating a row of four or more of the same color. In this game, however, there is a new game mode named Operation L, which involves stacking multicolored L-shaped pills in reference to Luigi.\n\nCombos are altered in this game. In Dr. Mario, when a player gains a combo, the opponent will receive two half-Megavitamins to stall progress. In Operation L, when a player gains a combo, the opposing player's upcoming Megavitamin will have its colors switched.\n\nLike Dr. Mario Online Rx, if the player completes the 20th level with the high speed in every mode (except multiplayer) the credits will roll.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2013-12-31T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CFfa_BuKJdI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dr._Luigi"},"90932":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PlatinumGames","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c37f7736-31af-4e3e-afc2-3cafd49f0614.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e3d80ecf-d5bc-4206-97e2-51f10275e9e5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7ae84752-d31f-4ad9-850b-361ae5ef1588.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c103f83f-371b-45a8-b8a6-cdf553a4c0d0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a68dade7-f37f-4680-a364-4912af41d506.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"b4fa254a-bedf-4131-98d6-fc20c4c7dd9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"659348fd-1717-4490-be38-5f55fd47e792.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7dd0772f-41c5-43dc-8db8-6ebed52d35f8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Fox Guard","Overview":"Star Fox Guard is a 3D tower defense game in which players must protect various bases, owned by Slippy Toad's uncle, Grippy, from oncoming attackers by monitoring security cameras.

To defend the base's core, players must watch the monitors carefully for any oncoming attackers and switch control to one of the available cameras in order to fire its weapon. Enemies are divided into two classes; Combat robots, which must all be defeated in order to progress, and Chaos robots, which hinder the player by tampering with the cameras, such as obscuring the view or showing fake footage.

Prophecies predicted it. Chosen ones chose to believe in it. Now the adventure saga continues. A sequel is coming. Join Wilbur, Ivo, Nate and Critter in another classic point-and-click adventure in the wicked world of Aventasia. Help them fulfill their destiny. A destiny as yet unwritten. A few years have passed since our heroes heroically defeated the arch-witch Mortroga. And their lives, like the lives of most people in Aventasia, are still in turmoil. The War of the Two Towers is over, but the wounds it left upon the land are still bleeding. The gnome Wilbur Weathervane is struggling with his new job as a teacher at the reopened School for Wizardry and Witchcraft. His magic wand is having a mind of its own and an assassination plot against the arch-mage overshadows the first democratic elections in Sea stone. Faced with political intrigues that threaten the delicate balance of peace, Wilbur is in dire need of his old friends. But the elf princess Ivo and the adventurer Nate have, after a brief romantic interlude, gone their separate ways. Ivo has returned to her gilded cage in the elf kingdom, overprotected by her controlling mother. Nate along with his trusty companion Critter has been taken prisoner on the flying island of his arch-enemy the Red Pirate. But fate does not rest. A darkness has fallen upon the land, or rather, a pinkness. A magic force is turning mighty beasts into fluffy plush puppies and towering castles into oversized dollhouses. Every world needs its heroes.

To do so, players must use a variety of systems via the touch-screen on the Wii U Gamepad, such as switching from a fuel engine to an electrical engine, changing the thrust level and changing the landing gears, among others. In each level, players will encounter a series of obstacles, some of them environmental, some other being enemies that players have to find a way to sneak around from by tweaking the ship's systems to go through undetected. Players can always look at the Small Craft's output meters on the Wii U Gamepad's screen to see how much heat, electricity and sound they are producing, as well as which of the ship's systems are causing it, in order to reduce them and go past the enemies. Some enemies will also react to the ship's presence and will have to be scared away by pointing the ship's flashlight at them.","Publisher":"KnapNok Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Affordable_Space_Adventures"},"116095":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Pokken Tournament","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai Namco Studios Inc","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"69d643cd-b856-41d2-8ffb-1f951bd797b0.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"daf942ae-bd37-451d-8b31-6d2c35830ec2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5fe31125-8275-4445-9de9-a8155420914d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d04b1df8-35d4-4752-812a-75b19cddd0e3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ad0c637e-4b4e-4a78-af50-a4e9640771c2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pokkén Tournament","Overview":"Pokkén Tournament is a fighting video game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and published by The Pokémon Company.

What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent’s grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent’s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you’ve won the game.

Fire is everywhere, not only making it time consuming to put it out, but potentially hurting Officer Wagon.

Wield the immense power of a living sword and slice through enemies in tactical battles to save your family from a grim fate. One night, you awaken in a strange place, dazed and confused. You come across a house that looks suspiciously like your own and decide to investigate. Inside, you glimpse a mirror – your reflection stares back at you, but something is horribly wrong. Your arm has been severed from your body, and visions of your family being dragged into a strange realm by unknown forces scream through your head. A grotesque creature appears behind you, grants you a sword and tells you that, though this house may seem like your home, it is not. You’ve been transported into a strange void along with your family, but they’re nowhere to be seen. Now, you must embark on a perilous journey to find them and return home. Navigate creative, maze-like dungeons – some of which are huge, living creatures – filled with unnerving beasts, treacherous traps and perplexing puzzles. Move around in a first-person perspective and closely survey your surroundings for clues as you journey into the unknown. Throughout your eerie adventure, you’ll be confronted by all sorts of terrifying and monstrous creatures. By swiping on the Wii U GamePad touch screen, you can swing your sword in different directions – slash away at the ghoulish monsters to inflict damage, or parry their attacks in defence. Use long swiping motions to deal more damage, and strike at precise angles to devastate weak spots in enemy armour. When you’re surrounded by enemies, battles become a frantic and frenzied mix of careful observation and furious sword swinging. Each type of enemy has its own attack pattern that you’ll need to study and memorise. Keep an eye out for any enemies that are about to attack, then quickly turn to face them and unleash a flurry of melee attacks to keep the beast at bay. Juggling multiple enemies is a trying test of your time management, dexterity and reflexes. Chain together combos to build your Focus meter. When your Focus is maxed, activate the finishing Sever Mode for a chance to detach enemy limbs, then use them to upgrade a number of skills. If you successfully Sever a boss, you’ll be able to create sturdy armour from the spoils, granting you powerful new abilities. Incapacitate foes with the Blind ability, go into a fiery Rage to deal more damage, or Devour magical enemy buffs to use them as your own and dominate the opposition. Revisit areas with new powers to get a fresh perspective and find hidden secrets. Once you unlock the Charge Slash, you’ll be able to deliver more powerful strikes in combat and smash through obstructions that once blocked your path, opening up new areas. Experience a unique touch adventure that’s a cut above in Severed, an otherworldly dungeon-crawler for Nintendo eShop on Wii U.","Publisher":"Drinkbox Studios","ReleaseDate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"134345":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Utopian World of Sandwiches","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"5e490932-5363-4a4a-8e8c-4e814daf2f24.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f7885f27-850e-4d04-b369-ff893290a552.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0716c38f-00e4-4e30-8c82-cce2aace8cb0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Chompy Chomp Chomp Party","Overview":"Chompy Chomp Chomp Party is a fast and frantic game for up to 9 players.

Like other ones of Telltale Games's games, decisions that the player makes will impact events in both the current episode and later episodes. However, unlike Telltale's previous games, which tend to carry more mature or emotional overtones (including the death of major characters), Minecraft: Story Mode is intended to be a family-friendly title. As such, the decisions are intended to be pivotal and emotional, but not involve mature imagery or themes. Elements of crafting and building, central to Minecraft, were included in the gameplay. The game includes combat and other action sequences, carried out through both quick time events, similarly to Telltale Games's other episodic games, and more arcade-like controls, such as steering around debris on a road.","Publisher":"Telltale Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AGlKCsXbXMU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minecraft:_Story_Mode"},"143622":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Monster High: La Chica Nueva del Insti","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Little Orbit","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"32bff7e8-2deb-4b78-a693-5de632f2948a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3cb9ed3e-43e6-4bfb-8532-2abc194e938f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"79d3e283-3830-4c43-ba83-d6bf161609b3.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"57a5843d-dba6-4f16-86ce-a5468d3ff426.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44bab430-50fc-4b63-bcfb-80b393f4cf26.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Monster High: New Ghoul in School","Overview":"Roam the halls of Monster High in full 3D!

In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling for one to four players.\n\nMaking a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.","Publisher":"FarSight Technologies Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2016-01-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brunswick_Pro_Bowling"},"144988":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Ubisoft Paris","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"2b8067a9-458a-4a95-ba82-97956e3bb90c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"687aff04-24dd-462e-94b0-3957789b31f2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Just Dance 2017","Overview":"As in previous installments, players must mimic the routine of an on-screen dancer to a chosen song, scoring points based on their accuracy.

Levels are pseudo-procedurally-generated and separated into distinct regions, each region having different sets of challenges. The ship's speed remains constant as long as the ship remains in direct sunlight, but if the ship falls into shadow or clips objects, the ship's speed will drop. Direct collision with an object will cause the ship to be destroyed and end the run. Further, if the player's ship remains in shadow too long — such as when the sun finally sets — the ship will stall and the run will be over. The player continually earns points as long as the ship is moving. Throughout each region are various collectable objects. The most common are blue pyramids that, if five are collected without any collisions, will boost the player's scoring multiplier by one. Others give the player's ship a short speed boost, a single-time jump to clear obstacles, and a single-time use shield to prevent the ship's destruction on a direct collision. \n\nThere is also a larger meta-game feature that requires the player to complete various missions, three presented at any time, to earn experience points to build an experience level. Missions include scoring metrics, avoiding collisions during multiple regions, or colliding a number of times; some of which can be completed over multiple race attempts. Gaining a level grants a reward that helps in future races, such as starting with a higher scoring multiplier, gaining a booster for the ship to help collect powerups or store multiple jump boost, and the like. \n\nThere are three levels included as part of the core game: a standard level, an \"apocalypse\" level in which the player moves faster through more difficult obstacles, and a maze-style obstacle course played from a top-down perspective. These regions and levels change on a daily basis for all players, and online scoreboards allow users to compare their performance to others. The game also includes Steam Workshop integration, through which players can play levels created by other players.","Publisher":"Flippfly LLC","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Race_the_Sun_(video_game)"},"164516":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Frozenbyte","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d21d7d10-9177-493f-b309-96eef4567bad.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"77ea8381-0c6a-42cf-ac5c-a240fcae4d3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3cc5ce03-cb88-4642-a464-141e14ba94e2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d2897bca-bb57-4a1c-958f-f45ed5416483.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Trine: Enchanted Edition","Overview":"The player controls and switches between three different characters (a thief, a knight, and a wizard) to try to complete levels. There is also a cooperative play feature, whereby multiple players can join in at any time to control different characters simultaneously. Each character has their own health and energy meter. Energy is used for certain weapons and abilities, and is replenished by blue-colored bottles found throughout levels. Health is replenished by collecting heart-shaped containers, which result from destroying certain enemies. \n\nThe player also has a single experience rating that is shared among all characters, and is incremented by acquiring green-colored bottles found throughout levels. Every 50 experience points, each character is given one point towards the purchase of upgrades to their abilities. Treasure chests are also spread throughout levels, each containing a charm that offers the bearing character new or upgraded abilities. The player can transfer these objects between characters, though some will only have an effect on certain characters. \n\nCheckpoints are spread throughout levels, in the form of silver orbs on pedestals. Upon crossing a checkpoint, any deceased characters are brought back to life, and any characters below a certain amount of health and energy are replenished up to that amount. The amount of energy and health replenished is dependent upon the difficulty setting chosen by the player. When a character dies, the player must choose another living character to continue playing the level. If all three characters die, the player is sent back to the last checkpoint crossed, and all three characters are resurrected. \n\nEnemies primarily include walking skeletons, spiders, and bats, along with boss characters, like giant skeletons and other large creatures. Some skeletons are armed with swords, others with bows and arrows, some spit fire, and some have shields. Skeletons are capable of scaling walls. Other dangers include lava, fireballs, giant sharp pendulums, and various other booby traps.","Publisher":"Nobilis","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trine_(video_game)"},"164517":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Francisco Téllez de Meneses","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"528b16ae-b0ff-4058-9b0b-1e8dc98a7100.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7540f62c-5f19-4007-9a80-a319ae152245.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08904efa-5dc1-49f3-9186-a5b45f47a5bb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"UnEpic","Overview":"Unepic is a role-playing platformer and Metroidvania game, and includes a number of RPG elements, such as levels, skill points, and equipment.

He was a great videogame player, a big fan of sci-fi movies, and a novice RPG player. In the midst of an RPG, he was teleported to a castle. At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for the ride until his delirium comes to an end. \n\nOnce inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow. This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes. \n\nStruggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn.

The game was expanded and released to Microsoft Windows and OS X systems in July 2012. PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions with new content were released in April 2013, while a Linux version was released as part of the game's inclusion in The Humble Indie Bundle 8 in May 2013. The game was released for iPad devices in May 2014, and for other iOS devices and Android devices in July 2014. The game was also released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U in November 2014.\n\nIn the game, the player controls one or more simple rectangles representing several out-of-control artificial intelligence entities, working with the shapes to get each to their individual end points on each level. Each shape is characterized with a unique name and personality, including the eponymous Thomas, which are conveyed to the player through the use of a narrator, voiced by Danny Wallace and whose performance earned the game a BAFTA Games Award.\n\nThomas Was Alone takes place within a computer mainframe, where some unspecified \"Event\" has caused several artificial intelligence routines to run out of control and gain personalities. Each entity is represented by a simple coloured shape; the game's eponymous character is a simple red rectangle. Each shape has unique abilities; while all shapes can move left or right across platforms and perform jumps, the height of these jumps may be limited by the shape, or may have other abilities such as being able to float on water. When the player has access to two or more of these shapes, they can freely switch between them, controlling one shape at a time. \n\nThough the shapes themselves cannot be heard, the narrator describes the personalities and thoughts of each shape as the game progresses. \n\nThe goal on each level within the game is to direct the shapes to exit points specifically tied to each shape, so that they all simultaneously occupy this exit. This most often requires using the shape abilities together to manoeuvre them appropriately. A shape that cannot jump very high can be helped by creating a staircase from other shapes so that the shape can reach a higher platform, or the shape that can float can ferry the other shapes across water. A shape can be lost to several hazards, but it will reappear at the start of the level, or at a checkpoint if the shape has passed such a point.\n\nThere are ten sets of levels, each introducing a new character, with ten levels within each set.","Publisher":"Curve Digital Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thomas_Was_Alone"},"164568":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"VooFoo Studios","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"07e24f6a-cd3b-4f0c-b239-fc5d0460482d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"96fa4ed7-d0af-4d3e-9725-9b8c89ab4323.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ba6ca5d4-dcf6-498d-96da-3be24461f5a9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1645ad18-c9ea-46d2-a467-bee25a2f455f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"92c6a78d-d306-40d0-bee5-1b8f3ff6c9a0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pure Chess","Overview":"Chess like you're never seen it before!

Game elements include permadeath, randomized environments and enemies, random pick-ups, weapons, items and skills. The game has a fantasy theme and the protagonist is an apprentice of the Greyborn citadel, established by the Daedalon brothers wizards, where aspiring wizards are trained. Their final test is the Ziggurat where novices go to die or survive and become part of the citadel's inner circle.\n\nThe tower-like Ziggurat consists of several floors that need to be completed with a single life. The game has permadeath but it is possible to save progress after completing a floor to continue another time. The game emphasizes fast-paced movement including sprinting, jumping and using platforms in the environment, fighting against large hordes in small rooms, but optionally auto-aiming can be enabled. Each floor is generated with a random pattern and it consists of several floors linked together by corridors. To complete a level a guardian boss needs to be defeated, but it can only be summoned when a portal key has first been located elsewhere. A typical room spawns a large amount of minions that need to be defeated before the doors open again. There is a chance of a random effect when entering a room, for instance creating larger enemies, doing more damage, making them invisible etc.\n\nOther types of rooms that can be part of a floor are a treasure room with a powerful item, a hazard room where an environmental hazard needs to be avoided, a shrine where health or mana can be offered to the gods in exchange for an additional effect or modifier, and a lore room where an ancient scroll can be found, providing knowledge. Each floor also has a secret room hidden behind a cracked wall. Inside one of two skills can be chosen and it also shows information about one of the developer's earlier games.\n\nAt the start the player chooses one of several characters with different statistics and modifiers, presented as different classes, but only one is available in the beginning as the others are unlocked gradually. The default weapons is a magic wand that shoots projectiles. It has unlimited ammo, but requires some time for ammo to be refilled entirely. Three additional types of weapons can be picked up, tied to three limited mana sources. Each mana source offers several weapons per type, but only one per type can be carried at all times, so a maximum of four weapons in total. At the start of a floor a new weapon is always offered to optionally pick up or exchange. Each weapon has a regular attack, and a powerful attack that consumes more. Weapons include staffs, grenades, homing projectiles, charges that freeze opponents etc. They all use ranged attacks so the character needs to keep a distance, but still needs to move in to collect the items left behind by defeated enemies before they vanish.\n\nUnlike many roguelike games the game emphasizes combat skills to survive instead of relying on the randomness of provided items. By defeating enemies and for instance locating lore, experience is gained to level up. The character becomes stronger, but with each new level a selection between two random skills is offered so the player has a choice what skills or perks to use. Examples of skills are improved health or mana, reduced consumption rates, additional health for entering a new room or breaking objects, more or less loot drops, amulets to receive health or mana at a specific moment etc. Defeated enemies also leave behind health, mana and other types of objects. After each game session additional weapons, items, characters, skills, game modes and difficulty levels are unlocked gradually, to use in a next one.","Publisher":"Milkstone Studios","ReleaseDate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ziggurat_(2014_video_game)"},"168550":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"FIFA Soccer 13","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"EA Canada","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"fa11e7fd-9a93-4c80-9511-0b29efee2b20.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f59d3feb-38cc-417c-8d21-5b7c1479628e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c9e34f91-b023-436f-97b3-255d4a164f09.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b2e08ea2-2c70-41dd-83f4-2985fe078fd8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"767e807a-8881-4495-a7c9-886bc46d4bf3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30f1e9d6-d6d8-43a6-a1e3-ccf0eb9a1006.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"88b9059b-f582-4da4-afc6-ea4b7833b218.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":10,"Name":"FIFA 13","Overview":"FIFA 13 (also known as FIFA Soccer 13 in North America) is the 2012 edition of Electronic Arts' association football FIFA video game series and was developed by EA Canada.

But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare.\n\nMother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to \"dash\", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects\/characters).\n\nThere are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have \"rolling HP meters\"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as \"DP\"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects.\n\nThere are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.","Publisher":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9GYWZeDIqhg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mother_3"},"182102":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Double Fine Productions","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f4a7cec3-e66e-4e38-bb70-af3fdea6d938.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b5330198-27a2-4319-b40c-0c5dd36463e3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ecb254c-5af9-4747-bbd3-065390b88f07.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Costume Quest 2","Overview":"Trick, treat and pick a fight with villainous dental soldiers in Costume Quest 2, the sweet sequel to Double Fine’s hit original, Costume Quest, that turned fans of all ages into candy obsessed crusaders.
