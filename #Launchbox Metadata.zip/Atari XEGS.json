Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\nArchon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbOgSY-rJ0","Platform":"Atari XEGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Board Game","Developer":"Free Fall Associates","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"23beb166-095d-41d2-a0bf-7dadcfd36a70.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"9556bbbc-3cca-4736-b4c1-eba3aee66f8d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"a76035a9-22b8-4cdc-b0ef-519ff7e6a831.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"e4106a91-3454-45d3-98b0-f2403c0e5223.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"c191d042-3454-4279-a6e8-87a3c4351d86.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"5d28eff7-7bea-4f6e-9091-a4d2495006ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"329e7112-ce55-4ac0-87cc-1b965f6f29aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"52eb749d-9dd9-45cd-a8f7-925ed4003aa2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5726,"FileName":"ea934b3e-bb60-4d82-adde-26dfe6f6a1ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29850,"Name":"Ballblazer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ballblazer is a 1984 computer game created by Lucasfilm Games (later LucasArts Entertainment).

This game was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC DOS. A similar game inspired by Ballblazer called Space Football: One on One was developed and released by Triffix for the Super NES in 1992.

These modes do not require the same level of knowledge.\n\nFlight Simulator II is packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace. In this game the plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.

The object of the game is to eat an ice cream cone located on the opposite side of an open playfield. The ice cream is slowly melting, and must be consumed before it melts completely. Standing between Charley and the ice cream are four chefs named Angelo, Jacques, Oscar, and Zorba.\n\nThe chefs appear from holes in the floor of the level and will chase after Charley. The chefs are identified by the shape of their toques: Angelo's is short and rectangular; Jacques' is curved; Oscar's is big and round; and Zorba's is tall and slender.\n\nScattered throughout the level are piles of food, such as pies, peas, tomatoes, and bananas. Both the player and the chefs can grab food from the piles to throw at each other. The supplies of most foods are limited, but watermelon, which appears either on special levels exclusively or with other foods in later levels, is unlimited in supply. If the chefs are hit by food thrown either by the player or by other chefs, they are taken down for a few seconds. If the player is hit, a life is lost. The player also loses a life if a chef touches Charley, if Charley falls through an open hole, or if the ice cream melts before it is eaten.\n\nPoints are scored for each chef hit by food thrown by the player (up to 1,000 points each), luring a chef over an open hole and for each remaining pile of food on the level. The ice cream is worth 500 points multiplied by the level number, up to a maximum of 25,000 points from level 50 onwards to the last regular level, level 125. If the player has at least one close call with flying food and a chef, the game will present the player with an instant replay of that level.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuumFyfIU4c","Platform":"Atari XEGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Atari Corporation","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"d3f2cfff-eff5-44e4-8a55-757f0c02b12f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"6d3c2f09-399a-434d-a857-bea2fb7a5a5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"2cbd8d6c-2643-45da-ad7d-06c3b3c869ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"00fbc844-e558-4164-805f-9f51c8e5d97a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"27f1765c-8498-4ad6-bfae-517facf32885.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"4bf71e6f-3d71-4278-b5c5-bfeddefc418d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"56d762fa-217e-406b-a7ed-c27d265acdd1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"714d19e0-0f14-490b-8c9c-ec7329c4cae4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35193,"FileName":"f2de63ca-3e55-4e85-bb91-be4938814dd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123738,"Name":"GATO","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"GATO is a real-time submarine simulator first published in 1984 by Spectrum HoloByte for MS-DOS.

The player has a selection of pitchers to choose from. Each team member has his own statistics that affect his performance, and can be rearranged as desired.

Due to the varied terrain, the direction finder has to be used to locate the pilots, whose visual beacons are often masked by mountain ridges.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbZ-chrOgGg","Platform":"Atari XEGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"20c05acc-8922-47dd-8451-6da68bf0f470.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"2db0809a-b5db-40b9-9e13-a0f26a55a811.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"a034e2da-9090-4b7f-93cd-b32f57949c68.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"cc97a37f-843f-423f-b34d-b83a55ae5375.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"824ec0c1-428f-466f-a442-32f9dbcb85ba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"a2ad259b-7750-43e7-b446-e0599001a18a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"51f4fa80-8f87-4835-9d87-56577ed45340.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123736,"FileName":"c6340704-a0c5-4d69-9dd3-df184055144d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195246,"Name":"River Raid: Cold Winter","ReleaseYear":"2019","Overview":"River Raid \"Cold Winter\", as the name makes it clear, brings completely new graphics with a winter scenery.

The game was originally developed as part of a tie-in with the movie The Last Starfighter, which featured an arcade game of the same name as part of its plotline. Versions for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit computers were developed in 1984, although those were never released. Later the tie-in was dropped, and the game converted into a sequel to Star Raiders by changing a number of gameplay elements. The gameplay remained quite different from the original Star Raiders.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iabq8cSmYiE","Platform":"Atari XEGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari Corporation","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"494a119d-96d5-4e9f-89bf-b213376cd0a1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"dd5bd776-3eac-484d-aa7f-a7ad6a839d7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"80c69000-76ac-41dd-a900-2bea912768c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"c4da0cb3-e903-4944-b520-387f0ca2e03a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"47bd2080-ff3a-4b09-8f62-6842ec13cf78.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"7e089b9a-4d2a-410d-b6d4-2f35be723280.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"babc6d78-ebf3-443b-86a8-95d0ededa165.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"1d13cd3b-1d9f-408f-bb0a-00c6fce8872d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35203,"FileName":"5df66c9a-38c8-4fa1-a0d5-29c2d32fce4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":35204,"Name":"Summer Games","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The game is presented as a virtual multi-sport competition called the \"Epyx Games\" (there was no official IOC licensing in place) with up to eight players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal.","MaxPlayers":"3","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8v-P6bsIOM","Platform":"Atari XEGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Epyx, Inc.","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"a7540ab2-63b0-4fd4-a422-9f574c498dfa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"dcb18116-fe33-4f2c-ae6a-f2ff21509cae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"8bb2c03d-1e28-43c1-9a4b-558bc1249448.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"7fcaa53e-5891-4f9f-9b01-23703d8c1c76.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"2ca4bedf-a2a4-4ceb-a284-1bf366843c7f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"795c7317-b5bb-43dd-9252-6ce956c37170.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35204,"FileName":"6ae31a85-6b67-4f7f-8a27-c1bd21536604.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":35194,"Name":"ThunderFox","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"A heavily defended transporter carries Disilicate Energy Crystals for the approaching Phalon Mothership. Once installed, these will power the deadly Phalon War machine said to be capable of destroying entire solar systems in minutes. The Federation's only hipe is the latest in the slick, maneuverable space fighters: THUNDERFOX!\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to locate and destroy these crystals, thus preventing the War Machine from being built.\nYou must take care to avoid deadly lasers and lengthy exposure to dangerous radiation as you navigate your way to the Disilicate Energy Crystal Room. Once there, you will face the fearsome Crystal Guardian which must be destroyed along with the crystals it guards, by firing at its vulnerable, pulsating head.\nThere's no time to waste! If the Guardian is not destroyed before the Phalon Mothership reaches the transporter, a death missle will be fired, annihilating THUNDERFOX and your Mothership. The solar system will be left defenseless and doomed to imminent destruction!\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay for Thunder Fox is similar to other popular side scrolling action games like Namco's Rolling Thunder (video game), and Sega's Shinobi (arcade game). There are three buttons for each player - Attack, which normally is used to make Thunder and Fox (the game's heroes) stab with their knives. Jump, and a Weapon button which fires or throws a weapon acquired by the heroes.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that the game gives players the opportunity to allow players to use their obtained weapons (save for the hand grenades) as melee weapons which helps conserve ammunition for when it's needed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_g_tPfMclo","Platform":"Atari XEGS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Aztec Design","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"fea74242-29f1-4658-bbb9-d2e788fdf2d0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"42ad4507-e1e4-4828-b755-42dd3d650e02.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"5dbeefa3-2e8c-42f6-8c61-ab1dcab94206.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"76d1ee2c-c31e-4014-9131-9bcec20ea336.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"a4e158a9-50bf-45eb-bbdd-c7faf6571c98.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"7c89a4ca-a82f-4e21-8afa-35d421511883.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35194,"FileName":"9328562d-4bc4-4beb-861a-e419f213f649.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":35194,"AlternateName":"Thunder Fox","Region":null}]}]}
