Your character is a cyborg equipped with various weapons; initially, you only have a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers).\n\nWhile you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you'll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more.\n\nApart from ammo and health, you can also find upgrades which have a number of beneficial effect - increasing your running speed, for example.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform; Puzzle; Shooter","Developer":"Crack dot Com","Publisher":"R-Comp Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129725,"FileName":"9a839765-afa4-4484-b222-bdc59c98a629.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129725,"FileName":"fea5e4ff-0e7f-4417-84cb-b0bad56e1e52.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129725,"FileName":"e610b77c-b8b0-471e-aa75-7e96f678e689.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":129726,"Name":"Acheton","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Acheton was written by Jon Thackray, David Seal and Jonathan Partington.

They have taken over a number of planets and it is your job to destroy the Rakonan colonies on these planets to an extent that they cannot survive and the planet is then 'sterlised'. It can then be re-colonised by the original inhabitants.\n\nUpon starting the game your craft descends to the planet surface and the battle begins. There are plenty of things to destroy, mainly on the ground, but from time to time you will come under attack from flying saucers and other things in the sky. You are initially based on the ground, but it is possible take off and fly your craft around in the air. However your craft's energy is drained much quicker when flying so to recharge the energy levels you need to return to ground level and stay still for a while.\n\nYour craft is protected by shields and they can take a number of hits before they are finally destroyed. Shields can be recharged by moving your craft away from enemy fire. Once the shields have been destroyed one single enemy shot will finish you off.\n\nAs you progress around the landscape you will encounter buildings and objects, all of which can be destroyed. However some don't need to be, for example there are small houses which can be flattened but these are harmless so you don't really need to worry about them too much. You should pay more attention to the other objects that fire back at you - these need to disposed of as soon as you see them.\n\nWhen you have destroyed enough objects on the planet to sterilise it the mission will end. You will then be presented before the Royal Guild of Spacing who will assess your performance. You will also end up here when your game ends. There are nine planets to sterilise and at the start of the game only one is available so you have to complete each of the planets in order to gain access to the next one.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Gordon Key","Publisher":"The Fourth Dimension","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124594,"FileName":"e328c982-9bb7-4385-8463-7dad446600b1.png","Type":"Box -

As the protagonist explores the streets and souvenir shops, certain people, animals and objects begin exhibiting strange behavior; finally, the surroundings become completely unfamiliar, and the inhabitants' English unusually rich and poetic... the stage is set for an exploration of this strange land, in an attempt to find a way out. The happenings take place over three different calendar dates; the game world is a blend of places and characters from Shakespeare's plays, but as the authors reassure us, \"an exhaustive knowledge of the Shakespearean Canon is not necessary\".\n\nMonsters of Murdac is billed as a bonus game, in which an expatriate known only as George takes a flight from England back to his native land of Murdac. Here he meets a mysterious old lady remembered from his childhood, rumored to be a witch (in any case, she's at least somewhat unconventional). A stop at her strangely-furnished home proves fateful, as the hero finds himself sent on a quest deep into the foreboding forest of Murdac.

What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in Arkanoid it's possible to pick up various power ups. These including giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle.\n\nEvery fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to Gyruss. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible.

These are called power blocks and appear randomly as part of tetrominoes and are activated when a row consisting of one is cleared. There are four different power blocks: four lines, filler, shooter, bomb and 16 ton weight. Four lines removes up to four incomplete lines from the playfield. Filler replaces the next tetromino with a little alien that the player controls and drops single blocks. It can be used to fill in holes in partially finished lines. The shooter does the opposite and shoots away unwanted blocks. The bomb is used to blow up a section of the playfield. The 16 ton weight removes three columns of blocks when dropped on the playfield.\n\n\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode where two players complete side by side on a split screen. A special feature in the multiplayer mode is that if one player completes more than one line with a piece the lines are passed to the opponent.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Steven Singer","Publisher":"Public Domain/Freeware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158972,"FileName":"6b4a8b7c-5c08-4a08-8e3e-4b2643bc3eb7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158972,"FileName":"504cf27c-9ff5-40f6-a1ba-4569113736fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":129761,"Name":"Bobby Blockhead vs the Dark Planet","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"An arcade adventure platformer game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Atomic Software","Publisher":"Atomic Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"4384e777-f9a4-4fde-96bb-bc809a25ed76.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"86381554-bee2-4d26-bcbc-d8c1fa1c4810.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"18116613-820e-4285-be1b-d5c735fd620b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"84f73cfd-581c-4e08-8dc1-d15079706743.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"7e5d04cc-082f-42bf-9ca2-fbc1506a0982.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"c1ac8af1-88bd-4e66-8a29-a2cd0a9b9a62.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129761,"FileName":"85a15e55-3f5f-4d2e-9589-1f61a90a520d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":129759,"Name":"Bodywise","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Sherston","Publisher":"Sherston","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129759,"FileName":"b10b5e64-893d-47f2-854e-bc1a194e653b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129759,"FileName":"4ec9a7a8-1253-4fca-98f5-fb66a0a88034.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":129760,"Name":"Boogie Buggy","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Boogie has arrived at Dodge City only to find that the Evil Monster Lord has taken control and has set about converting power-ore into evil-ore. He is using this to turn all the good in Dodge City into evil. As his power increases he starts to turn Dodge City into a stronghold for creatures of the darkness and other evil monsters and is plotting to take control of Bumper World.\n\nIt is up to Boogie to put a stop to these evil plans. To do this you must travel across Dodge City counteracting the effect of evil-ore in each zone, you must also destroy each of the evil Ore Conversion Plants before finally coming face to face with the Evil Monster Lord himself.\n\nThere are two types of level in the game, The Ore Conversion Plants - viewed from the side, and the City locations - viewed from above.\n\nIn the City locations, the object is to collect all the pieces of evil-ore (of which there are 10) and then drop them down a manhole, then move around the level and collect the next piece of evil-ore and then drop that down a manhole. The process is repeated until the level is cleared of evil and is then good again.\nThere are many bonuses to collect throughout the levels. In addition to the evil-ore there are plasters which will reduce your damage percentage, make sure you collect these at every opportunity as it is very easy to get Boogie damaged. Other pick ups include extra lives, turbo boosts, and bonus points.\nThere's also a chainsaw which will become attached to the front of Boogie and is very useful for disposing of evil monsters, and banana skins which will send Boogie sliding about for a few seconds.\n\nThe Ore Conversion Plant levels are a bit more straight forward, you start at the bottom of the screen and you must guide Boogie to the top of the screen to destroy the Ore Converter. This is achieved by reaching the polarity switch, and reversing it and then make your escape before everything blows up. When all the zones have been completed you will then enter the mine in the heart of the city and face the Evil Monster Lord and must defeat him to complete the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"The Fourth Dimension","Publisher":"The Fourth Dimension","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129760,"FileName":"d9fa6f3e-9a90-4b71-957e-f29e317159b0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":129760,"FileName":"4f7f196a-7e31-47b4-8c28-92b74ad0dc8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131595,"Name":"Botkiller 2","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":"Botkiller2 is a sideways scrolling platform game in which you control a Special Forces Trooper and must save a skyscraper belonging to SpaceTronic Inc from malfunctioning.

However you have to complete a number of tasks before the exit is accessible. For example, on the first level you need to get a blue key card to open a door in front of the exit.\nIn order to get to the exit of the level, you need to work your way round it. This is done by using lifts, teleporters and destroying droids that get in the way. As you progress, the levels get bigger and become more difficult to complete.\nThe game includes break points (pink dots).\nCanisters can be shot to obtain extra pick ups and coins. Collect the coins and then when you visit the shop you can use them to buy new items and weapons to help you in your mission. There are various types of canister; the standard grey ones which contain nothing, the ones with red on contain coins, and the ones with blue on contain items and bonuses.

The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.\n\nLike in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely.

Things didn't go right however. After a DNA mixup they instead ended up with a tiny spineless and two legged creature hardly capable of harming any creature. So rather than having it fighting on the battlefields it was decided that it should instead be used for insect extermination. The game is a puzzle platformer. Hysteon Proteron has sucker feet that allows it to walk on walls and ceilings but lacks any weapons. Instead it has to pick up objects that it has to drop onto the insects. If it comes into contact with the insects the player loses one of three lives. Once all insects are dead the player leaves the level and moves on to the next.\n\nMoon Dash takes place in the year 4244 where human colonists have been in war with the alien race known as the Judhs for many years. The player is transporting a PR 64 planet ranger to the capital when numerous alien ships appear above him. The objective of the game is to drive the PR 64 through 16 zones until reaching the city. The game is side scrolling and the player drives his vehicle on the ground while alien space ships try to crash into him from above. While trying to avoid being hit the player can use his turret to shoot back at the aliens. At the same time he has to jump over various obstacles on the ground.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Ian Richardson","Publisher":"Minerva","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"42bcbd0f-c794-454d-b89d-1a4a018ffc4c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"c1000599-4224-475c-9616-ce8eeb233041.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"26269c46-dfc8-4280-8651-e86646901a55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"c7592005-cc39-411c-bd4e-bc829a8c9cd4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"11fd2339-e6c2-49e6-81dd-a5ea9680ef63.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"f11ea8cb-ec24-4e56-81cd-d413e8b5b972.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"dc463929-3026-4716-9dc9-4b0c60897321.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130358,"FileName":"4262009f-4fde-4f5f-a5ce-925c81e07322.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":130358,"AlternateName":"Bug Hunter & Moon Dash","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":129767,"Name":"Bug Hunter in Space","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Bug Hunter in Space is a sequel to the original Bug Hunter game.

However there is a bit more to this task than simply shutting them down, you have to collect all of the power crystals on each level. Once this is achieved then head to the exit and the level is complete and the reactor can be closed down. To obtain the crystals you need to destroy the crystal bases. When a base is destroyed the crystal will appear and float around the screen until it is collected.\n\nYou will encounter numerous hazards on your mission to obtain the crystals. Most notably the defence systems which will shoot at you should you get near them, so blast them away before they do the same to you. On later levels you have to shoot pressure points to make doors open to let you into other parts of the level.\n\nThere is also the added factor of gravity so should you not maintain thrust your craft will plummet towards the bottom of the screen, and if it hits anything then you will lose a life. \n\nDuring the game when you destroy aliens and defence systems, bonus credits will appear.

The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.\n\nElite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).\n\nThe Acorn Archimedes version, ArcElite (1991), written by Warren Burch & Clive Gringras and regarded by Stuff magazine as the best conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using polygon mesh graphics in place of the wire-frames. The game world no longer seems to be centered around the player; freighter fleets with escorts go about their own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual really can be found in the Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although Dredgers and Generation Ships are confirmed not to exist in Archimedes Elite).

Along the way you will encounter many enemies both on the ground and in the air, all of which need to be destroyed. There are also a number of land obstacles including bombs, spikes and snowballs. Again these can be disposed of by shooting at them, or you can jump over them instead. You can also avoid enemies by crouching down and let them fly overhead. Some of the snowballs are quite tricky to destroy and it proves to be much easier to simply crouch down and let them fly by overhead.\n\nAll creatures and obstacles which are destroyed will leave behind bonuses, some just add to your score, but others can be very useful and add more power to your weapon. Make sure you collect any hearts that appear as these will top up your energy levels, however they don't increase the number of lives you have. Whatever you do don't pick up the skull as this will do the opposite to the hearts and drain your energy levels.\n\nYou start the game with 2 spare lives, each life has an energy bar which when it runs out means you lose a life. Beware as this energy bar level can drop really quickly sometimes if you run into a large pack of badies. Luckily there are bombs you can pick up which will clear all the enemies on the screen in one go. You can also pick up temporary invulnerability shields and a freeze potion which will temporarily freeze anything on the screen which will give you a chance to dispose of everything a bit more easily.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"The Fourth Dimension","Publisher":"The Fourth Dimension","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125025,"FileName":"7e86912c-3f90-4443-adb3-7cec29d62179.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125025,"FileName":"83386c94-3d43-4ad6-8df5-22ef16478859.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125025,"FileName":"650a6867-c24a-4ecc-aa22-b014e721eef4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125025,"FileName":"9c6111b8-e9d4-490a-adee-097b18494962.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125025,"FileName":"ccf2d0f0-967b-455f-a57f-2df7e05af2d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":129798,"Name":"E-Type","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"E-Type is a racing game similar to Outrun where the player gets to drive the titular sports car (although without the Jaguar license).

Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations.

Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three lands: the land of men (Midgard), the land of giants (Utgard) and the land of the gods (Asgard). You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these lands to collect the god's weapons. Each land has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.\n\nWhen you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party.

However by picking up a collectable the ability to hover in the air is granted. There are two different hover collectables which decide how high the sphere can move vertically. Another collectable is the missile which allows the sphere to shoot monsters and blast through blocks. Some missile collectables only make it possible to shoot in one direction and a second one has to be collected to be able to shoot both left and right. The monsters are called Ibbles and Squibbles and will kill the sphere on contact. Other dangers include spikes but these can be reversed by picking up the right collectable. Oxygen is limited and a level has to be completed before it runs out although more can be collected.\n\nThe game contains eight levels where the objective is to collect all diamonds. Upon the completion of one a password is given which allows the player to start on the next one. After all eight levels have been completed the game moves on to a final level called the Castle of Gribb. The objective there is to collect 500 feathers that are needed to build two giant wings used to fly home. In the castle there is a new enemy type, the Gribbles, who grow and multiply uncontrollably.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Stephen Kett","Publisher":"Minerva","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130021,"FileName":"30f595cd-e8a5-4600-9690-eafe538a9da9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130021,"FileName":"c8eeda98-bf16-4680-bc51-08f812a1264f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130021,"FileName":"ca26b83d-793e-4e69-82e4-043da9c85162.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":130021,"FileName":"b98aac5a-7a44-4f86-89ce-2f3536df88ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130021,"FileName":"684dffd8-7d08-4390-9eeb-6815770eef71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130022,"Name":"Humanoids and Robotix","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A two game collection comprising Humanoids and Robotix.\nHumanoids is a version of the game Defender.\nRobotics is an adventure by Robico.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"CIS","Publisher":"CIS","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130022,"FileName":"9df44967-d022-43ad-898e-7508edfb9daa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130022,"FileName":"dac7bb35-6045-4001-9423-d0063a18a335.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130023,"Name":"Ibix the Viking","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Ibix the Viking is an Action Adventure game, developed and published by Minerva, which was released in Europe in 1990\n\nThe player has to collect all the treasure (crowns, coins and chests) in each level.

His boss, who happens to be his (now ex-) father-in-law, fires him.

However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.\n\nAcross the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.\n\nThe others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.\n\nUnlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems.\n\nBecause there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress.

It takes place in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.\n\nYou are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint. Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.\n\nYou have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit from the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip.\n\nYou can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Krisalis Software","Publisher":"Krisalis Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130495,"FileName":"7e507270-c0ef-4525-bad8-1768d9571ec0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130495,"FileName":"f18400ff-6999-40fd-b96c-d0077ba0e1d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130495,"FileName":"e11702ec-084c-49f4-b3ae-9fdb29dd9024.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":130495,"FileName":"d1abd884-7878-40ca-947d-b6a3f226cdf4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130495,"FileName":"e7f748fb-6502-4458-a1c2-34f7df27882c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130495,"FileName":"e8a4c858-98d3-428b-a7c5-aa05aac0a7e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130040,"Name":"Mad Professor Mariarti","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist.

Both United and the opposition can be player or computer-controlled. Players dribble automatically and shoot when the fire button is released - the strength of kick determined by the time fire was held down. In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick. In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX.

It is based on the Greek myth where King Minos sent a group of young Athenians to be fed by the Minotaur in the Labyrinth of Crete. The player's task is to enter the labyrinth, save as many men as possible and then escape before getting killed. The player has to reach the men before the minotaur or else they will die. The labyrinth is randomly generated at start up and it's possible for the player to enter its size.\n\nWhile moving around the labyrinth the player will come across various items that can be picked up. Most common are the food cans and the bottles which are necessary to avoid thirst or starvation. There are also compasses and pieces of a map that make it easier to find a way through the labyrinth.

The game's world is open ended and consists of over 200 interconnected screens.

Some objects can simply be picked up from the ground while others can only be acquired by solving puzzles or trading with NPCs. Some characters also send the player out on errands in exchange for a reward. Often these are fetch quests where the player has to bring back certain objects. Puzzles generally involve activating objects at the right location or to combine them with other objects. Clues and quests are given on parchments that the player can find all around the world. The player takes damage when bumping into certain characters. At the start of the game the player is unarmed and can't defend himself but after doing some puzzles weapons will become available. Weapons are equipped from an inventory (consisting of an maximum of eight objects) and are used with the same activate button that is used for puzzles. Since the player is a sorcerer he can also create magical staffs and scrolls by mixing different objects in a cauldron.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"The Fourth Dimension","Publisher":"The Fourth Dimension","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"bae4cd85-c723-4232-bee4-271cd047f33a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"c3b19e1b-ffc4-49cb-927e-303f5a86ac62.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"57273105-dc0c-42a6-99fe-2065500a08f0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"ba4af3f7-579c-40b6-b8fd-39f5134570ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"14313247-db81-4a50-9acf-bf708849246d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"d1502447-06e7-4f33-9fb5-e829fde151c7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"e91051ef-04b0-42b7-a4a4-9094f12ee56a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"24bf4497-72ab-4ba4-b178-4ad98597f42e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"afb477b6-862b-4e2b-aebf-7ae509466431.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"f6787c06-807a-4a2f-826a-737d1916eabd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122749,"FileName":"7857bc52-5a70-4ce8-b128-7ec51e3d10c2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130091,"Name":"Paradroid 2000","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".\n\nThe game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"The Assembly Line","Publisher":"Empire Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130094,"FileName":"72d7975f-34c8-4608-924f-1c0259e37582.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130094,"FileName":"ca8ff25e-d14f-400b-ae65-f614d13aa8c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130094,"FileName":"19732e95-9347-49ca-8530-5f2a1e9c6669.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130094,"FileName":"15a98b26-869a-47eb-b5bc-8031012a8e6a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":130094,"AlternateName":"Pipe Dream","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":131480,"Name":"Play it Again Sam 2","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"A compilation of four previously released games: ArcPinball, Master Break, Repton 2 and Zarch.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131480,"FileName":"e073eb20-fa14-49a8-a3f1-fe6a773566af.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131480,"FileName":"697e4780-d02c-4ea8-adb7-833787a11702.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131480,"FileName":"f8080df9-c2dc-428e-916f-3c0ac772f6e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130095,"Name":"Play it Again Sam 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A four game compilation featuring Letrouve, Superior Golf, Top Banana, and Zelanites the Onslaught.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130095,"FileName":"08c714f2-e63e-4bf1-bb7e-92eb299807a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130095,"FileName":"ce63d5c2-f351-4dd1-8bb1-2927ae738e41.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130096,"Name":"Poizone","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme.

Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.\n\nSuccessful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.\n\nThe game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Maxis","Publisher":"Krisalis Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130452,"FileName":"e77c5863-7c11-4346-8dd3-6a4134bc1feb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130452,"FileName":"bd7575e3-7a0b-443f-a419-e870fc1ac1ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130452,"FileName":"06ebf4a0-2341-4c79-b9d6-7d7fd8b68702.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130420,"Name":"Simon the Sorcerer","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.\n\nSimon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.\n\nLike in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Adventuresoft","Publisher":"Gamesware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130420,"FileName":"815afadd-437f-4fc6-b759-292bbb7cd9f0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130420,"FileName":"4abe25bf-0ff0-4acc-8a01-e7947eaf0d87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130420,"FileName":"3bd93044-9954-4b90-889a-a0bb37d9f7d4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130422,"Name":"Slappit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A game along the lines of Ballistix, where you have to guide a ball into your opponents goal, traversing a pitch littered with odd obstacles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"RTFM Software","Publisher":"RTFM Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130422,"FileName":"e368450f-6cac-44e0-8d3f-6cab4c94b28a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130422,"FileName":"c8e74329-5151-442e-8972-f1d3c8e02874.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131140,"Name":"Small","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"In this game the player has been shrunk to microscopic size and must travel through the mazes battling various creatures in an attempt to find the exit before his time runs out.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"D J Hoskins","Publisher":"Virgo Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131140,"FileName":"13883a4f-f621-411d-a399-a23b6daa3ca4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131140,"FileName":"a04beac7-6eed-456d-9624-f3d8bd2b6990.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131140,"FileName":"c9fcbe22-1255-4256-b115-7e53ffa101bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131140,"FileName":"85d083b5-4780-4ede-8621-4c8916920fbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131140,"FileName":"3b0b1873-4fa0-4bc0-a10f-594237695810.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131140,"FileName":"3d81017a-7d7b-4022-9357-3f7291cee57e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130424,"Name":"Soft Rock Software","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130424,"FileName":"4940cb5d-72a7-4902-90d5-26b0ecf46c18.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177699,"Name":"Son of Gyrinus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORLoSkytV00&ab_channel=FunCade64","Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Tom Cooper","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177699,"FileName":"f070303b-e1b5-42fe-8fc2-26d6f53eea51.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177699,"FileName":"5a06e23e-b37a-416f-b182-663d132a9ceb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":177699,"FileName":"7d6aa7f0-323f-4035-91f5-c3156c501917.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":177699,"FileName":"0fe51c31-39ab-4699-a31b-507de5f4c65d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124948,"Name":"Speedball 2","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen.

As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.\n\nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.\n\nThe sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.\n\nYou get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.\n\nA variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5IgjxxOu0","Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Krisalis Software","Publisher":"Krisalis Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124948,"FileName":"6ec23a99-ee94-4abd-8343-a62dee9d355e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124948,"FileName":"2b75edb8-877d-4e90-bd1c-979d4b38d0b9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124948,"FileName":"90bb1790-080a-4904-858f-19f290e2c723.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":124948,"AlternateName":"Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":131122,"Name":"Spheres of Chaos","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"An Asteroids style game where you battle against the spheres of chaos and also alien creatures.

The more of these you collect the more powerful your spacecraft will become. These collectables include shields, mines, bigger guns, faster firepower and protective droids which you can fire in front of your craft to clear the way ahead for you.\n\nThere are 18 different levels, each divided up into zones, and they are passworded so you can skip early levels and get straight back into the action where you lost your last life. At the end of each level you have to defeat the 'end of level boss', in order to move onto the next level.\n\nUnlike in Nevryon, now when you lose a life you just carry on, minus that life, but you do still lose the power ups you collected.\n\nAnother new feature is the introduction of a two player mode. This is a proper two player mode where both players are on screen at the same time, not waiting for your turn whilst the other person plays. You can team up together to complete the levels or play against each other.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Psyche","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132821,"FileName":"b71ddcda-c6d6-41b1-be0c-d46665f67557.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132821,"FileName":"0f08f180-c1b8-4521-9378-ff1044b52e40.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132821,"FileName":"4dd95a45-7668-4531-810a-a899446ee5fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132821,"FileName":"290407be-f86d-4e9e-aa86-89993bb71bdb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132821,"FileName":"366c4c69-7d28-4619-beee-2fcfaa1f75fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132821,"FileName":"cf907131-1c5b-4d92-b3f2-d96fde41d6ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132902,"Name":"Terramex","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"An arcade adventure game in which you play as one of the world's five top explorers and undertake a hazardous journey to find Professor Eyestrain and deflect the meteor to which only he has the solution.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","Publisher":"Krisalis Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132902,"FileName":"6fcdcbb9-3751-4e63-977e-a20be8b3bac2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132902,"FileName":"efda8f43-4cc0-4fa5-ba27-0ca853fc5720.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132902,"FileName":"3a0642ae-8821-4da3-8007-6ad518e50be9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132902,"FileName":"d5a1274d-2953-4ffa-ac99-ba0a35ea24f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132902,"FileName":"3de68b8b-7cea-41b1-b69e-db02d976c09d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132902,"FileName":"f50e86b7-6eb6-4660-86b4-6edfb3a8e3fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130440,"Name":"The Adventure Collection","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Alpine Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130440,"FileName":"f0e27c50-08ed-4114-bf0d-41f7cd46567c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130440,"FileName":"54d99bb4-c0ce-4ef6-91e0-af18e985d263.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130441,"Name":"The Arc/A3000 Winter Box","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"PON!

The player takes control of one such young man, Kanu, who sets out to find a temple located deep within a mountain. It is believed that entombed in the temple is an elixir that can save the natives.

To kill the enemies Kanu has an unlimited supply of axes (similar to Wonder Boy and Adventure Island) that can be thrown. Other weapons can be acquired by picking up green or blue shields. The green shield gives a mace while the blue shield gives a bolt of magic. Other collectibles include gems that give bonus points and various potions that give increased abilities such as higher jumps, temporary invulnerability, increases fire rate, freeze monsters and provide extra lives. When starting out Kanu has four lives and a limited amount of life blood. Life blood is drained when contact with enemies are made and when it is all gone a life is lost.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Eterna","Publisher":"Eterna","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126877,"FileName":"8e672983-dbe1-486e-81b9-bc88e466e2cd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126877,"FileName":"576f88ae-8d4d-4bd1-97bb-c652c93d7248.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126877,"FileName":"2ebf0fb6-9618-4439-ad86-95fb335bc3f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126877,"FileName":"3cad75f3-8915-46f0-aa63-7e22270b538f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126877,"FileName":"0e140b27-ea17-42e2-8bda-c0e055c9f157.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126877,"FileName":"44b7aabe-8ec5-41bd-9f38-c776efb815c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130451,"Name":"The Magnetic Scrolls Collection","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"More than a compilation, this collection brings three Magnetic Scrolls' hits, now enhanced to run under Wonderland's Magnetic Windows game environment: Fish! - The Seven Deadly Fins, an inter-dimensional group of anarchists, are on the loose.

The game features windows with adjustable size, separating graphical display from inventory, command interface, text descriptions, and other options.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"magnetic Scrolls","Publisher":"Virgin Mastertronic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130501,"FileName":"69ae7956-ac95-4888-8192-0b9085e22818.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130501,"FileName":"4e5ff2f9-6292-4692-8e94-b7859a313532.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130501,"FileName":"4ad8f61a-7611-4358-ad01-4fe8c270283e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130502,"Name":"Word up Word Down    ","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A word puzzle game which was notable for containing a hidden game, Save the Plebs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Gem Electronics","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130502,"FileName":"201a827b-1068-4a2b-a947-e21ef4d544f1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130502,"FileName":"3b9f5e67-0d31-4cec-ab6f-3b30546a0a1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177427,"Name":"World Championship Boxing Manager","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office. Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations. Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules. A fight in one set of rules won't be viewed quite as significantly by the other. The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the two expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges’ decision would go). Before and during the fights the player can instruct the boxer as to what tactics to adopt.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjxovOBtOy8","Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Fighting; Sports","Developer":"Goliath Games","Publisher":"Krisalis Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177427,"FileName":"56449b47-a5ca-447b-9030-34feb74cb63e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":177427,"FileName":"ff7908e8-b392-4138-9b9c-407fade0caf4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":177427,"FileName":"3e78bdf4-bdb9-4ada-b99a-ff7197d84c50.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177427,"FileName":"f21c3182-1d4b-4f35-9bec-6a1c7d4a1c17.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177427,"FileName":"8d061451-82f7-499c-be05-b7bd81b89d3c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130503,"Name":"WorldScape  ","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A Sim City type game with an ecological theme.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Eclipse","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130503,"FileName":"1be2c12f-f95a-4206-9b10-e225143f9290.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130503,"FileName":"1807b80a-3bc9-4579-a7a1-dd76167517d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130504,"Name":"Worra Battle","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"A 3D style war game involving tanks.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Oak Solutions","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130504,"FileName":"797a2128-1029-4fcf-ba87-d9467260c0fd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130504,"FileName":"6de3c338-0ae7-469f-b0df-1f124b8c55bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124949,"Name":"Xenon 2: Megablast","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature.

The seeder vessels are slow-moving, predictable, and easily destroyed, but as the game progresses they are supported by increasing numbers of flying support craft, which do not scatter virus but instead attack the player.\n\nThe seeder vessels scatter red virus particles across the landscape. As they land, they turn the green landscape to brown and red, and cause the trees to mutate. Some flying enemies shoot the mutated trees, to cause themselves to become much more aggressive and dangerous. To clear each attack wave, the player must destroy all enemy vessels.\n\nAt the conclusion of each attack wave the player is awarded bonus points for the amount of landscape which remains uninfected. After four attack waves have been successfully repelled, the player is awarded a new landscape; however, there is comparatively less land and more water, making complete infection more likely.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXypBxNGMo","Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator; Shooter","Developer":"David Braben","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32456,"FileName":"a210af2a-6982-4333-a037-505928c1d4f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":32456,"FileName":"a172ffc3-c72b-46e5-82fb-8e50e25d157e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32456,"FileName":"a76da4cc-d6de-4d50-984c-f8c9daa23284.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32456,"FileName":"33a76bdf-f6db-4c61-abe5-9815f141f00b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32456,"FileName":"adc9a3ed-f306-42e3-a40a-1edbc02821e5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130507,"Name":"Zelanites: The Onslaught","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A Space Invaders come Galaga style game in which you must defeat the Zelanite armada.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Micro Power","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130507,"FileName":"1f1cb9c7-e80a-4cb5-969b-5c477f4f0012.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130507,"FileName":"2d31252f-3217-41bc-a467-fbfb30161850.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130507,"FileName":"ac5e7722-e7ea-4021-b3fb-881a5d2a5f8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130507,"FileName":"d5f99cbf-5087-40a9-a2e5-b0ba96f8abee.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130507,"FileName":"b83edf33-84cc-4926-85c9-7d8ab1e528e9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130508,"Name":"Zodiac Aries","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Archimedes","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130508,"FileName":"1ac8b764-eb68-4f91-849e-b426d394f63d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":130508,"FileName":"6c573680-c520-4267-a734-925f823875b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":130509,"Name":"Zool: Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.\n\nHis name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension.

These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool.
