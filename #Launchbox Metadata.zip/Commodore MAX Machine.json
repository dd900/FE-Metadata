To reach the balloons at the top of the screen you have to move a seesaw under a jumping clown. This will launch away the clown already standing on the seesaw, hopefully towards the balloons. Balloons comes in three different: yellow, green and blue. Yellow balloons are the easiest to reach, while the blue are the hardest. Therefore you also get more points for the harder to reach balloons. If you manage to clear all balloons of a color, you'll get bonus points. Balloons of that color will then be replenished. You have five jumpers to your disposal, and you will lose one every time you miss to catch the landing clown. Clearing all blue balloons will give you an extra jumper.

The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.\n\n    The second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.\n\n\n    The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.\n\n\n    The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.\n\n\n    The fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.\n\n\nFinishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"149795":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d9b73822-f912-447f-82ea-42a64d79c84b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8cf45c3a-a200-4103-83c6-4a5d5e6b95e9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3775c90e-1714-4277-8270-e2cf0752a839.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"945be643-69a0-4e63-974b-09e3e8ca6c60.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"812d1b85-ffb7-4ffc-a104-91edd2232d63.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"78304042-d503-4e83-913b-7ac48a8869d4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"2e3e9d51-ea5c-45c0-8c05-6394d0cc6991.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f4a258c4-0dd1-4cac-b76a-c3fb6b0ccd15.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1cda5c4f-b45d-4e5f-8fa3-68f61cdcbe02.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0a20da54-f444-4ec0-bed7-5a656a0e8fcf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jupiter Lander","Overview":"You have to try to slowly land a spaceship on Jupiter.

From the top deadly arrows are shot towards him and these he has to dodge or he will lose a life. To his help he has three brick barricades that he can hide behind. He can't hide too long though as the barricades take damage from the arrows and will after a while be gone. The player can use two special functions. One that increases speed and one that creates a force field that destroys arrows. These cost energy and the player is awarded bonus points for the amount of energy he has left.

The hostile spaceships can shoot back, hostile shots and obstacles as well as collisions with the enemies destroy your ship. The game is over when all three own ships are destroyed. In contrast to Asteroids, there are protective shields at the border of the screen, where the ship will bounce off. So you cannot fly further than the border of the screen. In the middle of the screen there is a rectangular protective zone, where the high score and the ships that are left are displayed.","Publisher":"Commodore","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"149818":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"96f171fe-4582-4c1e-94f1-0950129b990f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"415b288c-5a94-4211-840b-a710f9411ed9.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"72b1de1d-4765-4ac6-8fec-e6d0f10e2621.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"0d7e0749-c6df-42b6-ad58-0b50affd9ca0.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"216b1bb3-d902-4d6e-a440-187464a1d65d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"57ea12ae-215e-43b7-abf3-233ac18bf667.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ebcc156b-e026-46ab-bb75-e0acbc108d6a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c86d45c7-669c-4c5a-97f9-ccb5cb842227.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pinball Spectacular","Overview":"\"Pinball Spectacular\" is one of the first flipper simulations for the Commodore home computers. The game was delivered on cartridge. A speciality is the controls by paddle.\n\nThe flipper simulation is a mixture of pinball and breakout. The square-cut ball is rolled over the pinball table with the help of a double board similar to Breakout. As pinball elements, there are -next to walls- also two bumpers (upper right and left), the Commodore logo (in the middle of the screen), the light C O M M O D O R E with the corresponding targets, two spinners, four sideways ball traps (middle and bottom) and a point display. Furthermore, there is a time-sensitive ball barrier to avoid the ball going into out. The overview line with ball display, active player and points is in the first line of the screen. You have 3 balls per game.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"149820":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7edec83e-3bf6-4780-922f-0748676f238b.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3c8ebbff-0488-4c10-bf78-c0102317d929.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b8175d9e-a5ca-4a93-955c-f9874eef092a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"af66dc43-f3c2-43e5-967f-c25b1debfa15.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"027f8777-39a9-42b8-b0b0-e25f50aadef6.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7a3a60f2-6e2d-498a-af33-0c9b645f4cad.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"94def168-f702-4b61-8b53-69edaa317e29.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"321cf5b7-1ace-4dca-b08c-2c1e9249412c.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Radar Rat Race","Overview":"In Radar Rat Race the player plays the role of a blue mouse, that has to search for cheese in a labyrinth within a certain time. To make it a bit harder, you are followed by several red mice which bring you certain death when you crash into one of them. As the red mice outnumber you, you should take into account that you might get encircled by several mice. A further peril are the black cats, which lure behind some of the corners. Into those also the red mice can run, but they are only delayed by the cat and not killed. With a \"Star Screen\" - a trace of stars that can be left behind by the blue mouse - you can temporarily disable followers which are too close.\n\nWhen you have collected all the cheese in the labyrinth, you reach the next round. With every round the number of cheese slices and the enemy mice is raised.\n\nFor a better orientation in the labyrinth there is a \"radar overview\" in the window on the right:\n\n    Turquoise square: player\n    White square: cheese slices\n    Purple crosses: red enemy mice\n\nUnfortunately, the black cats are not shown on the radar.","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"149822":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"8369b863-c734-4bbe-9bc6-816d0a2e2f66.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box -
