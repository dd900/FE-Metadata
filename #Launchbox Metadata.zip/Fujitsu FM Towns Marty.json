{"Name":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","Games":[{"DatabaseID":185133,"Name":"38 Man Kilo No Kokuu","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Following a devastating atomic war between USA and Soviet Union, the Earth has plunged into chaos and destruction in the 1990-ies. It was not until the middle of the 21th century that humanity started to recover from its losses. Earth was nearly abandoned, and representative of the most powerful countries concentrated on space colonization projects. The Americans founded an organization called NSCA (National Space Colonized Association). Their project, SC (Space Colony), was a huge tower, comparable to the mythical Tower of Babel. This is also the home of the game's protagonist, who returns after prolonged space travels, and soon becomes involved in a complex struggle between countries and political organizations.\n\nThe fifth installment of System Sacom's Novel Ware series, 38000 Kilo no Kokū is essentially a visual novel. The majority of the game consists of text - dialogues, descriptions of the hero's thoughts and actions, and an extensive database concerning the scientific/political background of the game. Though graphical images (usually of people) are displayed by default in small windows, they can be turned off. The player follows the story, sometimes altering its course by selecting an action/response when such a choice is given to him by the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"System Sacom","Publisher":"System Sacom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"ebc15cc7-9a47-4561-9030-2640fedf1950.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"89792b26-111e-4214-acef-b4ee43008755.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"7edd3d88-9c3d-4ecf-8436-946a53240b66.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"af4a3536-b24e-4761-878d-7648b67b7c7f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"847f55d5-b4d0-4875-ab01-aa55dfc281b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"94a1376d-18eb-42db-8025-e47059b7e7c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"1c4da994-ba19-4b6e-801d-d4cddddc1c65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185133,"FileName":"3cfce2fa-74d5-4f47-8f31-ba9a7c5d15cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185133,"AlternateName":"38000 Kilo no Kokū","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185133,"AlternateName":"A Day in the Life of 2049: File 1: 38-man Kilo no Kokuu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183926,"Name":"3x3 Eyes: Sanjiyan Henjyo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sanjiyan Henjō is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes.

It was originally developed and published by Japanese game developer Artdink for Japan, and was later published by Maxis for the United States. It was originally released in December 1990 for the NEC PC-9801, FM Towns Marty, Sharp X68000, and PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16).[3] The US version was released in October 1992 on DOS and Amiga.[4] Later, the Japanese version was re-released in March 2000 for Windows 95 and 98. Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.\n\nThe game puts players in command of a railway company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of near-isometric dimetric projection to present the city, similar to Maxis's later SimCity 2000.[5] There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right, and if these areas are populated enough.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Artdink Corporation","Publisher":"Artdink Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187744,"FileName":"4ef0e0a9-0bf7-42f9-a574-d57d09741c1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187744,"FileName":"b824d131-1581-47b4-862a-eda649e670c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187744,"FileName":"9b1da91d-00d0-4323-ac32-457326934828.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187744,"FileName":"6ba5bf4d-1b0b-4764-9a0c-fd8c64e863e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187744,"AlternateName":"A.III.: A Ressha de Ikou III","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188300,"Name":"A Ressha de Ikou IV","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"ArtDink","Publisher":"ArtDink","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188300,"FileName":"618a66b3-e90d-45a4-bfea-03e58864ceab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188300,"FileName":"fc3b9d42-d3a9-4bc6-9538-4d0bd8754b6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188300,"FileName":"a163b406-4776-4d7d-b1c3-0e59e1efa5ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188300,"AlternateName":"AIV: A Ressha de Ikou 4","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":177879,"Name":"Abel: Shin Mokushiroku Taisen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the beginning of the 21st century, the Earth has reached an unseen level of technological progress.

Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.\n\nCarnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch.

Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.\n\nA young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"c67864b2-e3ea-42a4-824f-b636ddd97fdc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"8cb93ae1-a9e3-460a-8237-4b7f16d1b0d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"4d86dc6c-93c5-473f-9cdd-2217a2fdb23a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"3038b166-5209-4c76-a474-e642ed6655c1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"eb2a9ef7-acfa-4b44-a87c-fc6251cdb9ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"6b1d1052-60d9-4a00-8fb0-bac824e9ad22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124834,"FileName":"ff73bf98-944c-4cb7-a6f3-e439f1000026.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184100,"Name":"Amaranth III","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Amaranth III directly continues the story of the second game.

It has a more modern setting, with steam-punk elements. The gameplay system has been re-vamped, becoming closer to a strategy RPG than to an action RPG. As before, the battles feature free movement, but it is turn-based now, with action points for each characters; the character can act as long as he/she still have action points left. There is a \"Vigour\" system that keeps track of characters' stamina; once the vigour is lowered, the character begins to lose hit points. Using special items and resting in inns restores vigour.\n\nThe game also makes a step towards strategy RPGs by focusing less on exploration and more on pre-set, story-dictated battles.

The game is set in a fictional medieval fantasy world and its story takes place on the continent of Aglia. Many primary and secondary characters are featured and eventually become controllable by the player, but the initial segment of the story begins in the small southern kingdom of Finice-Deal, focusing on a young knight who has completed his nobility initiation and must protect his country from hostile pagan worshipers.\n\nThe game is divided into scenarios, each built like a large-scale tactical battle that takes place in a location comprising outdoor areas and towns. The player navigates characters in real time on the overhead battle field in a point-and-click fashion, with enemies moving in real time as well. Each character represents a unit of a different type (such as knights, archers, magicians, etc., some with a general leading them). When a player-controlled and an AI-controlled unit are near each other the player can opt to view a full-screen animated battle sequence, the outcome of which is decided depending on the combatant's parameters. Like in regular RPGs, towns can be visited and establishments such as inns, shops and bars can be accessed (however, without free movement through the rest of the town). This can be done in the middle of the battle, provided a character is positioned near a town gate. Characters gain experience points, level up, and can equip a variety of weapons, armor and accessories.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190750,"FileName":"f8c07c3e-2198-49af-a6ca-12c9b946167a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190750,"FileName":"50388b83-a211-4660-a96f-f7daeb66ae9e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190750,"FileName":"309bd08b-14da-4172-b15f-de4d48d3f76a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185170,"Name":"Bible Master: Crash of the BlleotRutz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bible Master is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Glodia, which was released in Japan in 1993","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"bf0a833b-86dc-424c-b908-8dc366b75966.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"cbdbaac8-7a5a-4cd8-960c-bd7f429a615f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"53a3138b-06a0-4644-a07a-fa7e928d2181.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"e6f9adb0-4459-47d7-ad26-fd9822ca316f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"64f4bc63-24d0-4f8a-94ee-898b09d576f8.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"26a6f031-714a-4891-bc05-af0991ac1150.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185170,"FileName":"30a9530a-1e7c-4759-8517-6c099802578c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185170,"AlternateName":"Bible Master","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188770,"Name":"Big Honour","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"ArtDink","Publisher":"ArtDink","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188770,"FileName":"69e93f69-4b8b-4e6c-82ea-11099c8cf199.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186730,"Name":"Blandia Plus","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Blandia is a versus fighting game that takes place on the Great Continent of Eurasia and focuses on the resurrection of the demonic lord Gildus, who must be stopped by one of the six greatest warriors in the land, led by the noble Gurianos.

There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously).

You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map.\n\nOne part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship.\n\nAnother part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province.\n\nWhen you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight.\n\nWhen your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat.\n\nFinally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Bits of Magic","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188068,"FileName":"634e3568-71dd-45ca-9adb-cb7bff3b3e5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188068,"FileName":"e04a7852-5b40-4eb3-848e-941ba5e5179e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188068,"FileName":"c417497f-6f62-4a45-963d-f6c050de6dd9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188068,"FileName":"4c16107a-f81d-4bca-ac41-f3dbae1199a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188068,"FileName":"b5a9bccb-090a-40ec-b049-d100f9ca25fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192869,"Name":"CG Syndicate vol. 1: Lisa Northpoint","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"R-Key","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":192869,"FileName":"3bf1657c-8bbc-4808-8cc4-29092d79e26c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":144465,"Name":"Chase H.Q.","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Chase H.Q.

To make matters worse the Cyberian scientist's genetically engineered creations are running rampant in the same area as the weapon and Devlin also appears to be have something up his sleeve.\n\nCyberia is an action game with puzzle sequences and a heavy reliance on scripted events and cutscenes.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:\nJoão Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Daikoukai Jidai game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\n\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. He yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great privateer in the name of king and country.\nRegardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: the Inn, the Item Shop, the Shipyard, the Tavern, the Castle, the Guild Hall, the Church, the Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"37a5c63f-7080-44a8-afcf-81eae3ab105d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"0dca47a1-66f2-438c-839a-20428e34da5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"0045db48-55b1-452f-bd4a-652fed2425d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"6774f954-3470-4be4-9521-395a64aaae68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"5a94cb80-690d-4e21-b2b9-4a36e24e09a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"b1344e36-1276-429a-8359-e192936d9b2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188167,"FileName":"e15a2d6c-4543-49f6-b784-2a71b2527a8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188074,"Name":"Daisenryaku III '90","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Daisenryaku III '90 is an enhanced version of Daisenryaku III: Great Commander featuring significantly improved operation speed and a better interface.\n\nDaisenryaku III: Great Commander is a turn-based war strategy game.

Three great tribes lived in peace with each other. Up in the sky, the Heavenly Tribe; down on the Earth, the Human Tribe; and between them, the Demon Tribe. But among the demons, there were some who wanted more power. The members of the Heavenly Tribe were forced to seal the rebellious demons in what they called \"Path of Light\". But one of them figured out how to break the seal. The demons were now free, and they attacked the Human Tribe. Horrible massacres, ruined cities and villages, exterminated nations - it looked like the End of Days had come to the humans...\n\n...A boy named Anduke was raised in a secluded location by two female elves. It was clear that the boy possessed extraordinary powers: at the tender age of nine, he was already able to sexually satisfy his lovely nannies. But a mysterious force tore the boy away, knocking him unconscious. He awoke ten years later, in a human village. A promise given to a young girl led him to a fateful meeting that revealed his destiny: he had the blood of Heavenly Tribe in him, and was the only one able to save the Human Tribe from the demons...\n\nDangel is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. Anduke meets companions on his quest, who join his party. The navigation is done from top-down perspective, while random turn-based battles use first-person view. Player-controlled characters can use regular attacks or magic. Anduke is also able to give commands to his elf companion, who has access to many magical spells. The game features full-screen anime-style cut-scenes to advance the story, many of which depict sexual encounters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Mink Co.

The game is played via a standard text interface where the player selects commands from a menu, interacting with other characters and places. The game consists of four chapters which make up the same storyline, but viewed by different characters. In each chapter the player will see the events and situations from different angles and uncover layers of the main plotline.\n\nThe computer versions of the game have scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations, which are not present in the console releases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"C's Ware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177171,"FileName":"5c3c2660-eb73-4678-9dc9-8d69be475c13.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177171,"FileName":"70d0776c-02c2-4248-ac58-4923c28fb58c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":177171,"AlternateName":"Desire: Haitoku no Rasen","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":201330,"Name":"Diamond Players","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Diamond Players is a Sports game, developed and published by Wolf Team, which was released in Japan in 1993.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201330,"FileName":"1d23bc2f-6c73-4084-b0a2-25d7bd509ac8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201330,"FileName":"f75dcd57-af58-499c-b957-47a239155c00.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188114,"Name":"Die Gekirin","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Years have passed since the brave young hero vanquished hordes of monsters and obtained the legendary sword.

The story focuses on the manga's protagonist, a cute half-human, half-dragon girl named Mink. She is in love with a pop singer and dragon-slayer Dick Saucer; however, to win his love, Mink has to find a magical potion to turn her into a human. In the game, Mink and her friend Lufa and Pia are having a vacation on the beach, listening to Dick Saucer's concert on the radio. When Dick mentions Mink in his \"special thanks\" speech, she decides to find him no matter what, even if it means changing her own nature.\n\nThis version of Dragon Half is an RPG with card-based system. The player navigates Mink, Lufa, and Pia through the top-down environments, encountering random enemies. During battles, the player selects cards for attack, healing, and other actions; there is no individual control of party members, and they also share an HP pool. The player can select several cards of the same type to increase the corresponding effect, or choose to save some of the cards for later to perform even more powerful combos.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"5909fe02-2062-41e1-9d41-56acebda7f47.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"80cb9a98-96af-4c5c-ada9-18bd7e37100f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"76bd26e6-b09f-4932-b5ba-9fdefbf110ac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"22603b04-c09f-48b2-bcef-335c901177b8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"f69542df-1aed-4a79-be5b-96c37337ecd7.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"dd156ea3-2839-4760-a942-8fdb61faa536.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"54e306e5-df45-4189-9df6-bc841e21a50a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184103,"FileName":"0c7f9bea-5cf0-40fc-b4f1-2327ca0a5cb7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188123,"Name":"Dragon Knight 4","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Knight 4 is a sequel to Knights of Xentar.

This fifteen-year-old boy has one weakness: he likes naked female elves. But soon he learns that the evil wizard Lushifon wants to turn all people into stones and control the whole world while nobody is able to stop him. Together with the mysterious swordsman Eto and many other heroes, Kakeru must perform his ultimate quest and defeat Lushifon and his minions.\n\nIn this tactical role-playing game the player controls nine units in battles, assigned according to the class of the character who leads the unit. The opponents also form similar groups, and are also divided into classes. Each class has its own range, strengths, and weaknesses. There are many characters the players can recruit to the party, and they belong to different classes (barbarians, archers, magicians, etc.).\n\nThe adult content (scenes which include nudity) has been removed from the console releases.

After liberating Strawberry Fields from an evil curse in his previous adventure, Desmond finds himself in a situation unworthy of his heroic status: robbers have taken all his possessions, including his magic sword, and even his clothes! So the first task for the unsuccessful hero will be to get some money. Luckily, the mayor has an assignment for the hero, for which he is also willing to pay. Desmond accepts the assignment without knowing what it will lead to - traveling all over the world, fighting fearsome enemies, encounter beautiful women, and solving a mystery that will also reveal the secret of his own true identity.\n\nThe game is a humorous RPG with erotic content. The gameplay is quite different from that of the previous game. The player travels in top-down view on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, like in most traditional Japanese RPGs. Enemy encounters are random. Battle system differs from most other games of its type by being real-time: combatants appear on a side-scrolling area and exchange attacks automatically; the player can interfere at any time and issue orders to the characters in the party - cast a spell, use an item, or change the attack power level. Physical attacks have a gauge with eight different power levels; the higher the level is, the stronger is the attack, and the slower is its speed.\n\nDragon Knight III features anime-style cutscenes, many of which contain erotic images - the girls Desmond encounters and helps will often feel grateful and award him with some \"treatment\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188125,"FileName":"e3dafb46-e17b-4d98-8413-55fb6c9e9712.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188125,"FileName":"84dcb840-8a93-4b39-8f98-679116831bdf.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188125,"FileName":"72b1c744-69e2-4a35-abb5-60f06a894028.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188125,"FileName":"7a641852-ef43-4f55-8949-051fc5c6eddc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188125,"FileName":"15d556fe-4e3b-4fa6-993d-fc44aab497d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188125,"FileName":"e1503774-d8ed-4d2d-8d77-3885f9fab996.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188777,"Name":"Dragon Shock","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/Xz9QISIwt78","Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"LOG","Publisher":"LOG","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188777,"FileName":"1ffc6a9c-0076-4f50-a1cb-6f78518e0cba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201961,"Name":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes tells the story of a young prince named Selios.

The young prince manages to escape, but without the possibility to return he has no choice but to wander through the land, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him to save his country.\n\nThis is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective (like in Dragon Warrior games).

Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?\n\nThe second Dragon Slayer is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.

Chance encounters with hostile monsters are regular, but in contrast to other RPGs, the player may be attacked while stationary. All battles are automated by default but allow the player to micromanage their four combatants. The player is given time to focus on the real-time tactics of each enemy encounter, such as activating defense magic, moving around, or switching weapons on the fly. The player's party may also be accosted at night when viewing constellations in the sky, or any time after bumping into a half-buried urn.\n\nThe player may attempt to flee from attackers or retaliate against foes who, when defeated, grants all party members experience points that go towards leveling up and improving character stats. Each of the characters in the player's party have health points, magic points for spellcasting, power, defense, physique, fortune, intelligence, knowledge, and agility; each stat has a direct effect on how a character plays. Character stats are assigned by the player at the start of the game using a cap-and-trade system. Each party member fills one of the four roles: scout, wizard, fighter, and priest, each with different strengths and abilities.  Items can be purchased from traveling merchants who ambush the party, or at the tavern. Items are categorized as armor, weapons, healing items, rings, and misc. (such as torches).\n\nPast castles can be revisited at any time, which themselves act like Temples found in Legend of Zelda games. Castles are self-contained levels with obstacles, loot, enemies, and maze-like architecture; and they each must be visited at least once.\n\nDrakkhen's gameplay is colored by its early-game brutality and surreal enemy encounters, the former especially in the SNES version. One special enemy is relegated solely to appearing when the player kicks one of the many urns in the ground. Upon doing so, a black, stationary canine head rises from beneath the floor to shoot bolts from its eyes. These encounters are quickly fatal to new players who don't know any better.  They offer no experience points, suggesting that kicking an urn is frowned upon. Another difficult enemy is the \"Shadow Man\", a tall figure that can unexpectedly lift itself out of the ground, accompanied by an ominous tune. Each enemy has movement and attack differences, some being less subtle than others, such as enemies that zigzag sporadically at a much greater speed than the player's party can keep up with. The game contains over one hundred different enemy variants.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Pep1toCCM&ab_channel=FunCade64","Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Infogrames","Publisher":"Fujitsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"74777703-8248-483c-a69b-2d5870343729.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"3fd036a8-7cbe-4eaf-8cab-3152692a62d2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"aaf449f8-1830-41d1-9a06-482c55c3ec12.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"2fb0111a-53eb-4be2-ab4c-2c54a317609d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"4e003abc-175c-49b5-966a-97b52ff6ccdb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"5a0f8246-37e0-4817-9f7c-808898ca6478.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"609cd95c-5312-468e-8a7d-eb18a49349a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"edbe69c5-a563-4a36-995e-e0d56316bd22.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146765,"FileName":"84d4c8bd-c0c1-413b-adbb-93ff6c7b33cf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146766,"Name":"Dungeon Master","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon.

Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"FTL Games","Publisher":"Fujitsu Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"21d48cce-30dc-4af9-b637-2a0acf75e1cf.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"afc78e70-53d6-4c1c-8b03-92aa0674cb90.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"2031eb05-7629-4aac-94c7-46ecf7eaa264.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"33832433-6ff0-4552-a057-7ac6b65e0c48.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"554ffda2-1500-453a-ab13-51b01243bb9a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"13097f0d-407e-47ec-a4e8-2fc8757f43b0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"fce303c0-c83e-4250-83c9-c7672963fffa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146766,"FileName":"6a27c531-77e1-445c-b9ad-cf0271a89c95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145237,"Name":"Dungeon Master II: Skullkeep","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Chaos Strikes Back was a semi-sequel to seminal RPG Dungeon Master, but a true sequel came several years later.

He discovers that he might be in possession of magical abilities (which would make him an Irregular), and escapes to the desert, where he meets a girl named Selena, who directs him to the base of a rebel organization. Joining the rebels, Rick must face his Imperial superiors, some of which are closely related to him...\n\nElm Knight is an action game that mostly focuses on giant robot (\"mech\") combat. The game is set in pseudo-3D maze-like environments (with an auto-map) and is viewed from first-person perspective. Enemies (such as enemy robots) walk around in hostile areas. The playable robot, controlled by Rick, is equipped with projectile weapons of different kinds, with limited ammo. It is also possible to use melee attacks to defeat the opponents. In some areas, Rick is controlled directly (though the view and the interface are the same), and is able to use weapons such as a handgun to defend himself.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/VSYizQZu7OY","Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"4212db91-79c6-4f7b-8528-c3ccc2b20183.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"d2584bb6-2e09-41aa-a7f6-9f20bc85d125.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"770d4db3-0981-4463-bdba-16ac04882526.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"fbb87fd7-3354-4d7d-a0f1-2f0ccde966be.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"4b0e66e3-5872-4441-b508-30a03216eb72.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"4d8d9ec9-eec2-4cae-baf3-3683db25f6c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184138,"FileName":"8d7c2d3c-152b-4667-87cf-59395ddc2a2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184138,"AlternateName":"A Living Body Armor: Elm Knight","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":184691,"Name":"Emerald Dragon","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...\n\nThe game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184691,"FileName":"b49869c0-1604-4f3e-9644-61136f4af5a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184691,"FileName":"1df7fe6f-7b1e-428b-aa3d-e9a57f9c605c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184691,"FileName":"e2c22808-38bd-427d-8a91-e1a02bb1d1e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184691,"FileName":"fe33c6c2-4ceb-4d69-8bf5-13feed5bb4e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184691,"FileName":"095fa55e-2076-44c0-8caf-2768161a776c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184691,"FileName":"c848e7e6-9e3b-4ff7-8507-8d2fd6c4eba2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188127,"Name":"EMIT Vol. 1: Toki no Maigo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Emit is a visual novel divided into 3 parts which was made to help Japanese people study English.

All that remained was her book of curses, for which nobody found any use. Peace descended upon the humans. But the young princess Ashura Kei showed Guendola's book to the angel Dominion; after having read the book, Dominion realized that she could attain the power of Guendola, betrayed the humans, and placed a rather embarrassing curse on Ashura's general, Leon: he was endowed with a pair of breasts... But with such \"disguise\", Leon found it easier to \"train\" the best female fighters in the country and assemble an army that would defeat evil once again.\n\nHikari o Ninau Mono plays similarly to its predecessor; it is a rather simple turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid. As in the first game, the player commands a squad of pretty girls, each with her own movement and attack range. Battle sequences are now fully animated, showing unique attack moves for all characters. There is still no exploration outside of battles, but the player has more options beside equipping his fighters: as Leon, it is possible to spend an evening with a girl of the player's choice in different locations, which might lead to further erotic scenes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Ponytail Soft","Publisher":"Ponytail Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":198888,"FileName":"203ed8ef-cbbb-4775-a8fe-29f345774e4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":198888,"FileName":"7227a9e7-dcd8-4cce-8cb4-8bc33017a4f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":198888,"FileName":"8b4fa5d5-d9bb-46d9-9aa7-867f91af886a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":198888,"FileName":"f77bade9-473b-4144-a66c-28f4cef25255.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":198888,"AlternateName":"Engage Errands II: Kouki o Ninau Mono","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":198886,"Name":"Engage Errands: Miwaku no Shitotachi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Engage Errands, the player commands a unit of angelic fighters.

The player takes control of Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.\n\nFlashback incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a \"cinematic platformer\" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.\n\nWhile a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.\n\nTo defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and complete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Delphine Software International","Publisher":"Victor Entertainment Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184139,"FileName":"510e3ce4-2930-426c-8d5a-421024df1708.jpg","Type":"Box -

One day, bad news reach the tower: the hero's father, the great knight Allen, is missing. Receiving the blessings of the wise teacher, the hero immediately begins the long journey, hoping to find companions who would help him on his quest to find the missing knight.\n\nFree Will: Knight of Argent contains elements of a traditional Japanese-style RPG, such as top-down world map navigation, random battles, simple character growth (automatic level up), etc. However, it has several features rarely found in games belonging to this genre. Each dialogue with an NPC brings a menu with four options: Information, Companion, Justice, and Negotiate. \"Information\" corresponds to standard NPC conversation; \"Negotiate\" is mostly used in shops to buy items, but can also be used in specific situations to trigger events. The two other commands are the more interesting ones. It is possible to convince an NPC to join the party; this doesn't rely on story events, and since there are many characters who would join, it is possible to build completely different and quite large parties. The \"Justice\" commands is basically attacking an NPC on the spot. It is possible to attack anyone, even key plot characters - although in most cases, naturally, the battle will be over very quickly, and the hero would be \"welcome to heaven\", as the game itself calls it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Kinpukurin","Publisher":"Kinpukurin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188138,"FileName":"86e3387f-0894-49ba-aa5c-e03feb313f96.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188138,"FileName":"9a93adf0-fc41-42ea-a2e3-585e15778ca9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188138,"FileName":"cf918072-f751-4c98-89db-580bc3f5c527.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188138,"FileName":"6ce2f24d-313c-4403-bc7f-9d3eea67c0e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188138,"FileName":"16e495ab-a8d7-4269-bc97-bf075750a25f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187735,"Name":"Fujitsu Air Warrior V1.1","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Kesmai Corporation","Publisher":"Fujitsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187735,"FileName":"2c4b5038-2954-4642-be56-f7d17a5cc15a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187735,"FileName":"190631bc-e74b-4fd8-aeec-25427b45b1e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187735,"AlternateName":"Fujitsu Air Warrior V2: Version 2.1 Level 10","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187735,"AlternateName":"Fujitsu Air Warrior V1.2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188369,"Name":"Fujitsu Habitat","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Habitat is a MMO (massive multiplayer online game), originally designed by Chip Morningstar and Noah Falstein at Lucasfilm Games. Although it is not the first online game, it lay the groundwork for modern MMORPGs by allowing more than 20,000 gamers to play in the same open-ended, virtual world, even though it doesn't contain typical RPG characteristics such as levelling, skills, abilities and classes. Still, Habitat forms the link between text-based MUDs that rarely topped the 100-player mark and modern MMORPGs. Because of the limited trial phase it was released in, it never contained more than 500 players.\n\nThe game was originally released as a beta test and could only be played through Quantum Link, an online service of Quantum Computer Services (which later became America OnLine), and was only available in the evenings and weekends, as network traffic was cheaper at those moments. You control an avatar, seen from a third-person perspective in a 2D world. Avatars can gesture, move around, communicate with other characters, and manipulate objects. The world consists of thousands of regions - different environments that can be accessed through doors, teleportation and other entrances. You can also communicate through the in-game mail system or by using ESP (telepathic abilities), and personalise your avatar with the skin tone, features, or clothing.\n\nPlayers can visit stores, houses, pubs, forests... and use objects such as tools, weapons and magical items. The stress is on the social dimension. You can get married, play games, write a book, go adventuring, visit theatres or lectures, or start a company, a guild, or a religion. Each player has a bank account and there is an in-game economy based on tokens. The game designers even appeared in the game as powerful opponents and global quests were organised. These are presented as one-time challenges, and not as instances multiple players can encounter at different moments. Players can also turn into ghosts to discover new areas without risks. Although there are no real classes, people can behave as thieves, law enforcers or clergymen. There are no regulations and players are only limited to what the game code allows. Quests are provided by the Oracle, an almighty entity that 'created' the Habitat. The libertarian approach with the freedom in gameplay was introduced because people solved quests too quickly and the developers would never be able to keep up with new content.\n\nNew features were added gradually. Rather than controlling or limiting the possibilities, the developers observed gamers' behaviour and introduced novelties according to the needs. It also includes PvP fighting (player vs. player) and safe zones in the cities. Habitat has its own newspaper, The Rant, documenting events and reserved for announcements.\n\nThe project was ended in 1988 when Quantum Link observed that the 500 players played the game so much that the game's traffic ate up 1% of the total capacity of the entire QL service. The company feared it would not be able to sustain the network with a full release open to many more players, and scrapped the project. It resurfaced later in 1988 as Club Caribe, and as Fujitsu Habitat in 1990 when the technology was licensed to Fujitsu. Eventually, Fujitsu bought it entirely and launched it as WorldsAway in 1995. The game currently lives on as Vzones and the fantasy variant Second Kingdom. Right now, the unrelated Second Life incorporates most of Habitat's mechanics.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" MMO; Role-Playing","Developer":"Fujitsu","Publisher":"Fujitsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"2d28f095-db82-44e3-8abe-610a5743cf43.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"fda2c9da-f037-4f2e-ac06-4bcd1533970b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"4adf5b4c-8b7e-45f4-8c41-670a3c64fd31.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"aed5cef0-f467-4ac5-a0ce-0d1252b2b43f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"c82b54c2-5b26-4427-a53d-9bc247c87809.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"9c698cdf-1ae9-465c-8d3e-a20a14b79129.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"31a82be7-f163-4ace-9284-bb23fa0a9a23.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188369,"FileName":"9def42b2-8207-4b93-99ad-30f60e1b508a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188369,"AlternateName":"Fujitsu Habitat V2.1 L10","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":182658,"Name":"Fushigi no Umi no Nadia: The Secret of the Blue Water","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"One of the games based on the Japanese animated series Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, which is loosely based on works by the famous French writer Jules Verne, in particular Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.\n\nThe story focuses on a fourteen-year-old French boy named Jean, who is a talented inventor and an avid adventurer. Together with Nadia, a runaway circus girl of mysterious African origins, they travel all around the world in an attempt to reveal the secret of Nadia's pendant, pursued by the race of Neo-Atlanteans and their ruthless leader Gargoyle.\n\nThe game's narrative is parallel to later episodes of the show, when the two young heroes have already joined forces with the mysterious Captain Nemo and travel on board the wondrous submarine \"Nautilus\" to the island Fiji, hoping to find the traces of a lost ship on which Jean's father was last sighted.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is a Japanese-style adventure with the typical first-person view, still screens, and menu commands Look, Talk, Think, and Move. As it often happens in games of this genre, the player is usually required to go through the commands several times until the next event is \"triggered\". There are also a few ship battles which require the player to choose actions and weapons for \"Nautilus\"; however, they are also done in adventure fashion and are heavily scripted to be considered an additional strategy-based gameplay element.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/SbNdN9F1TTI","Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182658,"FileName":"6652300d-14ed-4482-ad69-eec4a0fbd72d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182658,"FileName":"7160e704-872a-427b-9699-d0ecb9df1c81.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182658,"FileName":"59897689-72aa-4ea1-a0e0-cc81dad66342.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182658,"FileName":"5aa37ebd-b7b2-4ec5-9afb-8385d8d6fe76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182658,"FileName":"ef34c4ff-e948-4d77-82cb-40c92526fe38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182658,"FileName":"a83b8ba0-736a-40bf-aa37-bd37e9fb1e44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182658,"AlternateName":"The Secret of the Blue Water","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182658,"AlternateName":"Fushigi no Umi no Nadia","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188140,"Name":"Gadget: Invention, Travel & Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Gadget puts you in a strange surreal world were a comet appears to be heading for the earth.

But years have passed, and the youngsters rebelled against the oligarchs. Chaos reigned on the island, and even terrorist attacks were not uncommon. Amatsukami Hidehiko, the last (and youngest) of the oligarchs, decides to change the way of things. Using his charisma, but also more violent tactics, he goes to the troubled school to deal personally with anyone who dares oppose him.\n\nGakuen King is a peculiar mixture of typical Japanese RPG with random turn-based battles, strategy elements (recruiting students to join Hidehiko's army), and adventure elements (\"search\" command, finding and manipulating items), with extended sex scenes that have Japanese adventure-style menu-based interaction. The basic gameplay is that of a top-down RPG: Hidehiko walks around, fights random enemies, levels up, etc. The combat system is rather basic: Hidehiko's party (or, better to say, army) is treated like a single character - the player is only able to give general commands (attack, use special powers, retreat, etc.), after which the battle unfolds automatically. That is why the player also has to focus on adventure-like exploration to solve problems and overcome obstacles, as well as constantly enlarging the army to become stronger.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Alice Soft","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188141,"FileName":"ce77db58-f3e5-410a-a0e2-3cb9ce129c5a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188141,"FileName":"a76e0e72-64b8-46be-b696-247689822f2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188141,"FileName":"18a03daa-a8d2-46ff-afdf-368754382eed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188141,"FileName":"0fbe62bf-b1df-4447-a23b-38255eacb709.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188141,"FileName":"c7a55f96-bcea-4289-93b4-4bc259d5f20e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188141,"FileName":"110dc4c2-0fad-4f26-8e3a-d7f1a74d696b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164122,"Name":"Galaxy Force II","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"BGM became CD-DA, and prologue story was arranged greatly including the insertion of the visual demo with narration of Tsubakino .

There are five possible scenarios in the game. Unlike the first game, there is an option to choose which space fleet to control (Imperial or Alliance) for each scenario. The player takes control of planets allied with the chosen state. It is possible to deploy an entire fleet of a planet into the battle, or have it supply separate units. The players navigates the units (space ships of different kinds) on the top-down map in turn-based fashion, attacking or defending against enemy ships.

Mark, Jewel, and their friends have to find a way to defeat the Rosenkreuz and their leader, the ambitious Irene, who won't stop until the entire world is under her control...\n\nGunBlaze plays like a story-driven Japanese RPG, with the real-world setting adding some unusual gameplay elements. Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.\n\nOtherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.\n\nDespite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design.

Evil bunnies are disturbing the peace in the country side, and the hero, aided by the lovely girl Nina, has to get rid of them and bring back the carrots. This is an action game, with bunnies popping out of holes in different stages, and the player character hitting them on the heads using various items (such as a house shoe).\n\nThe shortest game tells the story of Titis, a lovely mermaid who dreams of marrying a human prince. In search for the love of her life, Titis gets to know the world of humans through a series of sexual encounters. This game is once again a typical Japanese adventure with menu-based commands and no movement of any kind (the player switches locations automatically, as dictated by the story).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":200749,"FileName":"f448e275-aaa2-4dda-bc4a-32316c161d24.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":200749,"AlternateName":"Half Moon ni Kawaru made: Ramiyaryou no Nijiiro Tamatebako","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188169,"Name":"Hana no Kioku","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hana no Kioku consists of five episodes, all of which can be accessed from the main menu, in no particular order:\nThe young school girl Chiko is taking a subway train and is sexually molested by what she thinks is a chihan (a person with the popular Japanese \"hobby\" of touching young girls on the trains). However, the chihan turns out to be a young girl named Kiko, who wears a rather elaborate disguise.\n\nAn episode dedicated to another popular Japanese theme: tentacle sex. A young girl named Mei thinks about anime stories and brave heroes who defeat monsters; at that moment, she is sexually assaulted by a horribly-looking giant squid monster.\n\nMei is back in school, but this time she is not the player-controlled character; the latter is now a female teacher named Sumi, who has ordered Mei to stay in the classroom after the lesson, in order to have sex with her.\n\nA school girl named Saki is sick and is lying on the bed in the school hospital.

But there, he meets Millray, a young girl with magic powers, who was wrongly imprisoned. Changing his plans, Marcfeand helps the girl to escape from her cell - but the guards are alarmed, and soon the two unlikely heroes have to fight for their lives. Shortly thereafter the two young people discover that they can re-animate and command monsters - which is the same curse the old king Richard MacIntyre was afflicted with...\n\nLike its predecessor, Hiōden 2 is a mixture of RPG and real-time strategy. The player commands one or more teams at the same time. The battles are mostly automatic, with preparation having more weight that the actual commands during battles. There is an option to \"stop the clock\" and adjust the strategy. Most of the gameplay involves exploring the maze-like isometric location with the player's teams, fighting enemies on the way, gathering treasure, and solving (mostly very simple) puzzles to advance to the next area. RPG element comes in form of character levels. The windows-based interface from the previous game returns, with slight adjustments (point-and-click navigation through the main area instead of clicking on arrow keys; more comfortable menu with items displayed next to the character's portrait, etc.).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184602,"FileName":"c79bcdfa-eff4-4e26-acdb-c71b128862e1.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184602,"FileName":"50e50ba6-557e-41e1-9c55-c52f716a8a65.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184602,"FileName":"d6176cdf-e754-437c-97bf-0abd1803e1d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184602,"FileName":"94514072-2911-4f6f-bd0e-c40f2606bc70.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184602,"FileName":"3cf335e9-a891-4b64-85b7-769eedaa0be0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184602,"AlternateName":"Hiōden II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188362,"Name":"Hishouzame: Flying Shark","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Hishouzame: Flying Shark is a top-down shooter similar to Raiden.

There are no significant changes to the interface, beside the addition of several context-related verbs (such as \"Take\") to the list of available commands. The navigation is also done through a menu, basically \"jumping\" from screen to screen. There is some investigating work (questioning, gathering items, etc.) to be done, but like in many Japanese adventures, advancing the story is often a matter of visiting all the locations and hoping to trigger events by \"bumping\" into characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"D.O.

Hong Kong was most affected by the mysterious demonic attack. Terrible diseases turned the once prosperous city into a pale shadow of itself. But once people came back to see what happened to the isolated city, they saw it was ruled by a new order - a corporation called SIVA. The new order proclaimed New Hong Kong to be an independent state. People's Republic of China and United Kingdom signed an agreement in which they both renounced their claims over the city.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Tianren, a \"diver\" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong, he was brought up in the house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the supernatural beings from Chinese myths.\n\nIllusion City is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike most games of the genre, it has no overworld, and takes place entirely in a vast city divided into several districts. The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.\n\nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.\n\nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"TAKERU","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184141,"FileName":"4d24ff54-da2b-4676-923e-65cecfc96a3f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184141,"FileName":"c5507fb7-9903-4050-ae62-4bec6836cb6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184141,"FileName":"fcaecf9e-8003-4415-b813-85cbcb061b45.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184141,"AlternateName":"Illusion City: Gen'ei Toshi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":203258,"Name":"Image","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Image consists of three short episodes; each episode, in its turn, contains two different scenarios.

The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Publishing International","Publisher":"Fujitsu Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188182,"FileName":"bb4a3dda-6093-40a8-8559-ad785ccb4c38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188182,"FileName":"24349913-f381-4bb8-afa9-f41d5630805e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188182,"FileName":"6fa38692-2f41-4174-96d9-06c5306789be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188182,"FileName":"015466ef-c88e-4072-8f23-e8207272cb65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188182,"FileName":"9da8f1aa-b3c8-4bdd-b55c-d4f9f62de3f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188182,"AlternateName":"Ishidoo: The Way of Stones","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188183,"Name":"Ishin no arashi","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Ishin no Arashi is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, powerful state. In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.\n\nThis strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188183,"FileName":"686d0053-ac14-428e-a253-98168dd0d805.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188183,"FileName":"25b022a2-f930-4d15-b69b-1e694656f13d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184678,"Name":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Many years ago, the dark lord Sauron forged the One Ring to control the races of the Middle Earth. He was defeated by the human prince Isildur, who took the ring to himself. But such was the evil power of the ring that it brought misfortune to whoever dared to bear it, corrupting their souls. Eventually, the ring ended up by Frodo Baggins, a peaceful hobbit who was unaware of his possession's true nature. Realizing that the only way to be free of the ring's power would be to destroy it, the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to carry it to Sauron's land, Mordor, and throw it into the lava rivers of the Orodruin volcano, thus saving Middle Earth from destruction.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I is a fantasy role-playing game based on The Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume of the Lord of the Rings book trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The events of the game follow those depicted in the book rather closely, though a few characters and occurrences are not present, and many quests have been added. Characters belonging to various races and nations join Frodo on his quest; these include key figures from the book as well as several characters unique to the game.\n\nThe game is rather open-ended, allowing the player to roam vast top-down environments and undertake side missions in addition to the main storyline, which must be followed in order to complete the game. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration, and is turn-based. The player has full control over the actions of the characters in the party. These characters can also be swapped, equipped with weapons and armor, and use various skills (individual and shared), such as sneaking, perception (to find hidden items), unique \"words of power\", and others.\n\nUnlike the vast majority of role-playing games, there are no experience points or character levels in the game. Player-controlled party becomes stronger by obtaining better equipment and items, learning new abilities, and recruiting stronger characters that would help the weak hobbits to survive encounters with Nazguls and other dangerous creatures. There are optional ways to access major locations, and much of the combat in the game can be avoided.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Interplay Productions, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"15cb1905-4993-4ab3-bdac-023316e225d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"59e6e023-f7ac-462e-b919-15d771b803a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"75e8a180-7b97-43f3-8696-61a980d22e0a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"7c2f1fdc-5216-4044-8818-db46663f3590.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"faa60104-4978-41d9-a5ae-cee099d6e379.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"5d89d4c9-c0b1-41ea-bf30-442df36a891a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184678,"FileName":"7ebe3954-ed93-45cc-8fab-6b7ec90d393f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184678,"AlternateName":"The Lord of the Rings Vol. I","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184678,"AlternateName":"Yubiwa Monogatari Daiikkan: Tabi no Nakama","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":184679,"Name":"J.R.R.

He must find the other heroes and save the planet, before it is once again controlled by the dark forces.\n\nKigen: Kagayaki no Hasha is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world, randomly appearing enemies, simple leveling up system, etc. The battles are turn-based, with a slight twist: the game doesn't pause when the player selects battles commands, similarly to Final Fantasy games. The battles are set on auto, but it is possible to input precise commands at any time. The characters utilize physical attacks and techniques, which require technique points (TP).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","Publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-05-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188190,"FileName":"4a725bd3-aebc-4548-a026-366880687768.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188190,"FileName":"3d8269b9-2ccd-4697-92f4-353161752408.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188190,"FileName":"6ed59d1d-917c-4047-ac01-89aae96a3316.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188190,"FileName":"113d1480-8b46-464f-8e02-bbf9feb67bb2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188190,"FileName":"7d253bf4-ee15-4b6c-beee-b2ac3afcbcc4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188190,"FileName":"1bdfd899-77ce-49c4-be1b-aa5e5fc82a5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188191,"Name":"Kikou Shidan: Panzer Division","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Kikō Shidan is a strategy game set during World War II, more specifically the year 1944.

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"a7121a3b-ad4e-44f5-b7b7-16c72749d8ac.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"9921f415-1b07-4a49-b73f-01564dc4a1ed.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"8b4f8e81-d7a1-4d8e-a114-1e6f5dbe732a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"10e551a4-3a3a-4314-a39e-817022b91015.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"9cf9e90c-178d-415c-8ed0-81364e273a18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"33c507ae-c205-4444-aed5-4f9f899f098b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184618,"FileName":"2e981111-cc71-4d09-a12f-ebaa9dbc5e28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184618,"AlternateName":"King's Bounty: Nusumareta Chitsujo","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":184617,"Name":"King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.\n\nAs with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line Japan, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"48f93925-1517-4264-ac33-6605a3f8750b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"c5e6c10e-20a8-40f6-a09c-05202fbbdf67.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"2fa6adfa-61ed-4ed4-a38c-e07e0747eccc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"5da3f5e4-3949-4ccb-b9ba-7eb3d3ea7971.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"7d2d67a8-ee31-454c-a1d8-3f4ec9e27f8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"23762c3a-29b1-499c-ba85-7a857027e970.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184617,"FileName":"4e07782c-5c33-4757-a989-fa113b8eacd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188193,"Name":"Kiwame","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Kiwame is a computer adaptation of shōgi (\"Japanese chess\").

When the young sorceress Zanthia comes to that anchor, she realizes it is not the answer. Her friend Marco is in possession of a giant hand, and it looks like that hand is responsible for the sabotage. Now, Zanthia must save Kyrandia before everything else vanishes without a trace.\n\nHand of Fate is the second installment in the Kyrandia series. The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game. Interaction is possible only with highlighted objects on the screen, and is reduced to a single cursor, without the distinction of separate commands. There are also no branching dialogues.

Most of the Earth's population was wiped out. Only a few millions remained. Three years have passed, and the leading scientists of the world started working on a project to re-build the planet. But not everyone agreed with them; some people were profiting from the chaos and devastation. Those people founded a terrorist organization called \"Black Widow\", with the goal to impede the project. To counter that, project leaders hired a group of five trained agents known as \"Snipers\". The protagonist of the game is a Class-A sniper named Joe, who is about to be trained by his colleagues...\n\nL Elle is a point-and-click adventure in Japanese style (no puzzles). The interaction with the environment is performed by moving the mouse cursor around; when it is possible to interact with an object, the cursor turns into a command icon (look, talk, push, take, etc., depending on the situation). The navigation is performed by selecting locations from a menu.

Her goal is obvious: to destroy Gladstone Keep and its ruler King Richard. Scotia herself has recently become more powerful after acquiring \"the Mask\" from the Urban Mines, gaining the ability to shape-shift. She is virtually unstoppable and able to infiltrate Gladstone Keep, poisoning King Richard. If it were not for the intervention of Sorceress Dawn, the monarch would surely be dead. In order to find a cure for the King's illness, a band of heroes must set out on an adventure, and keep themselves alive from the Dark Army forces.\n\nLands of Lore: Throne of Chaos is a real-time dungeon-crawling role-playing game viewed from a first-person perspective. Players begin by choosing one of the four available protagonists: the Dracoid Ak'shel (high magic power), the Huline Kieran (high speed), and two humans: Michael (high strength) and Conrad (balanced character). Each has his weaknesses and strengths, but all abilities in the game can be eventually upgraded.\n\nMuch of the game consists of exploring pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons. Most of them contain secret areas and it is sometimes necessary to solve puzzles to advance. Real-time combat involves clicking on either the attack or magic icon for each character. Depending on their speed attribute they will need a certain amount of cooldown time before the player can activate them again. The point-and-click interface allows interaction with some background objects, sometimes eliciting comments from the protagonist or his companions.\n\nThe game does not feature manual character development, introducing instead a semi-automatic form of leveling up, where skills of the hero and the companions are divided into Fighting, Magic and Rogue skills. Each skill level will increase when killing enemies using a particular type of attack: melee weapons increase the Fighting skills, magic increases the Magic skill, and ranged weapons increase the Rogue skills. In the course of the game players will form a party of up to three heroes in the quest for the cure. The player is able to equip these characters with new weapons and armor in a \"paper doll\" styled interface. The CD version includes full speech.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Westwood Studios, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184685,"FileName":"99b94908-3367-4b33-b358-587f266fb4a2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184685,"FileName":"36f85f0d-7e8d-4fbe-884f-a1f9de55c3f5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184685,"FileName":"2ab885b5-5b2c-4a03-924c-7e5af0a369b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184685,"FileName":"2c310619-5edb-4369-867b-80b42a769fb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184685,"FileName":"04fd060b-2df6-4fba-8338-7eee508da842.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184686,"Name":"Last Armageddon","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"BrainGrey","Publisher":"BrainGrey","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184686,"FileName":"2ce3d808-48cf-42a8-87f5-0a08712416dd.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184686,"FileName":"4662a91d-2e4e-462b-a602-064ea5072051.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184686,"FileName":"09200ac7-38f8-4f09-ae65-6b02da678ab5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184686,"FileName":"5038003a-4e15-4302-828d-4ee2eacc7dfe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184686,"FileName":"d4ed5cb3-63ec-44b9-9550-669aa6061db3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184686,"FileName":"c2635e19-b2ad-4beb-bdba-713c99820dec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184686,"AlternateName":"Last Armageddon: CD Special","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":184687,"Name":"Last Survivor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Last Survivor is one of the earliest 3D third-person shooters, it involves players traversing a maze shooting at opponents.

The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.\n\nThe others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.\n\nUnlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems.\n\nBecause there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress.

The party is then free to explore much of the continent in a non-linear fashion, visiting towns and exploring pseudo-3D first-person maze-like dungeons.

The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.\n\nAfter the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.\n\nBattles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182660,"FileName":"0e382736-e519-4385-a586-25a015390b12.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182660,"FileName":"60d6ccf1-7493-4d57-ab09-9bdbb2644252.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182660,"FileName":"196e2dac-e63f-4559-a228-66930c18c747.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182660,"FileName":"c4195eb3-e254-42ba-857c-3950e465a78a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182660,"AlternateName":"Record of Lodoss War: Lodoss-tou Senki: Haiiro no Majo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182660,"AlternateName":"Record of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":146767,"Name":"Loom","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A departure from other Lucasfilm adventure games in many senses, Loom is based on a serious and complex fantasy story.

There are no \"main goal\"in the game, and no plot-advancing events; it is entirely dedicated to free-form exploration and role-playing.\n\nIn the beginning, the player creates the main character (default name Lunatic), choosing gender and background - social status, strengths and weaknesses, etc. All this affects the parameters of the character, which include strength, stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc.\n\nLike in the previous Lunatic Dawn game, the gameplay revolves around exploring the vast game world. The graphics are much more detailed in this installment, with actual locations within a city. There are more shops and places of interest to visit in each city, including the ruler's castle, as well as horse stables, where it is possible to buy a carriage to quickly transport to another city. It is possible to \"call the master\" in every location; some of the masters will join the main character. Also available for recruiting are various NPCs staying in the inn (a party can contain up to six characters). The NPCs have names and different abilities/parameters, but no distinct personalities. As before, there is a real day-by-day calendar in the game, and it is necessary to buy food rations for several days ahead if the player is planning a long journey. \"Jobs\" are available at the inns of various cities, which include treasure hunt, monster-eliminating, etc. The heroes get paid for completing those tasks.\n\nRoaming the top-down world map, the party can enter dungeons, which are viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies are visible on the screen, and a turn-based battle initiates upon contact. The player can assign general strategies to the whole party, but is only able to control directly the main character.

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.\n\nLand is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.\n\nLater on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.\n\nIf there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.\n\nThe main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents.\n\nYou can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sensible Software","Publisher":"Imagineer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188209,"FileName":"e7a85397-7371-4327-afa0-074751167ea7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188209,"FileName":"b5391ab3-770e-44cb-bc69-5a602c4251a0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188209,"FileName":"ebeb5c73-9f5e-4e6c-bbc8-271ddc5a96fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188209,"FileName":"286c6bc3-aee2-4faa-a7da-3ef5f6f435d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188209,"FileName":"4c57332a-d873-4741-919e-94d207eea01e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188209,"FileName":"5f42daf7-55ec-4c62-8c61-ad01b3e2cd56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184376,"Name":"MegaMorph","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"In the future, remains of a mysterious, highly advanced ancient civilization were discovered in a cave on a deserted planet.

But he knew he was different from other children: he could not use magic, and on his hand there was a little star. He believed that he was cursed, and so did many people in his village. He learns that the ominous cave in the Northern Mountain might hold the answers to his questions. He embarks on this journey, determined to find out the identity of his father and his true role in the world.\n\nMirage is essentially a dungeon crawler: the biggest portion of the game is spent navigating pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons (auto-mapped), fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The hero is accompanied by another character, and both participate in combat. With time the hero and his companion learn magical spells. Dungeons also contain areas where weapons and items can be purchased.\n\nThe game contains scenes with nudity and erotic images (though nothing \"hardcore\"). Many of the random enemies are pretty female demons, who disrobe when defeated.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Discovery","Publisher":"Discovery","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188214,"FileName":"a98de301-c431-4ea3-8688-b735b1905121.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188214,"FileName":"1e270c8d-d044-469f-96c7-d4ffb6823e3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188214,"FileName":"48004245-ce03-4b88-8b76-414d93481345.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188214,"FileName":"90a4d1ab-07b6-4a89-82ba-c356d38f83d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188214,"FileName":"791ace6b-9437-46b6-812b-bf77e531e057.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188215,"Name":"Mirage 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The sequel to Mirage is set in the same world and features some recurrent characters, although the protagonist and the story are different.

This changes when he befriends Tree, Neat, and Lawn, the three lovely ladies who work (of all places) in the local church.

There are also many more unique images instead of generic areas as well as hand-drawn character graphics in many scenes.\n\nThis release contains all the five cases of Misty Vol.1: Strange Naked Body, Red Fountain, Murderer's Laboratory, Tail Lights Disappearing in the Old City and Decaying Family Tree. In addition, it contains four cases exclusive to this version: Moving Target, The Young Lady's Abduction, Letter from the Red Spider and Final Countdown.\n\nThe player is presented with a graphical map of locations in the city, and much of the gameplay is dedicated to repeatedly visiting them, searching areas and questioning suspects. The gameplay is somewhat more relenting than in other Misty games, allowing re-visiting more locations without penalties.\n\nIt is possible to accuse suspects and attempt to solve the case at any point, though doing so without sufficient evidence will result in failure.

A journalist named Jonathan heads to Arkham to find out more about the dreadful rumors, and to explore the ruins of an ancient monastery. In the town, Jonathan meets other characters with their own agendas. Terrifying nightmares, like visions from the past, haunt Jonathan.

However, unlike most Japanese adventures, it uses a simple point-and-click interface for interaction. Navigation is done either through a menu command, or by selecting a location on the map of Arkham.\n\nDespite the game's connection to Lovecraft stories, its graphics are distinctly Japanese, mostly following anime-manga-style aesthetics.

When the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the Earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical Earth simply isn't there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, builds an interstellar ship. A team of four specialists is then sent into deep space to find unique parts for the construction of the Centauri Drive, a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect.\n\nPlanet's Edge is a sci-fi role-playing game with space exploration and other gameplay elements, including spaceship combat, mining for resources, trading, and light puzzle-solving. The game begins on the moonbase, where the player can access the shipyard, crew quarters, warehouse, and research lab. The player is put in control of four pre-made characters: William Dean (pilot), Katya Mershova (weapons officer), Nelson Ngatadatu (engineer), and Osai Tsakafuchi (medic) . Each of these characters can be cloned for different attribute rolls, while retaining their primary skills: astrogation and ship weapons for William; light, heavy, and hand weapons for Katya; ship repair and computers for Nelson; and first aid and xenobiology for Osai. Unlike most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points and can only become stronger by equipping better weapons and armor.\n\nThe game is completely open-ended, allowing the player to travel to any of the dozens of stars. The player physically navigates the ship on an overhead screen. Entering a star system enlarges the view, allowing the ship to orbit a planet. Though most planets cannot be landed on, a large amount remains that can be explored on foot from a top-down view similar to that of Ultima VI. Each planet is represented by an enclosed populated area, usually containing friendly NPCs as well as enemies. Advancing the storyline involves gathering clues from various characters as well as obtaining objects, many of which have to be used in other locations in a puzzle-like fashion. Combat on the ground is turn-based and can be avoided in most cases.\n\nPlanets can also be mined for various elements such as organics, metals, liquids, etc. These elements can be then brought back to the moonbase, where they can be used to produce better equipment for the crew members or upgrade the spaceship. Alien technological blueprints can also be recovered and used in the research laboratory to develop new ship models.

Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.\n\nThe Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies.

A wandering lazy and lecherous manga and anime fan named Gorō Endō teams up with a female teacher and a few students to lead an opposition force against the oppressive governing circles.\n\nPro Student G is a Japanese-style erotic comedy adventure. The player guides Gorō through a series of locations and encounters, selecting choices from a menu to trigger the next event and advance the story. Some choices have a traditional verb-object structure, while others incorporate context-specific actions, many of which are included for humorous effect.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Alice Soft","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188280,"FileName":"44952d22-0459-4d9a-8d81-f6f4802a5c8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188280,"FileName":"d1de99d7-614b-46ec-94ef-b1a963376ba9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188280,"FileName":"5a810d1a-3b10-44e3-af74-42e7818b1cc6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188280,"FileName":"26ca6f3a-dced-444d-80a4-3d0299f50924.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188280,"FileName":"392a57e7-cd2c-41b3-a5c6-639a78af4800.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188815,"Name":"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '90","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '90 is a Sports game, developed and published by Game Arts, which was released in Japan in 1990","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Game Arts","Publisher":"Game Arts","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188815,"FileName":"0eb0cc61-40df-42da-8aa0-be3c80b99824.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188815,"FileName":"6d63811d-3fc9-44fe-a512-4d6fb4c2a87e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188815,"FileName":"d0cc9283-9421-43e1-8f89-05ef13ae0b14.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188815,"AlternateName":"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium: 90-nendo Pennant Race-ban","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188282,"Name":"Professional Mahjong Gokuu","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Professional Mahjong Gokū features several variations of the game of four-player mahjong.

Overworld and towns are shown from top-down view, but dungeons are navigated in a pseudo-3D first-person fashion (without an automap), similarly to Phantasy Star.

In story mode (which is based on characters from Compile's RPG series Madō Monogatari), the player controls Arle Nadja (Silvana in the English translation of the arcade version), a young sorceress, whose goal is to defeat Satan. To do so, she has to win 12 battles against his minions until she can meet him in a final confrontation. The game offers an extra training mode against three lesser opponents, as well as the ability to start from level 4 of the main game.\n\nDuring a match, pairs of puyos fall down from the top of the screen into each player's field. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to arrange puyos of the same color into patterns of at least four, with horizontal or vertical (but no diagonal) connections. Doing so removes them from the field (with any unconnected puyos falling down) while at the same time sending garbage blocks into the opponent's field. Creating patterns of more than four, several different patterns at the same time, or chain reactions creates more garbage blocks. The garbage blocks can only be removed by creating patterns adjacent to them. The player whose playing field reaches the top first loses. In single-player mode, the falling speed of the puyos increases level by level and each of the enemies plays in a unique style.\n\nThe home ports also add an endless single-player mode, in which there is no opponent (and thus no garbage blocks) and one simply plays for a high score, similar to the MSX/Famicom version.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"CSK Research Institute Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"eba2d586-301c-4767-9e97-451a969ade38.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"67629d5d-6d7a-4477-a19a-744f521ef5e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"42165d52-c191-4d39-aeb9-fb8069d23fe9.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"ac605287-3ee8-4493-bf89-d923195fa2fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"d3b38739-c130-4e32-b011-0ac5e292bf90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"f1b6d2b1-a008-4286-a4e7-53dde9cf42f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184588,"FileName":"b8898f84-4e68-47eb-817f-ab534ebd4a92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184589,"Name":"Puzznic","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.\n\nThere are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Ving Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184589,"FileName":"dc2d5e60-da6f-4468-ae23-c841a55be530.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184589,"FileName":"21d9d8ef-a060-4799-89fc-ab3c68fa50ad.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184589,"FileName":"6a2b6e13-4043-430e-b730-2646fb6678bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184589,"FileName":"bfd6ba73-2769-460a-8175-2c87b4b3fa04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184589,"FileName":"ba1ae6a5-eab5-4cb1-a47f-afbdeb4b3821.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203197,"Name":"Quiz Banchou: 3-Takun 2","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"You play a gang leader (bancho) and his girlfriend as they travel the world, battling peoplein quiz games, and stripping their accompanying female.

Unlike first-generation interactive movies with action, the game has hooks into the environment: if the player-controlled fighter moves into the path of a pre-rendered obstacle, there is a collision and the craft takes damage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Fujitsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156651,"FileName":"25322c88-0036-4dea-83b3-2702c29fcfff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156651,"FileName":"c4956c73-f9e6-490f-808e-735b48746660.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156651,"AlternateName":"Novastorm","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188311,"Name":"Schwarzschild IV: The Cradle End","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"The Cradle End is the fourth entry in the Schwarzschild series.

The player takes control of Clair Youngleaf, the leader of one of these nations, who must decide its future fate through diplomacy and wars.\n\nThe game's concept is identical to that of the previous installments of the series. Like before, grand strategy is the core of the game, while the actual battles proceed automatically, their outcome depending on the player's preparation rather than on tactical decisions. The interface has been changed once again, featuring windows that can be stretched and moved around. There are more diplomatic options and stronger emphasis on pacts and cooperation between nations. It is also possible to research and build fighter craft, as well as place satellites in space and cannons on planet surfaces. Like the previous game, The Cradle End has anime-style visuals and assigns individual characteristics to nation leaders.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188311,"FileName":"e7a2e733-fcc4-4db5-b91f-66505019b1dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188311,"FileName":"54b3af55-90a6-40c3-b6fa-bdd50d512e16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188311,"FileName":"6a7c8afb-6f3f-4020-9f43-894962ee7ce6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188312,"Name":"Schwarzschild: Kyouran no Ginga","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"By the year 3260, humans have mastered interstellar travel and successfully colonized almost the entire Milky Way.

As the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes his father's face. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.\n\nShadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Creative Assembly","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157262,"FileName":"d8e30757-4418-4c9d-8dd2-56fb591aad1a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157262,"FileName":"fccfe9cf-4385-4b9e-b217-f30be4f41762.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157262,"AlternateName":"Shadow of the Beast: Mashou no Okite","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":184109,"Name":"Shadow of the Beast II: Juushin no Jubaku","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Essentially a side-on scrolling beat 'em up in the vain of The Way of the Exploding Fist, but with an epic storyline and puzzles a-plenty.\n\nThe introduction, now an Amiga classic, shows the Beast-mage stealing your infant sister and the purpose of the game is to rescue her back.

Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority.\n\nThe battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters.\n\nAfter each round of victory, the female general removes an item of her clothing.

Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long career, which involves saving the kingdom and becoming a true hero.\n\nThe gameplay of Shinc is also very unpretentious: it's a first-person dungeon crawler with a basic combat system.

Twenty-four years later, a special all-female unit known as Attacked Mystification Police was formed to combat the enemy.\n\nCase: Titanic is based on the manga and anime Silent Möbius. It presents an original episode that involves the sighting of a strange ship in the clouds above Tokyo.

The game's nameless male protagonist boards the ship along with Rally, Kiddy, Nami and other heroines from the manga in order to investigate this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon.\n\nThe gameplay is done in Japanese-style, puzzle-less adventure format. The entire game is set on the Titanic. The player is generally free to visit various areas of the ship in any order, though access to certain locations is restricted and necessary events must be triggered in order to gain it.

The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Headroom","Publisher":"Japan Home Video Co.

While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.\n\nSpace Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.\n\nInterstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first.\n\nIt is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others.\n\nWhen docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Wave Train","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184542,"FileName":"3d703944-9a56-48a5-b3a5-0e6b11e74e9d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184542,"FileName":"89cae26b-e3b5-426d-8976-db69b2685757.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184542,"FileName":"13150f76-0e01-461a-87b6-5986e9d0ddef.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184542,"FileName":"1b7cc937-5627-4d54-a99e-b3541b426bcd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184542,"FileName":"b1f40d99-af7c-423e-a77b-5c8b818b16d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184542,"FileName":"607c6522-424d-4f17-953f-065027e0923a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124910,"Name":"Splatterhouse","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Splatterhouse (?????????

Gameplay concept and visual style are very similar to that of the predecessor: it is a first-person 3D shooter with extensive exploration and customization elements, which grants it a light role-playing angle. Much of the game is spent on planet surfaces, in populated or hostile areas. Combat is action-based by default, but there is an option for a menu-based combat as well. There is a variety of weapons, armor, gadgets, and items to find or purchase. It is also possible to physically navigate a spaceship. Combat in space plays similarly to on-foot battles, with the additional of a freely rotatable camera.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Arsys Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Japan Home Video Co.

However, it still retains the emotional response system (only three out of five are present: \"nice\", \"angry\", and \"sad\"), which is sometimes needed to steer conversation.

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.\n\nIf Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs.\n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Ving","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156644,"FileName":"e44f310d-6148-45a8-8f16-85e4dea8b0d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156644,"FileName":"86a44e98-1d27-4034-ab71-529cc57a54b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156644,"FileName":"8454e53e-73ef-4829-9501-096953c17b37.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156644,"FileName":"9e5ba9f9-b40b-44a2-bb2e-080450778718.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188292,"Name":"The Queen of Duellist","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"The Queen of Duellist is an erotic all-female versus fighting game.

The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.\n\nThe puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous \"insult swordfighting\", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates.\n\nThe CD DOS and FM Towns versions of the game have slightly updated interface (with graphically represented inventory items instead of the text-only labels in the original version), as well as CD audio music tracks.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"bbce79bc-b39c-4925-9278-8a1b68531ecd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"4a250aba-5c95-44cc-ae95-a08dbbf0e48b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"daa003da-9013-470c-b706-f79d8580ad1e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"06382ee8-735a-41e9-929e-18f6eb75fe6d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"825cbea8-9ebc-4ea0-b12e-85568b296e01.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"ad489c05-f4ba-4d77-bba0-a94acd201b49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"3ee3f099-a11b-47cd-b80c-6b321473a2c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"e99ade70-f9f6-425c-96af-7aa2898c6518.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157260,"FileName":"8335c83e-91e0-4403-b690-8b73fae03eab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199999,"Name":"The Silent Service: Chinmoku no Kantai","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"G.A.M","Publisher":"G.A.M.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":199999,"FileName":"7a836aa6-bf24-49a6-a224-3e622977d297.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":199999,"FileName":"c466f5cf-2c8d-4cf7-89bc-72049dc0422a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199999,"FileName":"39f572bb-156e-4b30-a2e2-0bf992c4a422.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184611,"Name":"The Visitor","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"The Visitor is an Adventure game, developed and published by Fujitsu, which was released in Japan in 1989","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Fujitsu","Publisher":"Fujitsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184611,"FileName":"c4d6e77a-a638-4483-81bc-9e1e1b619cf0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184611,"FileName":"85aaf1e3-773c-4b44-a303-623e3029036f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184611,"FileName":"3e97d9ca-a811-4867-bf90-37baf342e7c3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184611,"FileName":"d8aa84b3-71b7-41df-896b-514bcd27e58f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201343,"Name":"Theme Park","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog.

Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.\n\nThe labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.\n\nTitan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels).

Humanity spread all over the Milky Way. Most of the problems concerning war, ecological disasters, and others were successfully solved. Human beings have entered an era of peace. But human nature never changes, and most other aspects of human culture haven't either. Since the galaxy became a huge urban playground, a new type of criminals have emerged - interstellar thieves. Piloting their own space ship, they terrorize the galaxy with their cleverly planned tricks. Particularly notorious is a duo of two young and pretty girls, Sati and Shiori... which are the two protagonists of the game.\n\nFunny Bee has a few turn-based battle at pre-set points, during which the playable character executes various attack techniques; however, the system is too rudimentary to be considered a major part of gameplay. The rest of the game plays rather like an adventure in Japanese style. The player chooses menu commands, triggering events and advancing the story. There are also locations with an auto-map, for more convenient navigation (also menu-based). The game contains scenes with nudity.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Alice Soft","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188340,"FileName":"e3f367a0-80a7-47e6-8a88-2db93b6ac4e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166831,"Name":"Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following the defeat of the evil triad in the previous three Ultima games, the world of Sosaria changed beyond recognition: continents rose and sank, and new cities were built, heralding the advent of a different civilization. Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. \n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.\n\nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.\n\nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.\n\nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Origin Systems","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1992-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"22c4f9b8-d34c-4d82-869e-9c5b9377abb9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"26bd17a2-1540-4022-9eb8-74b063a83c80.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"f8462cff-40b1-4238-bfc2-218b04439d11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"d685ec59-83c1-4d2a-8083-858f12aaced8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"e5dc8cbe-5f56-46fd-ab1d-123748c7f3c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"c7774fb8-91f5-4861-bd12-848dd9f882c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"7af461cf-21b9-4b49-8cfb-f3437ae84189.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166831,"FileName":"c7f67d68-b3bf-455d-8638-590312d10e06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156655,"Name":"Ultima Trilogy: I ♦ II ♦ III","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"This compilation contains:\n\nUltima\nUltima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress\nExodus: Ultima III\n\nThe FM Towns version has re-vamped graphics: overworld and towns look on par with Ultima IV, while the detail in the dungeon graphics is close to the level of the fifth game (as opposed to simple vector lines in the other versions).

To celebrate the defeat of the Guardian, Lord British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle. However, in the night of the feast the Guardian attacks again, encasing the castle in a giant gem of blackrock. Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must travel to these worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.\n\nThis sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its 3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender, class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit points and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an interactive world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved.\n\nThe game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of its predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, an alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and sound have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been increased, there are new monster graphics and the game now features digitized sound effects.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Looking Glass Technologies, Inc.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166886,"FileName":"58b39fae-880c-4d29-a209-20b59a982a2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166886,"FileName":"68fa1672-a0b7-4cb7-8d2c-2dac6fb960bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166886,"FileName":"1ebabd05-aeef-4140-9ffe-381dc0f20aba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166886,"FileName":"ad9d0f92-b192-4c26-963b-f33c05795953.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166886,"FileName":"31d7c2f3-20e8-4daf-ba37-589ee51dc655.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166886,"FileName":"4b4f425c-8b2e-4d12-8588-d86c59cb6552.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166885,"Name":"Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After having brought peace to Britannia during his previous journey there, the Avatar returns to our world. However, he is haunted by ghostly dreams that warn him of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar decides to travel there once again. Upon his arrival, he witnesses the kidnapping of Baron Almric's daughter. Found guilty of the crime, the Avatar is thrown into the Great Stygian Abyss with the choice of either finding the girl or rotting in the dungeon. On his journey he will have to get along with the many inhabitants of the dungeon, who are survivors of a failed colony, and eventually find out that there's much more to this kidnapping than meets the eye.\n\nUltima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is commonly considered the first role-playing game with fluid first-person movement in a real 3D environment. Unlike earlier first-person RPGs such as Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The player is also able to look up and down with the press of a key, jump, and swim. The dungeon is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion, but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges, underground rivers, and more.\n\nThe game's combat system is action-oriented. The player has to draw his weapon, aim at his opponent, and hold the cursor over the game screen to inflict damage; the longer the player holds it, the stronger is the attack. Some weapons have different types of attacks, depending on where the cursor is held: for example, jabs are executed when the cursor is near the bottom of the screen, while slashes are performed with the cursor in the middle.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player chooses the gender, the class, and the initial skills for the Avatar. Skills include various weapon proficiencies, lockpicking, bartering, and others. They can be increased by reciting mantras at special shrines after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points. Leveling up also increases the Avatar's hit points and mana. The magic system is based on runes that can be found in the Abyss. If combined in the right order, they produce a magical effect. \n\nAs the Abyss is populated by more than just monsters, there are various conversations the Avatar can conduct with non-playable characters. The player can also make choices regarding the Avatar's behavior towards these characters. Game progression is largely non-linear: the player is able to explore most of the Abyss in any order, though several specific tasks must be accomplished in order to complete the story. An auto-map displays all the locations the player has explored previously, and also allows the player to make notes on it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Blue Sky Productions","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"828fc7e1-95c5-47f9-9fb4-db83a98b74e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"fa945ecb-29cc-4cb6-97ad-ab5fdafdd0a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"8cbba639-4483-425d-a895-b2da473a4ef8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"59a62ef3-38bd-42c0-88d7-ce33f41189ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"a412df3e-7b6e-44d3-97c0-44532eae0f3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"f518a2c6-17fb-4b0a-9827-1aeb06e5067e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"21a4c9e8-c066-4bc2-942a-66eff9b58e19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"0ae744b0-68dd-4530-9972-c0a9956d4f3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":166885,"FileName":"d2f72aa8-b784-4d46-a03c-e6150f7c44de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157264,"Name":"Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.\n\nUltima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to four.\n\nAdditional challenges include navigating characters through the Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar; inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and others.\n\nThe game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a day/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping. Dialogues with NPCs have been enhanced, featuring more unique and detailed conversation topics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Origin Systems","Publisher":"Fujitsu Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"3423da94-0d9f-451b-a954-1c94bde5f27b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"1a07a511-db47-41bd-b7c6-0d8b4a25890a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"4f339bc2-2977-4921-a70d-0d89eab9ea11.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"212445a3-80dd-4b68-8ccc-66ffaff7ec97.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"58071f98-e0cb-4417-8aa5-0ed47ea1e9d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"e69feaa3-7afa-49d8-9eaf-12deb2c17098.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"299db2f5-b660-4459-adce-f58e98c22669.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"5dfcb7b1-80a1-4ac9-bbb6-a6285e724fc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"59c7ec3f-9f3c-4fdf-8558-74912186311a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157264,"FileName":"5c92c298-77b2-46d8-9cc2-327536382e37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145080,"Name":"Ultima VI: The False Prophet","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Several years after having restored Lord British to his rightful position as the monarch of Britannia, the Avatar is captured by demon-like creatures and placed on a sacrificial altar. His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.\n\nUltima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no \"world map\" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved. \n\nThe interface has been re-designed, the original key-bound commands co-existing with selectable command icons and mouse-based interaction. The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters. The player is also able to conduct extensive conversations with the Avatar's companions, as well as split the party and control the characters separately. Some important topics may be highlighted during text display, to facilitate further dialogue, which requires the player to type the desired conversation topics.\n\nLike in the predecessors, the player is free to explore the game world from the beginning of the game, and visit locations in any order. Following the main quest and obtaining specific items and information is necessary to complete the story; however, the player can also opt to bypass a large part of it by using previous knowledge of the game or outside help. The FM Towns version has full voice acting for all the conversations, in English and in Japanese.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C7lR-3fY-M","Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Fujitsu Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"6dcd9dba-22fc-4134-970a-787f7f619e15.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"d3f2b4f0-a584-4ba2-9818-66fc53119619.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"e1b13843-5bf8-495f-b944-c4b3a016b029.jpg","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"f772731c-4d67-42cd-96e4-bebaa443cb19.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"0f17972b-c474-49b2-8474-cdca1921a8b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"e0eb2ba1-6346-4731-8103-9b15e78ff64a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"7ad61c21-7b71-4e19-9091-a81fa3e3250d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145080,"FileName":"2432075a-833c-4c37-aa27-95e119030912.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":145080,"AlternateName":"ウルティマVI 偽りの予言者","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":201344,"Name":"URM: M15 Wakusei ni Umarete","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Beluga Computer","Publisher":"Japan Home Video","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":201344,"FileName":"d9211df1-ce85-4659-a8d9-1430596483ac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202014,"Name":"Ushinawareta Rakuen","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"College student Kojima Kousaku is promised a high payment for assistance in scientific expedition on a southern island.

To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.\n\nVain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"74d34c23-d13f-47d2-8ddb-1ed7078a17e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"eb86c366-1ae6-4d85-a67a-b1b683db83a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"1d6bf73a-c83b-4fd8-94b5-22d28e0383d8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"61c607f0-8869-49a5-ac5c-a610b895c71e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"e3445a5a-b85d-4e05-8a56-4c425e21f582.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"03a33ab4-68cc-4217-897a-c52bf6a8b331.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185087,"FileName":"040670b0-756a-4692-b759-4ec04fee808a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185088,"Name":"Vain Dream II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The land of Kureia enjoyed a peaceful existence, until the beautiful, but deadly Goddess of Darkness decided to make it her own land, imposing a rule of terror on its people. Finally, the Golden Dragon of the Sun and the Silver Dragon of the Moon interfered. In a titanic battle, they perished together with the evil goddess. To protect further safety of Kureia, 108 dragons descended onto the Earth. The new age of peace lasted until a mysterious knight entered the shrine of the Ice Dragon, killing the guards and the dragon himself. A young hunter named Warrick, together with his friends, must find out who did this. The quest for peace begins...\n\nVain Dream 2 is not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, but shares with it its gameplay mechanics. The Japanese style of its RPG system is evident in linear story progression, emphasis on characterization of party members (up to five members, as opposed to three in the previous game), and automatic leveling up. However, as in the first Vain Dream, there are no random battles, and the turn-based combat system allows free movement on the battle field, creating an illusion of real-time combat. The player has direct control only over the party leader; the rest are controlled by AI, but can be assigned general strategies. Leveling up of weapons is possible, if a character keeps using a specific type of weapon in battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"152e6f84-5aa4-405a-98ca-5b65f33a5f6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"d9316ec5-ac63-45ca-9d17-1ea81c13cb52.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"232c4402-354e-4b57-9f1f-4f906d6f648e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"f84a3680-0a85-45f7-95d2-1f424d1fbd3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"a73d50a0-3d43-41cb-a343-84a4b2442168.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"749d4a5e-9dec-49ad-a4d5-efac7e6fb256.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185088,"FileName":"99a6d81c-4095-4873-8e8b-9fd320c909b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197150,"Name":"Vampire High School","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Interheart","Publisher":"Interheart","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197150,"FileName":"491c580b-30fb-4698-961d-1ea9ce12f8f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201345,"Name":"Vanishing Point: Tenshi no Kieta Machi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kusanagi is a high school student.

Ever since he's used his powers to cut off contact with the outside world, Kairn has been living it up, torturing the villagers with madness and death, feeding off of them like livestock and turning the village women into his personal vampiress servants. Meanwhile, the villagers are miserable, as every day they face the possibility of either being devoured by werewolves, gnawed on by zombies, driven into stark raving lunatics, or turned into vampires by Kairn and his posse.\n\nA cargo pilot's plane is shot down by a mysterious force while flying over a remote valley in Romania. A helpful village girl named Deirdre rescues him from the crash and takes him to her father Kiril, who informs the pilot that his arrival via plane crash marks him as the chosen one who is prophesied to destroy Kairn. Since Kairn has cut off all ways out of the valley, the only way he is going to leave is, as the old saying goes, over his dead body. That's not going to be very easy, however. Wild animals and unnatural creatures roam the countryside. While some villagers will help the hero to rid them of Kairn, others have been driven mad with despair and by the valley's oppressive aura, causing them to commit unspeakable acts or otherwise act in an unhelpful manner. Even the most trusted allies may turn out to have a few skeletons in the closet...\n\nVeil of Darkness is an isometric role-playing game with action-based combat and adventure elements. Most of the game is dedicated to exploring the game world in a fairly open-ended fashion, gathering information and items. Puzzle-solving is conversation- and inventory-based; many battles are also designed in a puzzle-like manner, with the hero being able to defeat certain enemies only with specific weapons. Heavy inventory management and status ailments contribute to the game's RPG mechanics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Event Horizon Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Ving Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188342,"FileName":"3f82a710-880e-448e-b88b-4d13083e21b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188342,"FileName":"26a63a45-9436-4e52-8e35-b3b89580faee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188342,"FileName":"191b584f-fdbb-46b2-86f1-7e87e30c0a17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188342,"FileName":"2530144e-9c2b-4aa5-89fd-453f0ce265e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188342,"FileName":"f0508b73-a226-4177-8362-4786ad1128ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188342,"FileName":"875a8b20-32ad-4c83-adf5-edadeb8016de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156657,"Name":"Viewpoint","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon.

Volfied is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an ship/object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along. When not cutting the ship is protected by a shield the shield decreases over time and when it hits zero the enemies can also killl you when not cutting.\n\nThe player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it.

Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the \"Maelstrom\" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.\n\nWizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"ad795b99-6af5-43a0-8698-ef5c68d9bf6e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"2ad2cf98-40f7-4d73-bba4-487994d01235.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"95844a66-eae2-444d-a0eb-3aaf28fe5d21.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"c286a74f-c20a-43c7-8e57-12a2835ce765.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"3963a03b-afb5-430d-a28e-47c3032329d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"c8fa8463-45cd-43f5-ba59-a14537863e44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184609,"FileName":"f6ff35c8-3576-4ec4-9766-9d97e3ddad44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184608,"Name":"Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the seventh installment of the Wizardry series and a direct sequel to Bane of the Cosmic Forge. In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.\n\nThe heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied with.\n\nThe gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events, as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text messages.\n\nA few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184608,"FileName":"72dcef10-16f8-422b-9fe4-388e0967dd25.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184608,"FileName":"880781be-b244-47c8-8273-aa11a2b516c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184608,"FileName":"4fe36f03-81de-4da3-b247-0b0899289428.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184608,"FileName":"441d305c-73bf-49d9-852f-2c74d19bd4c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184608,"FileName":"235edc7b-495a-4acd-9e38-731484b4970f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184608,"AlternateName":"Wizardry VII: Gadeia no Houshu","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184608,"AlternateName":"Wizardry: Crusaders of the Dark Savant","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":125228,"Name":"Wizardry: Bane of the Cosmic Forge","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true.

It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up.

Men, women, and animals lived together in peace. But where there is God, there is also Devil; where there is love, there is also hatred. The hatred between men and women grew, until it resulted in a bloody war. Having superior physical strength, men were victorious for a while - until female demons offered their help to women's army. Men's army was nearly destroyed. It was at that time that the hero, named Leopard Chateau-Lyon, appeared in Wandante. He is the only hope of the men, the one who will have to defeat the demonic women and to bring peace to both genders.\n\nWonpara Wars is a strategy board game which is somewhat similar to chess, but with much simpler rules (and decidedly much simpler than the Japanese chess, shogi). Some pieces are identical to those of Western chess (bishop), or move similarly to Western chess pieces, but have different names (\"magicians\" who move similarly to rooks); \"soldiers\" can walk in all directions, including backwards. There are also treasure chess scattered around the board, which can be captured by both the player's and the enemy army.\n\nThe battles are dictated by the plot; there are cut scenes before and after each battle, and they take place in different locations. The enemy army has a \"boss\" piece, unique for each battle. The battle is won when one of the sides has captured enough enemy pieces. Whenever the player's piece captures an enemy piece, a hentai scene occurs, typically showing a girl taking off her battle clothes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fujitsu FM Towns Marty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Mink","Publisher":"Mink","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":198896,"FileName":"a069b2c9-9cfe-4089-9222-f096bd310b39.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":198896,"FileName":"5df26967-58e3-48d8-b186-e9361b28b476.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":198896,"FileName":"d685dd9f-9b9d-4128-836b-7dc5cdf5d482.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":198896,"FileName":"e98f1874-05d3-478c-a369-b32add2f011f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":198896,"FileName":"9bbdde83-bab1-4695-b66a-a66fe23096d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192868,"Name":"Wonpara Wars II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The protagonist of the first game, Leopard Chateau-Lyon, finds himself wandering in a forest, having no memory of his own past, except his name. He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named man, who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country.\n\nWonpara Wars II follows the same principle as its predecessor: defeat the enemy army in chess-like battles, watch the cut scene, advance to the next stage. The rules for the board game itself are more complex. There are new pieces, taken from Western chess (knight) as well as original ones (ninja). The rules differ from known chess variants in several ways (random treasure chests can change the movement rules of a piece; many types of pieces can move only forward, etc.). The pieces also differ by gender: knights look like men, bishops like women, etc. Each army has a \"master\" piece, which represents the hero and the enemy general, correspondingly.

To sustain peace and harmony between the tribes, a huge stone tablet called Words Worth was erected.\n\nBut one day, someone has shattered the tablet. Both Tribes blamed each other and began a bloody war that has been raging for hundred years. Finally, the king of the Shadow Tribe sends his son, the brave Astral, to find out what really happened to the tablets, and to restore peace in the world.\n\nWords Worth is primarily a first-person dungeon crawler. Even though there are a few \"friendly\" areas, such as a town where the hero can rest and buy supplies, most of the game is spent in dungeon-like, maze-like areas (with an auto-map feature). There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based.
