The first, being in a better geographical position, having all the resources in abundance while the latter strife to survive in the barren lands. Both nations were at peace until the Mokai unleashed an attack towards their neighbour country Asylia.\n\nYou control an elite \"Sky Guard\" named Rohn, who belongs in the dragon-riding forces of Asylian army, and tries to stop this assault while at the same time figuring out if there are any deeper reasons behind this seemingly struggle for survival.\n\nIn each stage you get mission objectives ranging from defending a castle town to eliminating catapults and armies. The gameplay makes extensive use of the SIXAXIS motion sensor since most of the time you'll be fighting on the air and the movement there is solely dependent on this feature. While in the air you can throw fire to scorch your enemies or engage in a melee mode with other dragons where you can use bites, claws and combo attacks. At times you may also need to fight with your dragon while on ground or have your character battle another dragon-rider while on top of this rider’s dragon.\n\nWhen you end the mission, depending on how well you did, you may earn a medal (bronze\/silver\/gold) which in turn allows you to learn new combat moves and unlock extra content in the \"Extras\" option of the main menu.\n\nThere is also a Lair Network option where you can check (while on-line) other players’ stats and achievements.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=467zs7pt0wE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lair_(video_game)"},"45":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kojima Productions","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Shooter; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"2e5fd06c-3741-4edf-ab49-a2e6bf06d8cf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c56a6db6-a6f2-4bdf-b1b0-33799733af02.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"42b017b5-2f16-4819-8e20-1108507958ef.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"28dccbd4-3ba9-4f88-b9c6-32b64bb0c3ae.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"14416989-8587-4352-a3a5-88f27fff64f8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"00c65413-8f6d-437a-9990-cbd8be39fbbe.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d6a70df3-2ade-4517-8d2f-a9113b94fa6d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fe4c4ff9-d75b-4913-a9ec-8b88db84f312.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"38d572c3-30ad-418d-9142-4f35628c7c85.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b887753d-7676-4643-9198-993c64859e9b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"719658b6-fe15-4450-9974-ffac68235a94.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"21a0f7c0-f2e5-488f-b3a2-2783fc32eb9b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e6827096-241d-4cdb-9814-06d2a06f7a88.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f4355e95-19b0-4152-8a34-3814f3cdd73d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6024cdf0-062c-4955-8d5c-a0b6478c380f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cf0eda83-37a7-47f4-90da-e8802c046c79.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9d3c8227-641d-40a7-8b3a-3c6e21c781de.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"65a4851a-d3ef-49ea-afbe-36875bd712ce.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0b87def4-48d6-4d3b-a2b9-8c6132f578c2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e5f6a142-3095-4837-bb0a-8f7e2098d2c9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8b684bd-906f-48fc-99d3-6f1bae0e5d7b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97b83492-4b4c-43a8-8e28-139ab9628aed.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5b95679-0595-4473-84b4-cf557d172362.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"8820ddd6-a21f-4747-92fa-212f874a64be.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c53469ad-92ea-4cb2-8b89-ace806ba08e0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots","Overview":"A legendary soldier.

It was developed by Omega Force and published by Bandai Namco Games. Its gameplay is derived from Koei's popular Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series.[1] The \"Official Mode\" of the game is based primarily on the Universal Century timeline, with mecha from Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ appearing in the game,[2] as well as a few units from Mobile Suit Variations Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory appearing as non-playable ally and enemy units. The \"Original Mode\" of the game also features mecha from the non-UC series Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and ∀ Gundam. A newly designed non-SD Musha Gundam designed by Hajime Katoki is also included.[3]\n\nThe game was originally released on March 1, 2007 in Japan[4] exclusively for the PlayStation 3 with the name Gundam Musou. A North American version was released on August 28, 2007, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 under the name Dynasty Warriors: Gundam [5] with English localization by AltJapan Co., Ltd.[6] Dynasty Warriors: Gundam is the second next-gen Gundam game released in North America, following Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire. A Japanese Xbox 360 version was released in Japan on October 25, 2007 under the name of Gundam Musou International.

Once activated, a reddish energy aura appears around the character, and their health bar starts to flicker in red. The rage aura can be customized with different colors and effects to appear like fire, electricity, ice, among others. Another gameplay feature added is the \"bound\" system. Every character has several moves that, when used on an opponent that is currently midair in a juggle combo, will cause the opponent to be smashed hard into the ground, bouncing them off the floor in a stunned state and leaving them vulnerable to another combo or additional attack. As of the Bloodline Rebellion update, successfully parrying a low attack will also put a character into a bound state.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cS0O-o9qY9I","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tekken_6"},"854":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FromSoftware, Inc.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"85b89ac8-d4ef-4609-9c3a-7a532917da0b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8f9abcb3-26bc-402d-b4b3-e321b0a59348.jpg","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7b57e128-bd6c-4122-850a-1612c1004f23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"41ca4f20-9993-41e0-a7d3-8117be4a425f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fe5d6cf6-ef30-4643-b817-2b5c4c466399.png","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"60c593c6-72b2-4558-8caf-27cd8eeaee05.jpg","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05c999cb-b715-4892-ae68-4f1347f68fb9.png","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"136ab9b9-2781-45be-b62d-5e2bbde5f0bf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed20109d-8c83-45ac-bd79-4a173745fde7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a5c4fcd-2085-4a93-948f-14b850919edd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a50c0c9d-0101-438a-b4ad-d724fbde0b76.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9218f8d4-1d84-48e7-9d00-b6de30f89035.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"90c25877-2dcf-4c5a-a8cf-d23b6ae7cc4b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7c8a27ad-7b64-49c1-9453-c9d3743a955a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cb601976-3468-4e76-8c68-572a142721a9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"82418226-1867-48ca-8ef1-a7424e071e52.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ee6be799-a065-4e71-a8f1-35946d096403.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"635eaafb-3305-442c-81c0-cbc0d1a3f733.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"625dcc06-9a7f-4b0c-879d-5cc1e18863e8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"caa0b4ad-679a-4762-be4d-2df124cc7579.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1b90f67f-36a8-4301-9ddd-b49bc356b149.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5c28eb46-5edb-49bc-becf-e38d1d3e8f2a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ed510309-22e0-44d1-a96e-0aeabf094fc1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4533484c-81d8-446c-9e3b-3828ced7f705.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f26b5c7d-1fbb-4825-ac6f-800f8966a341.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ff7d3bd8-3755-49c3-b0f9-bca57ade99eb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"66dc2217-aa5c-48aa-ba48-29a13928b80f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"440654ce-6cb8-4df9-9893-b6076fb857f5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":3,"Name":"Demon's Souls","Overview":"King Allant the XII, the last king of Boletaria, searched tirelessly to expand his might.

The battle system is a mixture of real-time and turn-based controls. The game consists of battle elements such as command battles and action battles. Players start the battle by selecting one of the player's characters to control, following which the player takes direct control over the character. The player can then move the character around and attack targets. The character's turn ends when the player's attack is over or his action points are all used up. Enemies are also able to move while the player's character is moving and will usually attack only the character being controlled by the player. Players can restart any enemy encounter if they are defeated during battle, and for a hefty fee can replenish health or even an important resource called bezel energy.

Eggman uses a device to extract the Chaos Emeralds' power, and inverts it, sending a blast to the planet below which shatters Earth into pieces, reawakening a being called Dark Gaia. With Sonic no longer of use to him, Dr. Eggman quickly jettisons him and the now dead Chaos Emeralds into space, where he crash-lands on the Earth below.\n\nSonic Unleashed is a combination of two types of games: during daytime stages, Sonic is his normal self, with intense speed-based levels that are reminiscent of his original games. When night falls, Sonic transforms into a monstrous, yet powerful 'Werehog' with stretchy arms. In nighttime stages, he must brawl his way through 3D environments crawling with Dark Gaia's minions.\n\nAs players defeat enemies in both types of stages, they earn experience which allows them to level both Sonic's normal and Werehog abilities, such as speed, strength, life, combat and so on. There are also 3D hub worlds to be explored during both day and night, with different events occurring in each. Sonic can help the townsfolk with tasks for items and rewards, or purchase items from shops using the rings he's collected throughout the stages.\n\nSonic's buddy Tails also makes an appearance during stages where they fly his plane. During these stages, you must press the appropriate button sequences as they appear to shoot down any oncoming enemies.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sonic_Unleashed"},"930":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Evolution Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"da907b5d-63f0-463c-9dca-f7d5f998f8ae.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8e264d24-04d3-4a17-ab3b-8e1e87d676e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e6c2156c-e221-4c8a-9093-9d38c41d0dae.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3e4c9164-b8a8-48bc-84ac-2c43edf9eb8e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0697ebaa-db48-4f92-ba34-a1dd10c90e30.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a7980056-6e8a-4a83-8548-a802bb5d87dc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c84b5a70-71fe-477c-bf77-e508a24f3b5d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ebf74744-91ca-4db0-af10-70b1e406c655.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"MotorStorm: Apocalypse","Overview":"MotorStorm: Apocalypse (released as MotorStorm 3 in Asia) is a 2011 racing 3D video game by Evolution Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3.

Now, in the skill tree there are individual classes in which players can spend their skill points. These classes include Assault, Marksman, Close Quarters, Special Ops, Medical, Engineering, Athleticism, Vehicles, and Resistances, which then branches off into their own skill tree. Players now in the supply depot have a balance which is money that is earned from every match. So instead of getting the weapons\/attachments in the skill tree they can now be purchased separately. After an item is bought players have the choice of selling that item for half of its original price. Patch v1.05 introduced a modified leadership selection algorithm that relies on using leadership points that are earned by winning battles while being at least a squad leader and whether the player has a Bluetooth headset or not.\n\nBasic battles take place within ongoing, faction-based campaigns to encourage the player to actively play.[9][13] The game's E3 unveiling trailer featured large landscapes, tactics such as air strikes and parachuting, and a variety of vehicles, from tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs) to airplanes.[9][13]\n\nPlayers were able to customize the face, voice, and armor of their characters, as well as what weapons and kit they carry into battle.[4][14] In game, the player could level up to 70 on any faction. After achieving level 70, players could enter the Veteran mode and select a new faction (or, if a player chooses so, Veteran in the same faction as before). Veteran mode wipes out the current progress and makes the player start from scratch, although the medals, ribbons, statistics and the leadership points player has earned in the past remain intact. Player also receives a +10% XP bonus which increases the leveling speed. Veteran bonuses do not stack, which means that the +10% remains no matter how many times player has used this mode. Aside from that, player receives a star insignia under his current rank which is used so the experienced players are not confused with newcomers. The number of the stars indicate how many times the player has reached level 70.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2010-01-26T00:00:00-08:00"},"2256":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Obsidian Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"115ec5d2-9ffd-43cd-9794-e6485e5c9686.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4eb443f9-88b9-4348-a54e-a1cef2c9231a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2e596396-5444-438e-983f-e8be5308e8ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9f71194-34a6-4ec4-9459-9bba0054b571.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"25445781-ddbd-45a9-8b36-c252d0aaab9f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alpha Protocol","Overview":"Billed as an \"espionage RPG,\" Alpha Protocol casts you in the role of secret agent Michael Thorton as he embarks on a series of international operations set in Rome, Moscow, Tai Pei, Saudi Arabia, and other exotic locales.

Stealth-oriented spies can complete the entire game without killing an enemy, while destructive types can bring out the body armor and heavy artillery. Action points can be assigned to an assortment of attributes, from stealth and pistols to sabotage and technical aptitude, which all lead to different skills.

Based on a long-running Japanese series, it is the fourth console game in developer Gust's Atelier series to be released in North America, and the first developed for PS3. The game's graphics employ cel-shaded 3D characters and finely detailed 2D backgrounds, to create the effect of playing through a high-definition anime feature. Combat plays out with each character and enemy making its attack in turn. Positioning is not important in the abstract battles, but using the most effective attacks at the right times, against creatures with different elemental strengths or weaknesses, can make a significant difference in a close fight. The game's alchemy interface allows players to combine quest rewards and found objects into tools, armor, and weapons of great power or specific use. The game's ultimate challenge is to create the rarest object in the world - an object perhaps powerful enough to save the realm, or destroy it -- using exceptional ingredients and alchemistic expertise gathered throughout the adventure.

It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\n\nThe game retains Portal‍ '​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\n\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time.","Publisher":"Valve","ReleaseDate":"2011-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JZD17pQSqUU"},"6462":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"a01742e9-383a-477f-9f98-c0ac8719ab32.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e92993c-dc4a-4ea3-bfe8-c83027811d38.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f49b6c11-65ad-455a-a443-9348e0fa64b7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07f2f949-5c35-443a-b887-ff310bacaf49.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d4713d67-1e5d-4739-9c04-965b61cb3617.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6f6467c5-fb00-4231-a384-fdac78420dad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2a56559-83a0-4347-8e15-7dc9c5f119f2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"646ed44a-7c4b-4bed-acd5-e022ff04e2d6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e4331452-7039-4bd9-b7d3-86cd773b23f9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9e9c7b99-dc8d-4139-9d61-b333317aa689.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger","Overview":"The first hi-res 2D fighter from the creators of the Guilty Gear series!

It was released on November 19, 2007 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.\n\nThe cover features Greg Oden, formerly of the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nAlmost every school competing in Division I NCAA college basketball at the time was included in 2K8, including recent additions South Carolina-Upstate, Cal State-Bakersfield and Florida Gulf Coast. Not included were Presbyterian College and North Carolina Central, D-1 independents. Also, Centenary College of the Summit League was unlicensed and instead named UL-Calcutta. The game also featured the ability to change and modify rosters and share them online via the newly introduced 2K Share feature. The real coaches feature was dropped from this game, possibly because the coaches chose not to renew their contracts and all of the coaches are unnamed.\n\nThe announcers\/commentators featured in the game were Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery. The College Hoops series was put on hiatus in 2008 as 2K Sports declined to seek the college license for a 2K9 release. EA Sports got the contract before 2K did, so EA will continue to make college basketball games. EA discontinued their college basketball game series in 2010. It is currently unknown if 2K Sports will continue to make their College Hoops 2K series.","Publisher":"2K Sports","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uBUBUesnFtA"},"6593":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihilistic Software","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9e1f2bb5-8f63-41f4-ba8a-fe1eec442d27.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"31aad990-48b7-4d00-85d3-bd7bf627f32a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb0fb90f-98f1-43bd-9459-f165e6e0ed90.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f3c62d80-c971-4a70-b255-1edb7f4e985b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Conan","Overview":"Conan the Cimmerian, the hero of Robert E. Howard's books, is ready to destroy armies, wage sieges and even battle the ancient gods themselves. Conan's trusty sword will cleanse the earth of ancient evil, using a variety of bone-cleaving moves. He will go through deserts, fight on ships, in ancient catacombs, in palaces and everywhere will his sword triumph over his enemies. Conan is a 3D action game that combines hack-and-slash combat with a pinch of puzzle-solving. Conan can use his bare fists, as well as a variety of one and two-handed weapons, shields, stationary bow turrets and elemental magic, but also interactive environment objects (like boxes and boulders), not to mention, spikes on the walls, to deal with evildoers. Blood and gore follow Conan, when he cleaves into enemy lines with such acrobatic moves as slicing enemy's head clean-off while jumping over him, or pile-diving an enemy into the ground with devastating results. Three weapon styles have over 100 deadly moves, each with its own gory animation. Bonus points can be collected by freeing hidden semi-nude slave women. Conan also has a long list of achievements for hardcore players to set as goals.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-23T00:00:00-07:00"},"6594":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Monolight","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"dde72f28-7728-4a99-8313-40bbba37b192.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4d8ab14c-2740-4652-8ab6-d2fbb984c70e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"20c80f36-09cf-4b15-ac19-8aaa4bb64a0e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"509be31d-ff23-4cd2-aee7-a43937b39c7c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04b77809-7cd6-4e6d-9172-a32162c46f79.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Condemned 2: Bloodshot","Overview":"In Condemned 2: Bloodshot, players will engage in visceral combat using a variety of firearms, blunt instruments and an all-new fighting system complete with defensive and offensive combo chains, as well as grapples and holds.

It was released on October 21, 2008 in North America,[1] October 23, 2008 in Australia,[2] and October 24, 2008 in Europe.[1][3] It was made available on Steam on October 22, 2008.[4] Crytek, the developers of the original game, were not involved in the development of Far Cry 2. It is the second installment of the main Far Cry series; the sequels Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 were released in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nUbisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, however the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a modern-day Central African nation during civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate \"The Jackal\", a notorious gun runner. As of January 23, 2009, the game has sold 2.9 million copies.[5]\n\n\nFar Cry 2 is a sequel to the original Far Cry. The game features an open-ended experience. Players are able to ally with one or multiple factions, and to progress through the game world and missions as they see fit, resulting in a nonlinear style of gameplay commonly referred to as sandbox mode that allows the story to progress at their speed and in the order they choose.[6] Players can use a range of vehicles, including cars, trucks, boats and hang gliders, to travel within the 50 km2 (19 sq mi) gameplay area. The playing styles range from head-on assaults to stealthy infiltrations and assassinations. The game takes place in a sprawling African landscape, with terrain ranging from desert to savannah to jungle.[7]\n\nVarious factions and vehicles are featured; enemies include human mercenaries.[8] There is a dynamic weather system that has a day-night cycle and different weather conditions such as storms and strong winds. The time of day also affects the behavior of AI, in terms of enemy alertness and aggressiveness; for example, an enemy might have a slightly heightened awareness at night, but be unable to see the player in hiding, while during the hot part of the day the enemies might be sitting in the shade in groups but easily spot the player from a distance.\n\nThe health bar represents the health of the protagonist that is divided into five segments, each of which automatically refills if it is not depleted and the player finds cover for a few seconds. Players carry a limited supply of syrettes which can be used at any time to fully replenish the health bar, and are obtainable from first aid boxes located throughout the game world, specifically at guard posts. When nearing death (only one health bar remaining), the character must perform first aid on himself, for example removing bullets with pliers, or snapping twisted or broken fingers into position.","ReleaseDate":"2008-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gf5h4co4Ydc"},"6602":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Monolith","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8ac20a00-3bf6-44be-a4b7-9120a247ec85.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"42efc5f0-b12c-4b15-9839-1e7e4b2f3b6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d6d337e2-c6f2-45df-9b13-fc61f680d988.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fd239fce-0a81-48b1-8e45-608abb48d513.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1918e428-4aa6-4b4e-9c82-43d799599a5b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"00e5e451-0c29-488f-9640-0340c49e61a0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"F.E.A.R.","Overview":"F.E.A.R.™ (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a paranormal action thriller presented entirely in first-person.

It was released on the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 consoles, with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port, Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port, and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. The game was released on June 26, 2008 in Europe, on June 29, 2008 in North America, August 6, 2008 in Australia and October 9, 2008 in Japan. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game-only package.\n\nThe game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series, extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. As with other games in the series, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in-time to scrolling notes on-screen. It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 70% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.\n\nWhile Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.","ReleaseDate":"2008-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=srhn-q6sy40"},"6609":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Neversoft Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"ed59a941-8424-4175-b679-6be786e7fd37.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9ebc4f9-7aa9-40e6-9dad-f8eca0c7bb26.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"65b80f39-0e55-4ef3-a641-4d6fd003d949.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9f683bb8-23f6-4196-bfb1-c6973ba768e0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"664233ca-a0a1-476f-b23c-f688a1ed6db8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"beafe5e9-a33d-4def-b177-f3c95c871fcf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock","Overview":"Rock out to the third entry in in Red Octane's music series for guitar gods!

Herman von Klempt (voiced by Jürgen Prochnow), the Nazi head-in-a-jar, who, unusually, is supplied with a full body in the video game, is the game's main villain, along with several of his 'kriegaffen'. The game has online and offline multiplayer co-op for up to 2 players.\n\nThe game was created under the creative direction of both the comic book's creator, Mike Mignola, and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro.

The antiquated character sprites used over the past 14 years have been dropped in favor of all-new, high-resolution fighters fluidly animating across painstakingly detailed, 100% hand-drawn backgrounds. \n\nThe King of Fighters XII is a pure arcade fighting title. Like a few other releases in its franchise it does not contain a storyline, instead focusing on the tried and true 3-on-3, five round team fighting gameplay mechanic. Far from a liability, the lack of storyline plays into the fighting mechanic by eliminating official teams linked to the prevailing story, which in earlier releases compromised the characters that could be added to a team. In addition, the game also features new combat elements including the \"Critical Counter\" system which opens up the possibility of additional linked attacks and finishing moves when players land effective counter punches following an opponent's attack, and \"Clash Timing,\" a break effect during a bout that separates combatants when they land blows on each other at the exact same time.","Publisher":"Ignition Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sYaMX-8_Gyk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_King_of_Fighters_XII"},"6614":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"LEGO Indiana Jones: La Trilogia Original","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"efa1aa02-b8f4-4514-92b5-ca8c58bb4a64.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2546d2d0-2aac-430d-ab17-491ad87e7906.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ee78c582-d39b-40a2-9f45-4248639873e8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"93df18b9-0b4b-46fc-af8f-1049bdff7594.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"85bc7550-187c-4c0d-bce6-7031d67570d1.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c8a78934-6f05-4b23-badb-0bb7c0063db5.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures","Overview":"Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a 2008 video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts.[7] The game allows players to recreate moments (albeit more humorously) from the first three Indiana Jones films: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).

Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast.\n\nFight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles. \n\nThere are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again.\n\nManipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness.\n\nIn King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins.\n\nThe Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up.

An ideological war is growing between people who accept the biotechnological progress and people who fight it. A human revolution is coming.\n\nAdam Jensen is a thirty-four-year-old ex-SWAT member from Detroit, enrolled by a powerful biotechnology company named Sarif Industries. His job is to ensure the scientists' private security and safeguard the secrets of the company's projects. The first day after his hiring, Adam Jensen is about to attend a meeting with David Sarif, the founder and CEO of Sarif Industries, when suddenly a red alert is issued in the company laboratories. A troop of mercenaries, apparently working for Belltower Associates, breaks in and kills several scientists. After having neutralized some of the mercenaries, Adam is severely injured by one of them. He has no choice but to be enhanced with biomechanical augmentations to save his life. His goal is now to discover what were the motivations of the attackers, and unravel a greater conspiracy behind their actions.\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution is the third game in the Deus Ex series. The events of the game take place in the year 2027, twenty-five years before those described in the first game. Like the first installment, the game is a hybrid of 3D shooter with a stealth angle and role-playing. All styles of play can be adopted to succeed in the missions, from a totally furtive mode (some bonuses are granted in case the player character hasn't been detected during the whole mission), to the most brutal one. The player's decisions may have an impact on the storyline.\n\nThe game offers a vast array of weapons and biomechanical augmentations (hacking, social, stealth, sight, armor or combat skill enhancements, etc.). Various amounts of experience points are awarded for completing main or secondary quests, avoiding or eliminating enemies, hacking, reading electronic books and discovering secret passages. After having accumulated a certain quantity of experience points, the player is awarded a \"praxis kit\", which can be manually used to learn or improve an augmentation. These kits can also be found during exploration or purchased in clinics.\n\nRole-playing elements include, besides augmentations and general character-building, exploration of non-hostile areas and dialogue with non-playable characters. During certain crucial moments the player will have to participate in a \"conversation battle\" with a key character, selecting the correct psychological approach and influencing subsequent plot events.\n\nA few modifications have been made to the shooting gameplay, emphasizing its tactical aspect. Third-person cover system is integrated into otherwise fully first-person gameplay. Enemies often appear in groups led by a commander; taking out the latter may demoralize enemies, making them easier targets. Though the game still contains health-restoring items, the protagonist's health regenerates itself over time.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2011-08-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution"},"8310":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beenox","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"242cc500-3485-4296-85f8-bdfdec0dd5c0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8f73fdf-2049-4454-8b34-00b39c1ebf59.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"28aa87a3-e69e-4682-96d5-4b4b82c3cffc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ecc01f10-bc29-45c2-b041-7d0ee7c165b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"982f000c-15d0-4b7a-ad99-3a5cdcf9971f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f08d3c69-9faf-47ae-a2a3-ec78246751fe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions","Overview":"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is a thrilling action-packed adventure set in four dramatically different universes from legendary Spider-Man lore, each with a distinct Spider-Man armed with unique skills and strengths, in one original storyline.

Everything from the realistic vehicle damage to the way your co-drivers and rivals address you by your real name (providing you forename is relatively common) immerses you in the experience further.\n\nThe graphics are crisp and polished, with the fully licensed vehicles in particular boasting impressive attention detail and eye-popping reflections at the start of each race and, invariably, a thick coating of mud by the end. Environments feature varied backdrops and road surfaces, with landmarks giving a strong sense of identity to each real world location, be it the London Circuit's Battersea Power Station or the Rocky Mountains in Utah.\n\nTopping off the glossy presentation is the soundtrack, which leans heavily towards indie and alternative rock, and features bands old and new, such as White Lies and The Stone Roses. During races, you'll be listening to the roar of engines and context-sensitive chat between your rivals.","Publisher":"Codemasters","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVqkPxykqpA"},"9716":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"fc855e07-ef26-4df6-954b-de940ca6cd21.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cbf58ead-1cef-47f5-a720-8dc71ee40159.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f03a6197-e4de-477d-b923-db4e90fb5aab.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Shaun White Snowboarding","Overview":"Ubisoft brings you the freedom of the mountains with Shaun White Snowboarding for PlayStation 3.

The Predator Technology 2.0 game engine has been updated from the previous WWE games to allow for more fluid animations, with odd collisions and transitions having been fixed and updated, it also allows for over 300 new moves. Past problems have been fixed with a better weight detection system, contextual animations and automatic attack homing, to ensure that the character always strikes towards the enemy. The contextual animation system has been refined to ensure that it dynamically swaps out moves to make sure that the game is using the appropriate move animations at any given time and state. The weight detection system makes it so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show. Thus, the contextual animations ensure that more appropriate attacks are put in the superstar's normal moveset. The game's new homing system is designed that when doing high flying moves, a player will hit the intended target with better precision. The homing system also tracks tables so that they will be better detected when doing grapples on a ladder in TLC and Ladder matches.[4]\n\nThe game is the first to feature Spectacular Moments, also known as \"OMG! Moments.\" This feature allows players to bug the game to make it seem as ring breaks, barricade breaks, announce table breaks, and catching (mid-air) finishers are possible.[5] The Predator Technology engine has been further updated to include an enhanced audio engine, dubbed WWE Live. Instead of chanting pre-recorded in a warehouse as done in previous WWE games, WWE Live features chanting recorded from live WWE events. To make the audio more authentic, WWE Live features more crowd participation, with the crowd's chants, cheering and booing being dependent on the situation occurring in the match. Sounds were recorded by the WWE Production team and THQ from actual live events. Divas matches have also been updated, with up to six Divas, created and original, being able to compete simultaneously in the ring, a feature absent for many years. WWE '13 will also feature WWE Universe 3.0, which was also further updated to allow the player to edit schedules, television shows, rosters, as well as creating alliances or feuds between several wrestlers.\n\nOn September 21, it was confirmed that WWE '13 would contain the I Quit Match for the first time since WWF SmackDown! and the King of The Ring Tournament.[6]","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2012-10-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=arQMM5iyT_o"},"11448":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arkane Studios","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"57527fab-d26c-49d3-91ba-6d14d0340f00.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"df713e1e-0bd7-4b4c-95f4-1eb6444a21de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cf740278-535c-4d0e-9c9a-7b3e09835f83.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e754936e-77e5-4f27-90a3-d050ef8c211f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"02a83a14-28ab-4b3a-82b3-b033496bdf20.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dishonored","Overview":"Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk- inspired technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows.

In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes. In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races. The plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit. Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules. Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy.

A group of American soldiers, which includes the protagonist, Captain Nathaniel Renko, goes to investigate, when another surge disables their helicopter. After they crash land on Katorga-12, Renko begins to phase between the present and 1955, the date of a catastrophic accident on the island. He arrives in 1955 in time to save a scientist named Nikolai Demichev from dying in a fire. As he rescues Demichev, a man tries to warn Renko not to save him; the man is then killed in the fire.\n\nBack in the present, Renko discovers that Demichev has taken over the world. He is captured by Demichev's soldiers, but is rescued by Katheryn, a member of a resistance group called Mir-12. Based on a journal they found on Katorga-12, they believe that Renko can put an end to Demichev's reign using a time manipulation device called the TMD, developed by Victor Barisov. Barisov was killed by Demichev long ago, so Renko uses the TMD to save Barisov.\n\nBack in the present, Renko and Barisov determine that they can set history right by returning to 1955 and destroying Katorga-12 with a bomb made from Element-99, the material that caused the catastrophic accident in 1955. Renko and Katheryn manage to find such a bomb, but Katheryn is lost as they retrieve it. They use the bomb to destroy the island, and thus, the research facility that Demichev used to become so powerful.\n\nBack in the present, Renko finds Demichev holding Barisov at gunpoint. Demichev reveals that he rebuilt the facility after it was destroyed, so that history remained unchanged. Barisov realizes that it was Demichev's rescue that changed history, so he asks Renko to go back and stop his past self from saving Demichev. Demichev, in turn offers Renko a place in his empire in exchange for the TMD. He also points out that Barisov's plan has failed before – the mysterious man who told Renko not to save Demichev in 1955 was Renko himself.\n\nAt this point, the player has a choice. If Renko shoots Demichev, he goes back in time to stop himself from saving Demichev in the first place. In order to do so, he decides to kill his past self. In the epilogue, it is implied that Barisov recovered the TMD and used it to conquer the world himself. If Renko instead shoots Barisov, he and Demichev rule the world together. After some time, Demichev begins to fear Renko's growing power, and a cold war develops between the lands ruled by Renko and those ruled by Demichev. If Renko shoots both Demichev and Barisov, Renko allows the world to fall into chaos. Later, he rises up as a new world leader, using the TMD to assert his power.\n\nA scene then shows a wounded Katheryn, pulled into 1955 by a time distortion, writing the Mir-12 journal which will later be used to track down Renko.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D1i6H04a4A0"},"11938":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Bandai Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c7480283-e7b0-4ee3-ac7d-ae24364b071d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ae7f0bdf-6a49-456c-9932-accd08822d29.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae43f50a-d4c8-4259-ad83-45f7225c6b77.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ff4b9b26-3c43-43d6-9840-d16d9798f79f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"395a2f98-81a8-40c9-8484-8dd274d0d50c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"89afb8ae-75e3-41c7-9d1c-4b235a67d696.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Afro Samurai","Overview":"It is said that the one who becomes \"Number One\" will rule the world, wielding powers akin to a god.

As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater.\n\nRespect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you've been saving for a special occasion.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2008-10-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IusE_qBMRUs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saints_Row_2"},"11969":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"99db035f-cf45-47e6-9313-b899cfec058d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c162421e-785d-4ddd-8cec-382eaa985ed4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Heavy Fire: Afghanistan","Overview":"Stay sharp in this blisteringly fast-paced modern day shooter.

Others would call her a mercenary. For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes.\n\nSimilar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slide across the floor or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how \"stylish\" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat.\n\nBesides the normal combat and the action\/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat their highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points.","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"12007":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Level-5","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"a1d43ffb-3975-4726-8e38-f6cd79f3a44e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e4e08a5b-7016-42b8-9d87-ccd817a52511.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7efa9be4-60aa-4f57-95ff-f5275cd1afa7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"42df315a-c177-44a8-8e9d-143d34a80d39.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2eaf0856-3c53-4a0d-b835-1adee641c98d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"White Knight Chronicles: International Edition","Overview":"White Knight Chronicles: International Edition is a Japanese RPG which allows players to explore an expansive and exciting world of turn-based combat, adventure and comradery.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Solid_HD_Collection"},"12316":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beenox","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"342ffb40-ff9e-4aba-899f-bba442512fc0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a43b201-e7c7-4888-859c-23bdc0914c70.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"53762102-e733-4834-af12-25e5d8c6c0ce.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d102fce1-e582-4ea4-89e2-db91428480e0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Amazing Spider-Man","Overview":"Some months after the events of the film, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp after hours, where Gwen reveals her suspicions that they may be continuing Curt Connors' cross-species experiments.

It is the fourth installment in The Elder Scrolls action fantasy video game series, following The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and preceding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Oblivion was first released in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A mobile phone version of the game was released in May 2006, and a PlayStation 3 version was shipped in March 2007. After a number of smaller content releases, a major expansion pack, Shivering Isles, was distributed. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition (a package including both Shivering Isles and the official expansion pack Knights of the Nine) was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A fifth-anniversary edition was shipped in 2011.\n\nOblivion '​s main story revolves around the player character's efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the \"Mythic Dawn\" that plans to open the gates to a realm called \"Oblivion\". The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. Developers opted for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles.\n\nDevelopment for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind. To design the graphics, Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant A.I. system, which enabled non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game features fully voiced NPCs—a first for the series—and the music of award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Overall, Oblivion was well received by critics, and has won a number of industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Within a month, the game had shipped over 1.7 million copies, and by November 2011, sold over 3.5 million. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide.","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-16T00:00:00-07:00"},"12320":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Creative Assembly","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2db41a50-1b45-4738-a8a2-f4ca0d85e8a5.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6ad87683-5f89-4c1d-82c9-ec5478ca390a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"896d5255-1bb6-4691-88cc-dcd71a6529f4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cff4b2e0-dc5c-4bcc-af40-3d43d4c00bff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Viking: Battle for Asgard","Overview":"Viking: Battle for Asgard thrusts players into a twisted mythological world overrun with demonic warriors unleashed by Hel, the Norse goddess of death.

The inspiration for the game comes from two distinct types of events: Demolition Derby and Banger Racing. A demolition derby is more of an American pastime, primarily at state fairs and the like. Participants take an old beat down car, strip it of all the glass and other \"dangerous\" elements, spray paint the car and decorate it to their liking, then beat it to death at the main event. The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the \"figure 8\" shaped course is a staple of the race. No matter whether it's Banger races or demolition derbys, the fact is that everyone love to see the everyman take it to the mat and come out a victor, and that's what Mayhem is all about.","Publisher":"Rombax Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-25T00:00:00-07:00"},"12322":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rebellion Developments","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"82ae541b-7cb8-4f75-aa5c-39a2f9b2498a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"85208766-2cef-46ad-9c19-f9855b46ca53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fccc6be8-cdac-436c-a71f-5dab934c620c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"NeverDead","Overview":"NEVERDEAD begins in the waking hours of peace and calm, when the world is under threat of being consumed by a demonic plague.

As ever, they'll do anything and everything the Overlord commands of them, especially now that they can run ravage and wreck buildings and scenery. They've also learned how to ride: In Overlord II Minions mount up and ride wolves and other magical creatures around the landscape and take them into battle, making our band of merry fighters faster and fiercer than ever before.","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g6fqAKD2DGA"},"12360":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Omega Force","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"43480875-2745-47a4-b876-31a9b807801b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2eb34e24-aa99-42a3-9c45-adaa613fb3d4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"810d94d1-218e-4691-95ca-f1954e8d9840.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Dynasty Warriors 7","Overview":"In the new Story Mode, follow the ascent and fall of heroes.

The Purge system is a key element, as it allows Reyvateils to use their high-level song magic. However, 'purging' also has importance for the Vanguard characters, as it allows them to use their best attacks.","Publisher":"NIS America","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8HcBMDB9N4g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ar_Tonelico_Qoga"},"12393":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"99fb0332-a138-4564-aead-a84167755715.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"32b37be4-699c-4dc5-bb01-9efd359a3e5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Assassin's Creed Ezio Trilogy","Overview":"This compilation of the Assassin's Creed games contains all three games where Ezio Auditore is the main character.

Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on October 18, 2011, with a Microsoft Windows version following on November 22.\n\nWritten by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini with Paul Crocker and Sefton Hill, Arkham City is based on the franchise's long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman is incarcerated in Arkham City, a huge new super-prison enclosing the decaying urban slums of fictional Gotham City. He must uncover the secret behind the sinister scheme, \"Protocol 10\", orchestrated by the facility's warden, Hugo Strange. The game's leading characters are predominantly voiced by actors from the DC Animated Universe, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in both combat and exploration. Arkham City expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim, particularly for its narrative, character and world designs, soundtrack, and Batman's combat and navigation abilities. It was tied for the highest-rated video game of 2011 according to review aggregator Metacritic, and was the recipient of several awards including: Game of the Year, Best Action Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Adventure Game, and Best Original Score from various media outlets, and it is considered one of the best games ever made. Arkham City was followed by several additional releases: a spin-off mobile game, Batman: Arkham City Lockdown, on December 7, 2011; a Game of the Year edition containing all of the game's downloadable content on May 29, 2012; and Wii U and OS X versions in November and December 2012, respectively. A successor, Batman: Arkham Origins, was released in October 2013, and a narrative sequel, Batman: Arkham Knight, was released in June 2015.","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-29T00:00:00-07:00"},"12400":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bainarī Domein","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ryu ga Gotoku Studio","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"6e2fde8d-a953-4125-8974-0dab198c3338.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1cc96b22-7cb2-4774-8fb5-a4c8409f4428.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"53780a7c-65b2-42e9-9af6-53ed4f4e672e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6d5e7fd7-a33c-4caf-b736-3f24fead3b94.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"67efd0ac-e165-40a6-b97b-ee1e65238dd9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d752ff8c-93b4-428e-a4fc-86a2da8141a9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"780bb8d9-dc12-48aa-871c-9409d4dc494f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Binary Domain","Overview":"Designed by Yakuza-creator Toshihiro Nagoshi, Binary Domain is a futuristic squad-based shooter that pits humans against robots in 2080 Tokyo.

As such, the game isn't considered canon within the Dead Rising continuity. It also changes the plot of Dead Rising 2 significantly in regards to the different characters and their motives.\n\nAfter surviving the zombie outbreak that occurred in Willamette (though now infected with the zombie virus), freelance photojournalist Frank West quickly became a celebrity for exposing the truth behind the outbreak. However, his fame soon vanished due to frequent scandals and controversies. In hopes to regain a place in the spotlight, he accepts an offer from Tyrone \"TK\" King to appear as a special guest on the controversial pay-per-view zombie-killing show Terror is Reality, taking place in Fortune City, Nevada.\n\nAt the beginning of the event, Frank, wearing a wrestling outfit, is lifted via platform into a wrestling ring and made to kill zombies. After the event is finished, a humiliated Frank takes his winnings and leaves. As he is leaving, he overhears TK talking with someone and goes to investigate. With his camera, Frank manages to take some pictures of TK handing money and a strange item to a young man, though a few of TK's thugs attack him when he tries to escape. Frank then calls the elevator to leave, but a loud tremor knocks him out.\n\nWhen Frank wakes up, he finds that the zombies have gotten loose and are now infesting Fortune City. Frank fights through the undead hordes to the emergency shelter. Security chief Raymond Sullivan initially refuses Frank due to his infection, but Frank bluffs his way in with an empty box of the anti-zombification drug Zombrex. He then meets Stacey Forsythe, who leads her branch of the protest group CURE (Citizens for Undead Rights and Equality) and had been in Fortune City to protest Terror is Reality's zombie-exploitation when the outbreak began. After helping Frank find a dose of Zombrex, Stacey monitors Fortune City from the Safe House and informs him of any new developments or signs of survivors. In three days, the military will arrive to rescue them all.\n\nA news report appears on the Safe House television, and reporter Rebecca Chang runs footage of TK's accomplice placing a bomb on the zombie holding pens. Stacey recognizes him as Brandon, a member of CURE, and her group is blamed for starting the outbreak. Frank goes out to meet Rebecca and the two of them search a security room in the Arena, which has been sabotaged and destroyed. Back in the Safe House, Stacey spots Brandon hiding in a bathroom. He has gone insane, and Frank is forced to fight him to the death.\n\nFrank confronts Stacey about how Brandon was part of CURE and how he started the outbreak. Stacey responds that he was new and TK must have planted him in the group. They continue to argue until Frank notices people moving equipment in the underground on a security camera. Moving through the underground tunnels and fighting off guards, Frank confronts TK. The gameshow host admits that he is indeed behind the outbreak before escaping. TK's men then begin robbing Fortune City's casinos, though Frank stops the attempted heist.\n\nRebecca invites Frank to come with her and meet her source. Frank arrives, but finds nothing except a transceiver. TK talks to Frank on the other line, demanding that he bring $1,000,000 to the Shoal Nightclub or Rebecca dies. Frank arrives with the money and is confronted by her \"source\" Amber and Crystal, TK's twin girlfriends and bodyguards. He manages to kill one of them, and the other woman commits suicide out of grief. Rebecca and Frank chase TK to the roof of the hotel, where he is preparing to escape Fortune City on helicopter. Frank foils the escape and captures TK, who is held prisoner at the Safe House.\n\nBy this time, the military has arrived in Fortune City to begin the cleanup and rescue. At first, the soldiers have little trouble with the zombies. However, a strange green gas begins rising from the vents in the ground. This causes some of the zombies to mutate, becoming faster, stronger, and seemingly unkillable. No match for the \"gas zombies\", the military team is nearly wiped out. The sergeant in charge of the team escapes the zombies, and Rebecca follows. Frank heads to the underground, and finds the sergeant has gone completely insane and is holding Rebecca hostage.\n\nAfter defeating the sergeant, Frank gets Rebecca back to the Safe House. TK refuses to say anything about the gas. When asked why he framed CURE, he says that Brandon was just the name \"they\" gave him. The Safe House doors are suddenly breached, allowing zombies to flood inside. Frank manages to hotwire the inner doors to close, but he realizes that the breach wasn't an accident, Nearby, TK tries to escape but is knocked over by a zombie and bitten. Enjoying the irony but needing him alive for his story, Frank contemplates on whether he should give TK a dose of Zombrex. He ultimately does so despite TK's ungrateful insults.\n\nThe television news reports that since no survivors were found in Fortune City, the military will commence a firebombing to wipe out all the zombies. Realizing that TK could not plant such false news, Frank heads to the underground tunnels to find the source of the gas. He finds a secret base of scientists and soldiers harvesting zombies for Queens, the bee-like parasites responsible for the zombie virus, and grabs a laptop containing classified information from the pharmaceutical corporation Phenotrans, which also produces Zombrex. After studying the information, Rebecca concludes that Phenotrans started the outbreak and created the gas zombies to both produce and drive up demand for Zombrex. She also attempts to call her news station to send helicopters for the survivors.\n\nRebecca is suddenly shot and Frank turns to face her shooter... Stacey. Sullivan stops her from killing Frank, but he is shot dead and Stacey escapes. Frank chases her into Fortune Park, where Phenotrans soldiers are continuing to harvest Queens from the zombies and storing them in giant machines. After destroying the harvesters, Frank goes to Uranus Zone to confront Stacey, who is actually a Phenotrans agent codenamed \"Agent S\". Stacey boasts that Phenotrans didn't start the outbreak for money, but to save lives. She explains that they need Queens to make Zombrex and therefore need to make more zombies to produce them. Stacey calls it \"a necessary sacrifice for our country\", but TK's actions (getting CURE on television and robbing the city) were carried out without her permission. She then turns on a giant robot and attempts to kill Frank, but he is able to destroy it and Stacey is killed when the robot collapses on her. Frank then uses her phone to call Rebecca's news station and demand helicopters for the survivors.\n\nThe station sends a convoy of news helicopters to evacuate the Safe House, and Frank helps the survivors board. Before the last helicopter leaves, Frank leaves to get TK, but finds that he has vanished from the Safe House along with Rebecca (who is still alive but badly wounded). TK calls Frank on his transceiver and tells him to prepare for \"Overtime\". Frank is made to travel through Fortune City and gather various items for TK. When he arrives at the Arena to deliver the items, TK knocks Frank out with a taser. Frank wakes up and finds himself in the zombie wrestling ring again, and he fights them off as TK taunts him from the rafters. Rebecca manages to crawl to a switch and lower a winch for Frank to climb, where he confronts TK and eventually throws the evil host down to the ground below. Frank takes Rebecca and carries her out of the Arena, and a zombie jumps out for one final scare.","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-11T00:00:00-07:00"},"12409":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Ichi Software","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c218d8cf-e7c3-4808-93ea-b1bede08a31f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"618dd21a-4bf3-4e8f-853f-ac276bbeb22b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c99cf73a-2f28-4aba-95bb-27ab4c69cf45.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9089929a-f1a0-437c-8bb9-5fbe09b8eb29.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7a3eac76-6908-422e-ad27-41846d623bec.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3a8410bb-b2e2-4601-8534-c20c019a42ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e9607349-dcd5-40df-97ba-7d9a051a8905.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d67cdf8b-1749-48f8-a11b-e2bb14726eb2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten","Overview":"The next installment in this popular hardcore SRPG series is back!

It was released on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on Microsoft Windows. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Set within the fictional Liberty City (based on New York City), the single-player story follows a war veteran, Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.[c] Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. Following its announcement in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated.[4] Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00"},"12422":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Chōjigen Geimu Neputyūnu mk2","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Idea Factory","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"072d9f05-ebce-470a-9e11-cb147182481c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d3a54eec-1e8d-4f5b-8d61-821390fd3917.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1515b10d-1b8d-42bb-b38d-24d0ccb8bda2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2","Overview":"Peril in Gamindustri!

The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghast Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Helghan War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces. Captain Jan Templar, the main protagonist, and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the ISA operative Hakha and the key in his possession. During the course of the game, Templar meets other characters who assist him such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.\n\nKillzone 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009. Killzone 2 follows the events of Killzone and Killzone: Liberation, and is set entirely on the planet Helghan, the home-world of the Helghast who invaded an Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony. Two years after the Helghast assault on Vekta, the ISA has launched an assault on the enemy's homeworld of Helghan. The ISA goal is to capture the Helghast leader, Scolar Visari and bring the Helghast war machine to a halt. The main protagonists is Sergeant Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko, a battle-hardened veteran of the special forces unit the \"Legion\" assigned to Alpha team, who go on a mission to take out the Helghast threat. Captain Jan Templar has been promoted to Colonel and is the Fleet Commander of the New Sun, a Cruiser airship set up in the clouds of Helghan over its capital city, Pyrrhus, preparing for a final attack. During the invasion of Helghan, Sev's unit is deployed behind enemy lines to assist the main invasion force. Tasked with securing the enemy capital of Pyrrhus, Helghan's first true city, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are a more formidable enemy on their home planet. Not only have they adjusted to Helghan's hostile conditions, they have also harnessed the power of the freakish lightning storms that always occur on Helghan which they can now use against the ISA. A cold, barren, unforgiving world, Helghan provides a ready defense with thick, acidic air, dust clouds, and violent surgical lightning storms. Sev discovers his squad is not just fighting enemy forces—their fiercest opponent may be the planet itself.\n\nKillzone 3 was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2011 and is the only game in the series to feature a special edition, support the PlayStation Move, and utilize 3D gaming. It immediately follows the events of Killzone 2. Visari, the leader of the Helghast is gone, but the war is far from over. Helghast forces have mounted a devastating counterattack, prompting the ISA (Interplanetary Strategic Alliance) evacuation of planet Helghan. As new Helghast battalions appear, armed with more powerful weapons, ISA forces find themselves outmanned, outgunned and surrounded. Two new antagonists appear, Jorhan Stahl and Admiral Orlock, who both want to become the new Autarch of Helghan. Sev returns as the protagonist with Rico and Narville. Admiral Orlock eventually becomes the new Autarch due to a circumstantial decision by the Helghan High Council. In a final confrontation between Stahl and Orlock, Stahl murders Orlock, however, the planet Helghan and Stahls ship is nuked by Sev and his team. However, it revealed that a ship crash landed on Helghan and is greeted by two Helghan soldiers.","Publisher":"SCEA","ReleaseDate":"2012-10-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"12428":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile Heart","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"8b5c212f-fe36-4ac3-9aef-1e1ede96cc17.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9889b4da-01af-44d0-ba26-270d0da705e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Mugen Souls","Overview":"Mugen Souls (圧倒的遊戯 ムゲンソウルズ Attōteki Yūgi Mugen Souruzu?) is an RPG developed by Compile Heart with collaboration from GCREST and published in North America and the PAL regions by NIS America.

Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. An OS X port was developed and published by Feral Interactive in 2013. It is the first video game based on both J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation released in 2001 (The Fellowship of the Ring), 2002 (The Two Towers) and 2003 (The Return of the King). This is because, until 2009, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to make games based on Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema films. In 2009, WB Games acquired the rights for both intellectual properties.\n\nThe game contains narrative elements unique to both the novel and the films, although the aesthetic design is based more specifically upon the look of the films, with characters in the game bearing the likenesses of the actors who portrayed them in the films. The game does not directly adapt the story depicted in the novel and films, but instead depicts a trio of adventurers whose quest runs parallel to the main narrative, occasionally intersecting with it. The story follows them as they attempt to track down and defeat a powerful Black Númenórean named Agandaûr, who Sauron has employed to lay waste to the northern regions of Middle-earth, whilst Sauron himself concentrates on Rohan and Gondor.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews, with critics praising the graphics and tone, but criticizing the repetitive combat, weak storyline and poor character development. It was also criticized for containing several game-breaking bugs. War in the North was a commercial failure, a fact many critics attributed to the timing of its release - several weeks after Dark Souls, on the same day as Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and ten days prior to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.","Publisher":"Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"12459":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"6509f769-187d-4bfb-b384-cca1ed1998d7.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"44d0854e-53c8-4a9b-8d48-a71470adfb61.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bd1d39ff-0ced-4275-bbb7-24d7d7240a90.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d0680872-9081-40c0-bad7-abac69689b79.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6d4a76e2-b9ea-4ff9-9251-6574c389913f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f3143b62-eb6c-4dd9-92b4-a23a45b2f27c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6e091512-69d7-47f6-81fb-52831e5855f5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Trilogy","Overview":"Experience the first three titles of the original action-packed Splinter Cell franchise, now digitally re-mastered in High Definition.

Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players compete against their team's opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element that could only exist in the twisted Resident Evil universe. The result is a brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With a cover-up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of the mysterious outbreak.

It contains a total of 6 sporting events that can be played either alone or with up to three friends. The events are:\nDisc Golf - The goal of this game is to accurately throw a disc into a glowing pillar laying somewhere around the course. As the name implies this event is very similar to the game of golf, yet instead of swinging a golf club you are throwing a disc. The move controller detects everything from the angle of the disc to the power of your throw.\n\nGladiator Duel - In this event you go one-on-one against an opponent in an epic duel. Armed with a sword and shield your goal is to completely lower you opponents health before they do the same to you or before time runs out. Properly blocking fills up a special meter that once filled allows you to unleash a powerful combo attack. This can be played with either one or two motion controllers.\n\nArchery - In this event you have to reach behind your back, grab an arrow, and fire away. The move controller allows you to feel like an archer and practice your accuracy skills. This can be played with either one or two motion controllers.\n\nBeach Volleyball - In volleyball you get to control your characters actions but not it's movement. You have no saying on where your on-screen character can move, though at points you will have to do things like move the controller a certain way to make your character dive across the sand. This event is all about having perfect timing and placement with your partner in setting the ball and striking.\n\nBocce - In this event two players take turns throwing balls across a field trying to get it to land next to another ball. The player who lands their balls closer wins the round. Knowing tricks like twisting your arm and spinning the ball will help you to get the ball to where you want it.\n\nTable Tennis - Table tennis is all about controlling a paddle to send a ball back and forth between players. It is like the sport of tennis except that it is played on a small table and uses paddles instead of rackets. The precision of the Move controller allows you to do moves like spins, lobs, and strikes very accurately. The goal of this game is to earn points by making your opponent miss your shots or send theirs out of bounds.\nEach event contains a Champions Cup Mode. In Champions Cup Mode you must go against 10 opponents in increasing level of difficulties. Before you start the event you get to choose which character that you have unlocked to play with. There are three cups: bronze, silver, and gold, with gold being the most challenging. Having a quick time in events and not losing a lot of points allows you to earn up to three stars in each match. Having good scores allows you to gain trophies and also unlock things like new courses, clothing, items, and characters. There is also a Challenge Mode where you can play certain challenges to increase your score and a Free Play mode which you can play for fun with friends or just practice your skills.","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-17T00:00:00-07:00"},"12969":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ryu ga Gotoku 5: Yume Kanaeshi Mono","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Ryū ga Gotoku 5: Yume Kanaeshi Mono","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ryu ga Gotoku Studio","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"400230ac-cab5-4b9a-b3c5-fcf79cfaf8f7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f1b7660b-8d4c-458c-96a5-6942650c7f10.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea2dd191-f299-4688-8b21-b0f136531ed7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b643350-c78d-4f37-ad79-e550dcdc5dbf.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a17a423-001f-408b-85d2-6dcca203564a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3b39d413-050d-4fba-85d1-238d58697ad1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"24fb54e6-9c4a-4bfc-967e-6bad4790a681.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a1b8e5a4-f4c0-4b24-bff8-bcba529c1f6d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"25dd0415-0dfc-48cb-894b-7b7a4d525c43.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2680890f-ea91-4f62-bc31-61446f7cc0b3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0333a6e9-9c8a-4fd2-86ff-9edbf08f2dd3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yakuza 5","Overview":"The game is the fifth main entry in the Yakuza series of action-adventure games.

As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket. \n\nHe finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, and with them, makes it to Isenstadt.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ujycthb4B8E"},"13031":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Relentless Software Ltd","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"0976cac0-1bef-44a6-b350-b495c34b3af9.png","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Buzz!

But one day the seeds of conflict rained from the sky and the entity known as The Dark, tried to take all the power for himself. The Light and The Dark battle fiercely but The Light couldn't defeat The Dark and stop the chaos. They were both inseparably connected to one another and so The Light realized that the only way to stop The Dark was to banish him and himself into two cursed artifacts. Each one is now guarding the artifact containing the powers of the other and all seems well. At least until one day a egocentric treasure hunter named Ayumi finds the map to the hidden temple where the artifacts are guarded.\n\nIn her greed she ignores the warnings of The Light, touches the artifact and by doing so unleashes The Curse upon herself. It enters her body and condemns her to pain and suffering. But not all is lost. The Curse hasn't full control over her yet. Withstanding it, Ayumi continues to search her search for the second artifact. But now not because of greed but to battle The Dark, confine it's powers again and relieve herself of The Curse by doing so.\n\nThe journey is not an easy one as the player takes over the control of Ayumi, looking over her shoulder and guiding her through the levels. The return of The Dark spawned many enemies on the island. But as an experienced treasure hunter, Ayumi isn't defenseless. With her gunblades in her hands, she mows through the enemies like Dante does in the Devil May Cry series until the entrance to the next level unlocks. Each defeated enemy then drops one or more souls which Ayumi needs to buy additional skills, spells and items allowing her to cast fireballs upon her enemies or buy more powerful bullets for the gunblades. This is especially important as all the enemies and bosses have different weaknesses. The phantoms e.g. are immune to physical damage but hitting them with a fireball or fire-induced blades will destroy them in no time.\n\nScattered around the temple are also artifacts which were broken into three pieces.

It is the first game in the Dragon Age franchise. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 3, 2009, and for Mac OS X on December 21, 2009.\n\nSet in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a warrior, mage or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background who must unite the kingdom to fight an impending invasion by demonic forces. BioWare described the game as a spiritual successor to their previous Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. The game is played from a third-person perspective that can be shifted to top-down perspective. Throughout the game, players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and accompany the player throughout the game.\n\nBioWare described Dragon Age: Origins as a \"dark heroic fantasy\" set in a unique world. Its setting was inspired by The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice & Fire, and was described by BioWare as a mix between high fantasy and low fantasy. Development of the game began in 2002, and lasted over six years. BioWare employed more than 144 voice-actors, and hired Inon Zur to compose the game's music.\n\nOrigins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system. It sold more than 3.2 million copies, and 1 million pieces of downloadable content. Its multiple year-end accolades included Game of the Year and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications. BioWare released an expansion pack for the game titled Awakening in March 2010, and two sequels, Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Inquisition, were released in 2011 and 2014 respectively.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1\tGameplay\n2\tSynopsis\n2.1\tSetting\n2.2\tCharacters\n2.3\tPlot\n3\tDevelopment\n3.1\tDesign\n3.2\tSound\n3.3\tRelease\n3.4\tDownloadable content\n4\tReception\n4.1\tCritical reception\n4.2\tSales\n4.3\tAccolades\n5\tFranchise\n6\tReferences\n7\tExternal links","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Age:_Origins"},"13056":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"9373f96b-3de8-4ede-b78e-b33a66db8659.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Dark Souls: Collector's Edition","ReleaseDate":"2011-09-15T00:00:00-07:00"},"13067":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Canada","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"658e96e1-a43f-4548-8578-9239711d56b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d31f7b0c-91a7-4941-b7a4-82e352e6a4d8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2846423a-9b37-4c7f-8e51-0dbccd1944cd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4e0e565-6b12-40c6-90aa-e15bb0984bba.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2102454-ff31-4424-a291-c32313f455cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"596b78d4-2937-429c-baeb-b108e79b401a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"EA Sports Active 2","Overview":"EA SPORTS Active 2.0 provides total body conditioning using progressive exercise in new prescribed programs.

The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick.[7]\n\nJust like in NHL 12, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 13.[8]\n\nThis year, for the first time, two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero have been added.[9] In NHL 12, users could create female characters, but there were no real-life players.[10]\n\nOn September 20, Gamesindustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history.[11]","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00-07:00"},"13223":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rockstar North","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"55879226-61dd-41b4-a8ee-1a6d0781074c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8934ea6-d266-4ac3-a72d-24dd1cf488af.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c0c04f37-bd55-485f-b767-573ec122ba15.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7463e02-6207-44f3-9bce-a5cee71f7467.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45393210-feae-4467-aea9-74cf34cdfdb0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3db4a46d-0f84-4d4f-a880-9ada8e725e45.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City","Overview":"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV.

The new venues take place along a coast, on a mountain range, in the woods, and across a desert. The shot system by default forgoes the horizontal power meter in favor of a swing-based approach in which players use visual cues to time their backswings and follow-throughs. Traditionalists can still, however, revert back to the old swing system from the options menu.\n\nOnce again a number of customization features are available to personalize each of the game's 15 characters and six caddies. By competing in different events, players can unlock new equipment such as enhanced clubs and balls. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds also includes a robust online component, with the ability to create custom tournaments supporting up to 50 players. Online avatars can be tweaked with 300 visual options, including hairstyles, masks, clothing, and more. Players can also send messages to friends, or visit the PlayStation Store to purchase new courses, clubs, characters, and other features. Key play modes include Versus, Training, Tournament, Stroke, and Match Play. Detailed statistics are tracked throughout each mode and challenge, from best average score and driving distance to average putt length and putting accuracy.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertaiment","ReleaseDate":"2008-03-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Everybody%27s_Golf_5"},"13349":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Darkworks","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"01b9b7c3-6068-4cd7-9415-0b2c049d8382.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6af69171-bb3d-4d94-9d77-a9188fb1b026.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d302d256-8d94-46f1-b2cf-59d46551dc95.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1436b1f1-47a9-4c6d-bd1f-61ec2783c33a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"I Am Alive","Overview":"Chicago, June 2009.

It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series, in which players can simulate the playing of rock music by using controllers shaped like musical instruments. The Beatles: Rock Band is the first band-centric game in the series, and it is centered on the popular English rock group the Beatles. The game features virtual portrayals of the four band members performing the songs throughout the band's history, including depictions of some of their famous live performances, as well as a number of \"dreamscape\" sequences for songs from the Abbey Road Studios recording sessions during the group's studio years. The game's soundtrack consists of 45 Beatles songs; additional songs and albums by the Beatles were made available for the game as downloadable content.[1]\n\nThe game was released internationally on 9 September 2009, coinciding with the release of new, remastered compact disc versions of the Beatles' albums. It incorporates many of the gameplay features of the Rock Band series; however, it is not an expansion pack for the Rock Band series and content for it and other Rock Band titles is not cross-compatible. Harmonix co-founder Alex Rigopulos described the game as \"... a new, full game title production built from the ground up.\"[2] Gameplay mechanics differ slightly from previous Rock Band games, including the addition of a three-part vocal harmony system. Subsequent games in the Rock Band series would reuse these new elements, including vocal harmonies.\n\nThe game was developed with the blessing and critical input of Apple Corps, including former Beatles Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, who both made public appearances supporting the game. George Harrison's son Dhani helped to bridge discussion between Harmonix and Apple Corps, while Giles Martin, son of the Beatles' music producer George Martin, ensured high-fidelity versions of the Beatles' songs would be available.\n\nThe Beatles: Rock Band was well received by the press, both as a genuine means of experiencing the music and history of the Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with more than half a million units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bpBDOolcs9g"},"13396":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b273a45e-8442-4958-a18c-345f1321dd0a.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"43c7d34e-1330-433a-92f9-8ebefcc72c52.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2c78d3ae-99e0-449a-b0f5-bdcf9768ed4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"11eaaa88-1f81-4403-b97b-5c0319029005.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"88fc3ea0-6b43-477a-a192-12d30eb4c9db.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7d423f85-28cf-416f-83eb-37bc0cc33558.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars","Overview":"Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars is similar to the previous titles in the series.

Players are tasked with navigating their character through city streets, while avoiding the vampire enemies that patrol the streets disguised as ordinary human citizens. Players often have to take alternate routes, such as climbing onto rooftops or through alleys, to avoid enemy encounters.\n\nUnlike most stealth-action games, Vampire Rain places heavy emphasis on pure stealth. Enemies are extremely fast and can kill the player in two hits; the first hit usually immobilizes the player, giving the vampire sufficient time to land a second, killing blow. Additionally, for the first third of the game, players lack any weaponry that can kill vampires effectively without spending a large amount of ammunition. In effect, most attempts to initiate combat generally result in the player's death. Also, unlike most stealth games, there is usually no effective means to hide or escape once an enemy has spotted the player, which results in the player dying soon after being spotted. Successful completion of many missions thus generally requires total avoidance of enemies by figuring out the correct route to pass through the mission area without being detected.\n\nLater in the game, players are given high-powered weapons which prove more effective against the game's vampire enemies. Also, there are a few pre-scripted action sequences that involve fighting against multiple enemies, generally with the assistance of teammates or special environmental hazards. The player's arsenal includes a handgun, submachine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, anti-armor rifle and a UV Knife used to stab an enemy from behind for an instant kill.\n\nIf the player collects enough \"Medals\" that are either placed in hidden or difficult to reach spots throughout the game as well as passing certain missions under certain conditions such as within a time-limit, without needing to retry from a checkpoint or without killing any Nightwalkers will reward the player with extra side-missions and challenges.\n\nOnline multiplayer involves up to eight players in standard modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag, as well as the unique mode which allows one to become a nightwalker and fight opponents with extreme speed and power. All the firearms are available online and the gameplay is handled like in single-player.","Publisher":"Ignition Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2008-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13432":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"00d1a25c-0147-49fb-b09b-5e6ba517f5fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"105f1939-6d53-42e2-ad7e-7daab4f6317f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Stormrise","Overview":"Stormrise is a real-time tactics video game developed by The Creative Assembly's Australian studio and published by Sega for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-24T00:00:00-07:00"},"13435":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Double Helix Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"efe8e6e4-94b7-43de-b836-4db6fd36493d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"738cbe9b-4173-4dd2-b462-66f256bd478c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Front Mission Evolved","Overview":"The plot of Front Mission Evolved revolves around USN engineer Dylan Ramsey.

New skate fans can learn the ins and outs of skateboarding with the all-new Skate.School - a place to practice and hone their skills on the sticks before hitting the streets with their team. SKATE 3 delivers all the camaraderie and competition of skateboarding. New tricks, improved off board actions, and gnarly Hall of Meat carnage mixed with exciting new team-based gameplay takes SKATE 3 to a new level of skateboarding fun.\n\nIn contrast with the original Skate, two new difficulty levels have been added: \"Easy\" and \"Hardcore\" modes. \"Easy Mode\" allows the player to perform tricks easier and provides greater control of the character. \"Hardcore Mode\" attempts a closer simulation of skateboarding and the player must perform tricks precisely. The game also features an introductory \"Skate School\", where Coach Frank (Jason Lee) teaches players the basics of skateboarding, such as grinding and performing ollies. This feature is optional and the area can also be visited for unrestricted skateboarding.\n\nSimilar to the Tony Hawk games, Skate features a \"Skate Park\" that allows players to build custom skate parks.\n\nEA introduced three new online game modes: \"1-Up\", \"Domination\", and \"Own The Lot\". In \"1-Up\", players compete in turns to beat the other team's last score in a given time period. In \"Domination\", teams compete to gain the most points on set spots in an area within a time limit.

The video game's storyline fills in some gaps as to what exactly took place during this frantic dimension-hopping. The various dimensions our heroes pass through contain a number of references to certain episodes of the TV show that were not referenced in the movie. Two players can co-op play at the same time, or a single player can work with a computer-controlled partner. The game plays like a typical platformer with numerous puzzles, mini-games and boss battles in-between exploring and fighting basic enemies. There are countless items to collect and special characters (each with their own unique ability) to unlock as well as costumes\/skins that can be obtained for all of the playable characters. Once more than the two main characters are unlocked, players can switch characters between levels if they so choose. Weapons can be customized with different colors and sound effects once these are earned\/unlocked. Additionally, there are many achievements\/trophies to be won and an increased difficulty mode becomes available after achieving the final trophy. Background props change depending on what time of the year the game is played (e.g. jack-o-lanterns are visible around Halloween, snowmen and Christmas lights appear in December, etc). This game should not be confused with the DS game that has the same title, but is otherwise a completely different game with an alternate plot line, other types of weapons, dimension levels and boss battles unrelated to the Wii and PS3 versions.","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios","ReleaseDate":"2011-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13479":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Images":[{"FileName":"3f5873b5-394a-4042-842f-079b6e5633c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9f05c8d-5de4-484a-b006-b26d09f358f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"33b84a8c-4c43-4df6-b4dc-7f0b0f54d751.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Michael Jackson: The Experience","Overview":"After enjoying chart-topping success on Wii, Ubisoft's Michael Jackson: The Experience moonwalks over to the motion-sensing Kinect and PlayStation Move peripherals.

The land once more faced with war; a war that was much larger, and more far reaching consequences than all previous wars and battles. Two thousand years before Shaddar the cry for heroes arises to avert this war and to regain control over the T Energy. Will those heroes prevent the world lapsing into final chaos, or will they instead deepen it with their actions?","Publisher":"Cdv Software Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-05-12T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OmEyohOPh8M"},"13488":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Irrational Games","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"15d64fbb-6751-4bb0-a38a-4f68ae032025.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a7e8741c-4914-439a-880b-f23adae93a8c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"45616734-6297-4d39-aa3b-4780c1fcf3de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eaa0ae0f-c2de-450f-b2ab-9206f9a39e6b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6bbbb1be-8fed-44c2-b3a4-dd7496db2905.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"814ae368-16e8-4033-a948-9c3015562d9f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"673188a7-ad4d-4a40-9450-ae8fa1327c45.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BioShock Infinite","Overview":"BioShock® Infinite is a first-person shooter like you’ve never seen.

It is derived from the The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and borrows many gameplay mechanics from Pandemic's Star Wars: Battlefront games. The game allows the player to play as both the forces of good and evil, but unlike The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, the latter option is based around Sauron stopping the One Ring from being destroyed and using it to regain his lost power.[2] On December 23, 2008, the PlayStation 3 demo was made available on the PlayStation Network[5] while the Xbox 360 demo was released January 2, 2009.[6]\n\nPandemic was aided by Weta Digital in developing the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy novel, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened if they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.[2]\n\nOn March 16, 2010, the online multiplayer modes of The Lord of the Rings: Conquest were shut down for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[7] On August 16, 2010 a group of fans launched the non-profit CNQReboot servers, allowing users of the PC version to play online using tunnelling software that allows network play via the local area network option.[8]","Publisher":"Electrionic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-01-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13621":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"95c3b735-02f6-472e-bc75-e5d2214669e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e510192c-5c06-493a-a321-add36ebfd279.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"NBA Live 10","Overview":"Elevate your game to the highest level with NBA LIVE 10, the most complete NBA basketball experience.

Lead soldiers, warriors and fellow swords for hire into battle on horseback or on foot, fighting alongside Joan of Arc or the King of England as you strive to become the mercenary champion and gain fame and fortune during these dark times.\n\nThe gameplay takes place in a 3rd-person perspective and takes the form of an action \/ RPG of sorts. The 'central hub' of the game is a local bar where the player attempts to find jobs that will increase his or her wealth and reputation, as well as dealers that will allow the player to change weaponry or buy more troops to fight alongside them. This hub area also serves as a meeting place for characters from the game world and the player may gleam information from gossip heard that will help them later in-game. Talking to the barman within will present a roster of missions available, the length of that particular campaign and the reward for success - these can take place on either the English or French side (you cannot ally with just one faction). Selecting one of these missions will take you to the battlefield.\n\nThe main game itself is broken down into what first appears to be a strategy sort of game in which the player is shown which territories they have to take to successfully complete the mission - however any strategic element ends here. They can then select which 'home camp' to start from. Once this is chosen they are presented with a battlefield (similar in respects to dynasty warriors). The main objective is to make their way to the castle \/ village to be taken and successfully seize it from the occupying troops. battling with any enemy troops they encounter along the way.\n\nThe player can command a number of differing types of combatants, from archers to footsoldiers to horseback, and later on in-game camel and elephant riders. Battles are a simple hack and slash affair, with the player attempting to clear the area of enemy troops. Once this has been achieved a base commander will appear at the base under siege. Beat this commander and the player will have seized the territory and completed the mission. Extra fame can be achieved from beating in combat the VIP enemies found throughout the mission. This in turn will also yield treasure for the player, some of which is collectible throughout the game.\n\nAs such, Bladestorm has no end - the player will continue to fight battles as they progress (This is after all the Hundred Years' War!), but there is a story arc within the game to be completed, and the amount of missions - although very similar can give players a lot game content to keep them happy.","Publisher":"KOEI Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bladestorm:_The_Hundred_Years'_War"},"13886":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Koei\/Omega Force","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Fighting; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"78e16ce2-bbb7-4653-9416-2c21f0e600e7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a1b35dd-2a04-425d-84a9-b473f83d9e21.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae3b6978-2a9d-4294-a076-eb4c4fedad5d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f113a2d4-9cf2-41e2-ad2b-f1967839fec6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"55c3148a-4c2e-405e-ac28-93ea63909e94.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3f21d42c-04b6-48e0-8e55-65300cda69b4.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3867168b-ab03-4983-b89e-edca042a9d84.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d9507b4f-c8e0-4163-9319-1f5b5e4d6e2b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7868018a-0d03-4245-a240-7fc4f4ff07ef.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"abf0c0ad-6f66-4835-9a88-8edeccdffb2e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2","Overview":"Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 combines the devastating power of the mobile suit, the rich legacy of the anime Gundam universe, and the furious tactical action gameplay of the Dynasty Warriors series.

Sony Online Entertainment's stated goal is to make a different kind of MMORPG, with The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction cited as one of the main inspirations for gameplay. SOE is working to make DC Universe Online more interactive than standard MMORPGs, while trying to keep their key elements, which include a leveling system, raid instances, endgame progression and inventories. The world is mainly shared, public space instead of heroes or villains owning territory. The public space features dynamically-generated content designed for both hero and villain player characters (uniquely created by the player, who cannot choose DCU stalwarts).\n\nPlayers will choose a mentor for their character (Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman for heroes and Lex Luthor, Joker, or Circe for villains). Their starting location, principal quest rewards and mob loot will be influenced by that decision. The starting zones are either Metropolis or Gotham City, for both heroes and villains. Heroes can also go to the Justice League Watchtower, while villains can enter the Secret Society of Super Villains headquarters at the Hall of Doom. Other safe-houses in the Gotham and Metropolis zones can be reached by teleporters from the two faction headquarters or from the two cities. For the heroes, it's various police stations. For the villains, it's various nightclubs owned by the villains.\n\nEach character is given a communicator appropriate to their faction, via which they receive urgent communications from their mentor and his\/her colleagues and subordinates; heroes will frequently receive status updates from Oracle, while villains will receive data from Calculator. In addition to assignments from their mentor, player characters may also receive requests for help from other mentors of the same faction. Player characters may also accept missions from non-player characters (NPCs) in the street, usually minor characters from their faction. There are also opportunities for quick street encounters appropriate to the character's faction: for example, a hero character may encounter a thug robbing an armored truck, trying to break into an office building, or in the process of mugging a citizen; while a villain character may be presented with opportunities to assist NPC thugs with an armored truck robbery, or assault a citizen using an ATM. All NPC interactions are fully animated and voice-acted. Player characters will earn threat ratings that will cause NPC heroes and villains to interact accordingly with the character.\n\nThe shared worldspace offers primarily solo and team player versus environment (PvE) gaming opportunities in the form of open air missions and instances, although player versus player (PvP) combat is also possible in this worldspace. Other PvP (and to a smaller extent, PvE) gaming is available in various types of queued instanced encounters: \"Legends\", small scale PvP combats in which players take on the identities of iconic characters (continued success in Legends combat unlocks additional iconic characters); \"Arena\", small scale PvP combat in which players fight as their own characters; \"Alerts\", cooperative team missions; and \"Raids\", Cooperative PvE missions that are larger than Alerts. Success in PvE missions is rewarded with in-game money, costume pieces, equipment and consumables, while PVP combat is rewarded with unlocks of special equipment sets.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment \/ WB Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-11T00:00:00-08:00"},"14374":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Neversoft Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Life Simulation; Music","Images":[{"FileName":"f001671d-e7dc-4fc4-b476-95b62fbf0e86.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"36208b70-124c-415f-b719-b167f327207a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Guitar Hero: Metallica","Overview":"\"Ride the Lightning\" with musical icons Metallica and over 20 other rocking acts in Guitar Hero: Metallica.\n\nJust as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was something of a glorified expansion of Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: Metallica serves as an extension of Activision's band-focused hit Guitar Hero: World Tour, offering gamers a feel for life in and around one of heavy metal's most popular and influential bands. The game features a total of 49 songs, including 28 original Metallica tracks, such as \"Seek and Destroy,\" \"Fade to Black,\" \"Master of Puppets,\" and \"One,\" and 21 band-selected songs from such acts as Bob Seger, Judas Priest, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. In general, the game's difficulty level was designed to be on par with that of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, however, the hard-hitting nature of some of Metallica's tracks led to the creation of an extremely difficult \"Expert+\" mode that can incorporate a second drum pedal.\n\nThough band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo participated in motion-capture sessions to help create lifelike in-game avatars, the story actually finds players in the shoes of a band serving as Metallica's opening act. This narrative mechanic sends gamers to such real-world music venues as the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, the Forum in Los Angeles, the Hammersmith Odeon in London, and the Tushino Airfield in Russia. As always, players must earn high scores and unlock new songs by rhythmically matching onscreen prompts that correspond with musical notes. The music creation aspect of World Tour returns in Guitar Hero: Metallica, with new musical tones based on Hetfield's guitar and a new \"Drum Over\" mode that lets gamers play improvised drum tracks over any song, while the multiplayer \"Battle Mode\" comes equipped with new Metallica-themed power-ups such as \"Fade to Black,\" \"Ride the Lightning,\" and \"Trapped Under Ice.\"","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-29T00:00:00-07:00"},"14377":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Neversoft Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Life Simulation; Music","Images":[{"FileName":"5fd43330-f40e-4a9c-92f1-3839a74c3465.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45660e17-9e62-4827-9f00-ee13d120ab7f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock","Overview":"Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock features more than 90 tracks that include guitar shredding hits from bands such as Black Sabbath, Megadeth and Slipknot and larger than life anthems from Queen, Muse and KISS.\n\nThe sixth full title in the original play-along rock & roll series, Warriors of Rock takes Guitar Hero virtual virtuosos on a journey of metal-inspired fantasy. In the game's Quest mode, players lead eight individual characters to transform into heroic warriors, in a realm of studded black leather and dark gothic undertones. Characters use their individual special abilities to complete rock performance challenges and move the story forward, toward an ultimate battle that will determine the fate of the Demigod of Rock, and indeed, rock & roll itself.\n\nWarriors of Rock hits retail shelves with the largest out-of-the-box playlist yet in the Guitar Hero series, boasting a total of more than 90 tracks from artists including Black Sabbath, Kiss, Megadeth, Anthrax, Def Leppard, and Soundgarden.

Up to four players (human or CPU controlled) control a character and fight on a multi-tiered 2D stage. Players may use various items that appear randomly to get the fighting edge over their opponent. Additionally, the stage may use set elements in order to take out other players. For example, in the Dexter's Lab Stage players can pull 2 different levers, one setting off a conveyor belt, and the other firing a deadly laser.\n\nWhen players strike one another, glowing cubes will fall out of them. If players collect enough of these cubes, they will fill up their special meter that, when full, unleashes a powerful \"Punch Time Explosion\" (the equivalent of a Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) attack against their opponents. For example, Ben turns into one of his aliens and launches missiles all over the stage.\n\nIn the XL version, fighting characters can team up with certain assist characters (the equivalents of Assist Trophies) and do Synergy attacks. For example, Madame Foster brings a plate of cookies to the arena, Chowder eats them, turning fat, and Madame Foster rolls him around the stage.\n\nEach character has their own special move set that uses different elements from their respective shows. Each has an up, down, and side attack. Most characters have a projectile attack.

Completing challenges is also rewarded with new equipment, clothing, characters and additional challenges.\n\nThere are two different paths to follow: Skateboard Mag and Trasher, both with the aim to get coverage in different magazines. The Skateboard Mag path follows a more formal career skater format, where progress through the path relies on completing photo moments, demos, contests and filming parts. The Thrasher is more of an anti-authority path, with downhill races, and screwing with security. By completing either path the player gets access to the Xgames, and the mega-ramp, which is a gigantic ramp based on a real construction.\n\nUnlike the Tony Hawk series, movement and tricks are entirely controlled through the analog sticks.\n\nskate.reel and the in-game replay editor allow players to go back at any time and look over there last 15-25 seconds of gameplay and view it from multiple angles.

It once again stars three characters – Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight – who need to work together and use their complimentary skills to progress through levels filled with enemies and physics-based puzzles. The game picks up the story when the trine is rediscovered and brings the three characters back together. It transports them to an unknown world where their progress is overlooked by a mysterious figure referred to as The Witch. Later in the game her true identity and purposes are revealed. The story further involves the Goblin King and his minions, as well as the tale of two sisters who are also princesses.\n\nJust like in the first game players can freely switch between the three characters to tackle the environment-based challenges. The knight is strong and most suited for close combat, the thief is agile and has long-ranged attacks, and the wizard is a feeble character that uses magic to manipulate items. Many of the original abilities are still present. The wizard creates boxes and planks as temporary platforms, the thief uses grapple to cross large gaps, and the knight is able to deflect projectiles with his shield. New abilities are unlocked through a skill tree shared by the characters, and some of the new options allow the wizard to chuck opponents around or for the thief to upgrade her arrows with new enhancements. Skill points are earned by locating vials. There is no longer an inventory with items gathered from treasure chests for additional upgrades. Instead the chests yield poetry that reveal bits of the story.\n\nThe game can be played cooperatively with three players each controlling a character simultaneously. This can be done both offline and, new for this sequel, online. When a character dies, it can be revived at the next checkpoint. There are two new gameplay modes that are available right away. There is Game+ that allows players to go through the game again with their fully upgraded characters from the start. The second one is called Unlimited Character Mode and it allows players to assemble a party of any combination of characters, for instance using just three thieves.

The game utilizes both third and first-person perspectives. In third person, the player controls Stranger when travelling long distance, platform jumping, rope climbing and melee combat while first person is like that of first person shooter games where ranged weapons are used. Enemies can be approached head on like a straight up action game or stealthily by hiding in long grass out of enemy sight (as indicated via mini map) and luring foes away from or toward the player.[9] Once enemies are encountered, they can be killed or knocked down\/stunned temporarily; in this state they can be captured, thus earning more moolah than if they had been captured dead.[10] Upon an attempted capture, Stranger is unable to perform other actions and thus is vulnerable. The player has two status bars, health and stamina. When damage is taken, the health bar drops; if it fully depletes, it will result in the death of Stranger. Stamina drops when the player performs actions like melee attacks or falls from a great height. While it refills itself over time, it can be used to shake off health-bar damage, thus healing the player, but draining the stamina quicker.[9]\nOne of the game's main features is Stranger's crossbow that is used in a first person perspective that uses live ammunition in the form of using small fictional versions of real creatures as projectiles for differing effects. Live ammunition can be bought from the game's vendors or found scattered throughout the game world. When acquired, two different kinds of ammo can be assigned to the crossbow at any given time for two kinds of firing attack.[3] There are nine critters in total that can be used as ammo, such as Stunkz for stunning large groups of enemies, Thudslugs that work as cannonballs, Boombats that work as rockets, and Bees that are fired at foes like an automatic rifle.[3]\nThe game incorporates many role-playing elements in the form of earning moolah with each bounty fulfilled allowing it to be spent on upgrades such as crossbow, ammunition, storage and armour upgrades and other items such as binoculars and knuckle dusters.[11]","Publisher":"Oddworld Inhabitants","ReleaseDate":"2011-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15044":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sanzaru Games","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b1e8ddf4-23be-4181-9fe2-8a9c1ed97b03.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"19a33263-1695-4472-839f-d28c41afe290.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7bcb668c-3460-49d2-a5ae-9bc4d40d21d7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c36ba76a-efe5-48e8-8c81-a4230f5dd550.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fe7fc10f-b234-4f0e-834e-584a85309677.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ffd10f69-d4fe-4c02-a372-3fb7e0c509fa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c47e3553-4f76-496b-9382-e4b20b0e40da.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e3aa5497-434e-407c-b9d2-a424ec5d6e9f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time","Overview":"Sly Cooper Thieves in Time continues to chronicle the adventures of the Sly Cooper gang from where Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves concluded.

The game introduces Raiden as the central character; a child soldier transformed into a half-man, half-machine cyborg ninja, equipped with a high-frequency katana blade and a soul fueled by revenge.\n\nIn the near future, cyborg technology has become commonplace throughout society. Three years have passed since the collapse of the Patriots system that had been secretly controlling the global power balance from the shadows. However, peace remains elusive. The dissemination of cybernetic technology has triggered instability and conflict as those who control the trade gain increasing power. Furthermore, large 'Private Military Companies', or PMC's, that had been supported and controlled by the Patriots have collapsed, spawning countless rogue entities with origins to larger criminal organizations. These renegade PMCs employing cyborg technology have become increasingly more disruptive shifting policy and power at will. As a member of the peace-keeping PMC 'Maverick Security', Raiden lives by the mantra of protecting and saving lives. But as the world plunges further into asymmetric warfare, the only path that leads him forward is rooted in resolving his past, and carving through anything that stands in his way.","Publisher":"Konami Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2013-02-19T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4oSwMx9xiEI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance"},"15076":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gearbox Software","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"c344ed72-faec-4b42-88b5-4aa316d35cb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f2d849fe-f25d-4daa-8c27-f506a0614f79.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Aliens: Colonial Marines","Overview":"In Aliens: Colonial Marines, players are part of a United States Colonial Marine squad and must prepare to face an alien assault more intense and horrific than ever before.

At the start of the game they are together in a train as Lana escorts her to a hospital after she is busted out of a shady research facility. The train suddenly derails and they end up in a dark and hostile environment. The game is played from a third-person perspective and the main goal is to make sure Lana keeps Amy out of harm's way. The creatures send out an infection, but Amy has an immunizing aura that prevents Lana from being infected as long as she keeps close. Therefore she walks around holding the girl's hand most of the game and they often need to sneak past hazards together. Lana is however also able to take out enemies with melee combat mechanics using sticks and crowbars, but in many situations that is not an option due to the number of opponents. Weapons also degrade over time. When Lana lets go of Amy, the infection gradually sets in and it causes the contamination sensor on her back to turn from green to yellow and red. It turns her skin pale and renders her vision hazy, but at certain points in the game it is necessary to sneak past creatures who then think she is one of their own.\n\nAs Amy's survival is vital for Lana, in many locations she is able to make her hide in closets or other spots when danger is lurking. The options to hide appear automatically when a viable location is nearby. Lana can also hide together with the girl or just by herself. All other control over Amy is also indirect. Lana can ask her to stay in a fixed place, call her to come over, make her turn on a lamp, or ask her to interact with an object in the environment. Amy has to hack into computers, crawl through small grates to access rooms, stand on elevators, and push buttons. There are also locks that can only be opened by collecting a specific DNA sample. These interactions are used extensively for environment-based puzzles. Later in the game Amy gets access to two psychic powers she can call upon; sending out a bubble that knocks down an opponent and a field that silences everything inside. These are activated by having Amy draw a glyph at specific locations around levels. The game consists of six chapters and saving is done automatically through checkpoints.","Publisher":"Lexis Numerique","ReleaseDate":"2012-01-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8-so0EZupSw"},"15207":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"Playboys!

The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the Western United States and Mexico, primarily by horseback and on foot. Hordes of zombies traverse the world, often attacking towns. Gunfights emphasize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic called \"Dead Eye\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. Two gameplay modes were added to Red Dead Redemption‍ '​s online multiplayer mode upon release of Undead Nightmare, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nUpon its release, Undead Nightmare received generally positive reviews. It won year-end accolades, including Best DLC awards from several gaming publications. A Game of the Year Edition, bundling the game with Red Dead Redemption and all additional content, was released in October 2011.","Publisher":"Rockstar Games","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Di2eOr-kqs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Red_Dead_Redemption"},"15270":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Harmonix","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"3a69aa62-a6bb-4f52-ad35-286405ad60a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6f795b0-0591-4f90-b7df-10afc26d0889.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e6a0f8f4-f964-4370-bb9e-2bfef7330d6e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"AC\/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack","Overview":"AC\/DC LIVE: Rock Band features the master recordings from the best of the band's live performances.

The tracks are set in a desert environment and there's over 1000 miles of route to explore. In the main career mode, the idea is to start at the bottom class of off-road racing with a VW Beetle. By performing well in races, players earn prize & sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.\n\nThere are five different race modes; circuit which is a standard race where you do a few laps of a track against opponents, rally which a point to point time-trial, hill climb which as it suggests is drive up a steep hill, and then back down, open class where different categories of car race against each other with a handicap system in place to disadvantage the more powerful ones and Baja which is an endurance race lasting between 250-1000 miles. The Baja mode races can last up to several hours.","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-22T00:00:00-07:00"},"15299":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"75804991-aa85-4d0f-adee-a91f02040cb9.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"59854c0e-76aa-4a84-9e5f-64b2843046cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dec398e2-618f-4be1-889b-17ffe03496da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43f54cb1-f70d-4403-8053-95b0e547f61d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Beijing 2008","Overview":"Game modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics.

Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.\n\nJonathan Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in game development. He funded the three-year project with his own money. Webcomic artist David Hellman drew the artwork, which underwent several iterations until it satisfied Blow's vision. A preliminary version of Braid without the final artwork won the \"Innovation in Game Design\" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival; the final version received additional accolades. The game received highly positive reviews from critics, eventually becoming the highest critically rated title on Xbox Live. Some reviewers, however, criticized the game's price relative to its length.\n\nBraid has been seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development since its 2008 release, and Jonathan Blow and its production was documented in the film Indie Game: The Movie.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-12T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Braid_(video_game)"},"15331":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"a68ba83c-9cd9-4a18-b65d-3e245f83169a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"185f3e49-2d56-4f7c-9a03-7a37bfb17a44.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Brain Challenge Deluxe","Overview":"Released in Europe in 2008 and for the PSN in 2009.","ReleaseDate":"2008-12-05T00:00:00-08:00"},"15332":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"doublesix","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"89bc2ca5-80a0-4de0-9b89-184b1e3eab7d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ce417d9f-37ab-4442-9630-bfc6be332a15.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d9c52f93-75e9-4b44-92e7-e315c7c25be7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4fe0a911-c723-4571-9cc6-115172684003.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Burn Zombie Burn!","Overview":"Burn, Zombie Burn! is a downloadable game for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows developed by Doublesix.

It was developed by Spike and published by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game consoles throughout North America, while everywhere else it would be published under the Bandai label. It was released in Japan, North America, Europe, and Australia during the second week of November 2009. In Europe, a limited edition pack of the game was also released that included bonus collector material.\n\nThe game is a cel-shaded 3D fighter that allows players to play as characters within the Dragon Ball universe, either against the game's AI or another player in one of the various modes of play both on and offline. The game is one of the first games in the Dragon Ball franchise to be published by Namco Bandai in North America, as the company would acquire the gaming license from previous license holder Atari in July of that same year.\n\nThe game was met with mixed reviews from gaming critics for its storymode and overall gameplay controls.\n\nThe game featured mode called Dragon Battle Collection allows players to play through the original events of the Dragon Ball story, but their actions in battle can change the story in many different ways. Over 100 \"Battle Frames\" can be selected at any time, regardless of chronological order to which they appear in the series. The story spans from the Saiyan Saga up until the Kid Buu Saga. Battle Frames also include \"what-if\" scenarios that never occurred in the series. Players can practice and hone their skills in the \"Dojo\". Players can also partake in the \"Super Battle Trial\" single-player modes. The online mode features a 16-player \"Budokai Tournament\", single or team battle VS, and a spectator mode where players can rate the fighters.\n\nNew combination moves can now be utilized, allowing two characters to launch special attacks. There are also brand new environmental features such as new advanced interactions with the grounds of the battlefield.

Half-Blood Prince features a day-night cycle, allowing players to sneak out after sundown and complete missions that might raise suspicion in the light of day. In addition to duels with students from other Hogwarts houses, players will face off against dangerous opponents such as Death Eaters and Inferi. As Gryffindor's star seeker, players will also compete for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. Following the story of the book, mini-games allow players to try their hand at mixing potions, using recipes from the old, annotated textbook of the mysterious Half Blood Prince.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6BQhXZIjlGY"},"15479":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Media Molecule","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Adventure; Platform; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"276f4e85-f3b7-4f6e-9107-d855c2ee8e66.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4cd0705d-5406-465b-afa0-57a8700110ad.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d32e8f3a-f8d7-4902-b361-8d0ee880e73b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a2ca92cf-0e84-41c9-98ac-232f95e42a47.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d2d6dc1-70ed-4e1f-822f-5d74e1447d89.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dec3ebdf-9736-4869-a1bc-eb07b907d3ba.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3a8df9df-caf6-463f-a739-228b1c9a081d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9d36c140-e4e7-4a46-af4c-fe6c1932d527.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"83438a94-92cd-457d-bf05-474f54ed4bf8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"LittleBigPlanet 2","Overview":"Since its release on PlayStation 3 in October 2008, LittleBigPlanet has been credited with establishing the Play, Create, Share creative gaming genre by putting the powers of creation firmly in the players' hands.

The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.\n\nEat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious \"comeback\" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"","Publisher":"D3 Publisher","ReleaseDate":"2009-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eat_Lead:_The_Return_of_Matt_Hazard"},"15504":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"846fa99c-cc9d-468f-9f21-9b91fb073125.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e20d718-3fe6-4def-b6bb-65d195dacc36.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2fd9ba60-bbab-46df-8573-3ea96e116362.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f1e40c4-812d-41d9-b4a4-ad1033a50d42.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Echochrome ii","Overview":"The original echochrome was a mind-bending puzzler that used the player's perspective to manipulate the game world, spinning and turning the world's camera in order to open up new pathways and lead the game’s character from point A to point B.

The PSP version of EyePet was released on 2 November 2010.\n\nThe game uses the camera to allow a virtual pet to interact with people and objects in the real world. Using augmented reality, the simian, gremlin-like creature appears to be aware of its environment and surroundings and reacts to them accordingly. The player can place objects in front of the animal and the game will interpret what the object is and respond to it.[7] For example, if the player rolls a ball towards it, it will jump out of the way to avoid being hurt. It will also react to the player's actions and sound allowing the user to, for example, tickle the animal or clap their hands to startle it. A trailer shown at E3 2009 shows the pet being customized with outfits and colored fur and interacting with virtual objects including a trampoline and bubble machine. The trailers also demonstrate users drawing custom objects (first trailer shows a car, E3 2009 trailer shows an airplane) which are scanned by the camera and converted to virtual objects which the pet can then interact with. The pet can also be fed, as in the trailers, it is shown eating cookies and a type of pet food.[8]","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-17T00:00:00-07:00"},"15509":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"da3353dc-33cb-4386-91bb-c1bc68ac018f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"44c30185-b882-4a06-babc-648819bb798a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efed33f1-268e-4499-8098-f6d1a6e8bfe8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"FaceBreaker","Overview":"FaceBreaker is one part Fight Night, two parts Ready 2 Rumble Boxing from the N64 era. EA has combined a simple high and low jab system with an A+Waggle special punch, as well as a tilt-based charge system for your regular jabs, turning a flick of the nunchuk or Wii-mote into a full-on power punch instead of a quick tap of the face. As you'd expect, the nunchuk controls your player's left hand, while the Wii-mote acts as his right. The game plays exactly how it does on the other next-gen systems, having punches thrown at an alarming rate with no sense of stamina, though a smarter opponent will make use of the Z button (block) and the punch charging to catch their opponent's attack, and deliver a devastating counter-punch that leaves them out of the fight for a second or so. Other than that, it's all about beating the ever-loving hell out of your enemy, building up a small power gauge at the bottom of the screen, and holding the A button while swinging the Wii-mote to deliver different types of haymaker punches based on the level of power you've acquired. Fill the gauge all the way up, and a successful hit will result in a FaceBreaker, which is an automatic knock-out for the fight.

Based on the 1978 film Grease (which itself is based on the 1971 musical of the same name), the game requires either PlayStation Move or Xbox Kinect. The game also includes 20 songs, 15 of which are from the original movie.[1] It is the second game to be based on Grease, following 2010's Grease, which was partially created by the same developer. The title's standard mode is \"Dance\" which has players mimicking motions that appear on the screen to music using either a PlayStation Move or Kinect (depending on the console). Only 15 of the game's 20 songs are available to dance to.[2] In multiplayer, players may complete head to head or perform a coop dance routine. One competitive mode exclusive to multiplayer is \"Challenge\", which has players performing a dance routine while also completing small tasks throughout the song, such as freezing in place for a set number of time.[3] Also available is Karaoke, which allows players to use a USB microphone or the built in mics on the PlayStation Eye or Kinect to sing the song as it plays. Up to eight players may play at once using \"Party mode\", in which two teams consisting of two singers and two dancers face off against each other. In all modes, players can earn a score multiplier by completing five or more pages with an \"Ok\" or higher rating, which increases the amount of points earned for a move.[4] Players can also unlock film clips and mini-games based on movie scenes to play, most of which don't involve the core aspect of dancing or singing. For example, the \"Thunder Road Race\" mini-game is a race course in which players use hand gestures to boost and steer their car in a head to head race with the computer.[2]","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-25T00:00:00-07:00"},"15606":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"93ec3f9f-61d1-42c0-8093-2a02e6f69656.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9a7dd84d-3fba-4e2b-a9ca-4513dc623b81.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fcce6537-bbbf-437e-bb25-1f249a59232d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4dc99316-cf78-4fc8-bac1-63b862075470.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Green Day: Rock Band","Overview":"Green Day: Rock Band is a music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in\/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"15619":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"3ffd8aa8-3a8c-40e3-bfa2-dd4784ca132a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a50a7f56-b95d-4b32-b778-06562f3cb18b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Guitar Hero: Smash Hits","Overview":"Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) is a music rhythm game and the fourth expansion game to the Guitar Hero series.

Co-operative play allows the second player to play as the first player's sidekick character. For example, if the first player selects Jak as their character, the second player will automatically be assigned Daxter.[3]\n\nThe five weapon classes are Disc, Whip, Bowling, Projectile, and Melee. The disc is thrown in a similar fashion to a frisbee; once thrown, players navigate it around the level remotely using the Move controller to achieve objectives, for example to hit moving targets. The whip is controlled by the Move controller via 1 to 1 movement. Bowling acts similar to the disc: the player throws the bowling ball and subsequently guides it with the Move controller. Projectiles involve the use of mainly guns as well as other weapons such as grenade launchers. Melee uses each character's iconic weapons — Sly's cane, Ratchet's wrench, and Jak's gunstaff — to hit enemies in a fashion similar to their original games.[3]","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-22T00:00:00-07:00"},"15661":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"6e052e85-27dc-4a11-b6a8-86f61da8b6f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Heroes Over Europe","Overview":"Heroes Over Europe, the sequel to Heroes of the Pacific, is a WWII arcade flying game set in the skies over Western Europe.

The game's story (written by comics writer Matt Fraction) takes place after the film and sees Tony \"Iron Man\" Stark and James \"War Machine\" Rhodes team up to defeat a coalition of American and Russian terrorists that plan on duplicating Tony's technology for their own sinister purposes, resulting in versions of the comic villains Crimson Dynamo and Ultimo.\n\nThe game is a third-person action game consisting of eight missions. Players control both Iron Man and War Machine - some levels predetermine which character is controlled, others allow players to select. Both characters differ in their abilities: Iron Man is more agile and has energy weapons, while War Machine has better armor and relies on ballistic weapons. Both also have a unique power usable only once per mission: Iron Man can become invincible while War Machine can boost the power of his weapons, both only for a limited time. The levels throw a multitude of enemies at the two, including drones, robots, tanks and helicopters. They can be fought on the ground or in flight, with both ranged weapons and melee attacks. Several of the levels include defense scenarios, like preventing drones from accessing the Stark Archives or escorting a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopters.\n\nCompleting levels unlocks several different versions of the Iron Man suit (including several designs from the comics) for use in further missions and awards field data points. The points can be used in Stark headquarters to research new equipment, including ammunition types, close combat fighting styles, weapons and various power-up modules that increase firing rate or damage dealt.\n\nThe game features voiced cut-scenes and in-mission dialogue, for which actors Don Cheadle (as War Machine) and Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury) reprise their roles from the film, with other parts filled by veteran voice actors. The game's soundtrack mostly consists of metal tracks, with American band Lamb of God contributing an exclusive new song","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2010-05-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15691":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3c0c4e67-2e1c-4d63-9fa1-294b06de3d85.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d0852932-ce6f-4eac-a20c-fe0551ca4b5f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b9c943a5-3643-4085-a480-0f7ceab2f26e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Iron Sky Invasion","Overview":"Released in Europe in 2012.","ReleaseDate":"2012-12-12T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15704":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"e2b81fa7-0c12-4c5f-b613-42f389f18176.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc043f41-bd99-4567-a517-e50388a32a20.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters","Overview":"JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters is an arcade styled flight simulator developed by Trickstar Games and published by Maximum Family Games.

It is part of the Tomb Raider series, but unlike previous games, the game does not carry the Tomb Raider brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay. In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec. They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke. A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following or helping Lara.\n\nIn the United States and United Kingdom, Guardian of Light was released for the Xbox Live Arcade on 18 August 2010; it was released a month later on 28 September for PlayStation Network and Steam. Though local cooperative was available at the initial release for all versions, online cooperative was later added. In North America, on 16 December 2010, the video game was released for iOS devices which included cooperative with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth options. The first downloadable content (DLC) map pack was released for free for a limited time.\n\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light was well received by critics. The Xbox 360 version of the game holds an average score of 85\/100 and 86.36% on the game aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. In September 2010, IGN listed Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light fourteenth in their top twenty-five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time. Critics felt that the game was an excellent fit for Lara Croft.[2] Guardian of Light sold 98,000 copies on Xbox Live in its first six weeks,[3] and as of 22 August 2013, the game has sold more than 1 million copies on all platforms.[4] A sequel titled Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris was released in 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[5]","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VJlLXv8w54o"},"15751":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"e016241e-75a3-47b2-ba1f-5a972e74dda9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"27c07c6b-f828-4e5a-9929-00a7d5bf8719.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5d7eebef-d496-4341-8c5b-0d069827da5b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Le Tour de France","Overview":"Le Tour de France is a cycling game which, unsurprisingly, covers the most prominent professional cycling tour; the Tour de France.

The rider, who takes one of the typical cycling roles, does automatically move forward and the player only gently steers into the general direction and controls speed changes (breaking and attacking). However, energy management is of the most importance - trying to get a fast lead is useless when the rider is exhausted after half of the stage. There is also the option to communicate with other athletes from the same team in order to coordinate tactical maneuvers.

The resulting pandemonium finds players controlling Deckard through the midst of a three-sided conflict between rival secret societies and beasts such as werewolves, minotaurs, gryphons, and golems. The Council of 98 and the Black Order both seek the power of Pandora's box for different reasons, while the monsters attack everyone and wreak havoc on the destructible environments. Having been marked with The Signet, denoting that only he can re-seal Pandora's box, Deckard must travel from New York to London, and on to Durham, England, to restore peace to the world. The Signet allows him to draw health from fallen creatures and perform an attack that repels all nearby foes, but he must rely on grabbing ammunition from dead soldiers, and his weapons are standard pistols, shotguns, and rifles. Multiplayer modes include a standard four-on-four deathmatch, with players controlling the Black Order or the Council of 98 while the creatures lurk hungrily in the background, and a hunting mode that lets gamers try to kill as many creatures as possible within a given time limit.","ReleaseDate":"2008-10-31T00:00:00-07:00"},"15759":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Images":[{"FileName":"d14c3c22-54c5-4a38-8ca3-5584c45d4ad8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43511f40-01c3-4f1f-aef4-74389b87012f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"LEGO Rock Band","Overview":"Lego Rock Band is a music video game, part of the Rock Band series developed by Harmonix, that incorporates elements from Lego video games developed by Traveller's Tales.

Players are able to export the songs from the game into other Rock Band titles, while downloadable content that passes family-friendly filters can be incorporated into the game; however, songs released after Rock Band 3 are not compatible due to changes in the song format.[2]\n\nLego Rock Band was met with moderate reviews, which praised the inclusion of both the Rock Band and Lego video game aspects incorporated into the game, but questioned some selections on the game's soundtrack and some features that would be at odds with the target audience of the game.","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00"},"15762":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"497f87b3-abba-4884-953a-39434ec7bdb9.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"30fdde17-002b-4774-87e9-53b05413c685.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb6191fd-3e1b-4fbf-be62-3a892cacc98a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Lemmings","Overview":"Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphized lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.","ReleaseDate":"2006-12-07T00:00:00-08:00"},"15764":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lightning Fish Games","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"c06afdab-b5c7-4500-81d0-e02a28b11570.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ebdd7cdc-0999-49cf-be4b-55f5c12fbdca.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c69f909-b1c6-4944-ab63-285920a87065.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Let's Dance with Mel B","Overview":"The ultimate dance party has begun!

Previously announced as Metro 2034,[2] the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length.\n\nInitially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012;[3] it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver.\n\nMetro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.","ReleaseDate":"2013-05-14T00:00:00-07:00"},"15884":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"cde4af08-47ee-470f-8d8f-a12fd4b46f76.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a8b90257-2479-483f-afc8-f50813b48d80.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d3ca00b5-5c15-4bc5-abef-190a7823d92b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"MicroBot","Overview":"MicroBot is a twin-stick shooter video game developed by Naked Sky Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts.

Tomb Raider is the fourth title developed by Crystal Dynamics in the Tomb Raider franchise. As the first entry in a new Tomb Raider continuity, the game is a reboot that emphasises the reconstructed origins of the culturally influential lead character Lara Croft.[4][5] Tomb Raider was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 23 January 2014 for OS X.\n\nCrystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider: Underworld in 2008. Rather than a sequel, the team decided to completely reboot the series, establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time, following Tomb Raider: Legend. Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai, an island from which Lara, who is untested and not yet the battle-hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series, must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult. Gameplay elements focus more on survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. It is also the first game in the series to have multiplayer and the first game to be published by Square Enix, after the latter's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009. Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010, replacing Keeley Hawes.\n\nAfter a delayed release from late 2012 to March 2013, Tomb Raider received much anticipation and hype. Upon release, the game was well received, with critics praising the graphics, the gameplay, Luddington's performance as Lara, and Lara's characterization and development, although the addition of the multiplayer mode was criticised. Tomb Raider sold one million copies within 48 hours of its release, and has sold more than 8.5 million copies as of April 2015, making it the best-selling Tomb Raider title to date. An updated version, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, was released in North America on 28 January 2014 and in Europe on 31 January 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing all features and DLC. A sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, was released in November 2015.","ReleaseDate":"2013-03-05T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xIIERnqUpnM"},"15977":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"M - Mature","Images":[{"FileName":"34229121-a4ff-4965-9463-00a5896f1fd8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Tomb Raider Survival\/Collector's Edition","Overview":"This collector's edition includes:\nTomb Raider\nTomb Raider: Hitman: Absolution Weapon Pack 1 (DLC)\n8 inch posable figurine of main character Lara Croft made by Play Arts Kai\n15x19\" double sided map\/poster\n5x7\" lithographic print on heavy stock depicting Lara Croft\nThree iron-on badges featuring icons from the game\nSoundtrack disc (10 tracks)\nCollectible \"Survival\" metal tin that contains the game and all above extras","ReleaseDate":"2013-03-05T00:00:00-08:00"},"15988":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ccd689d1-966e-4b9d-b778-0e31cd80d4ad.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7379136c-7c15-4141-a571-b3f7820c12f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b9e70132-196d-482d-af5e-374332ddce4f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dbbaf8ca-9d38-4396-b7a2-0152f46d6342.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"NBA 2K7","Overview":"The NBA 2K series is a series of basketball video games developed and released annually since 1999.

After EA Sports' rival publisher 2K Sports cancelled its own college basketball game, College Hoops, in 2008, EA changed the name of the series from NCAA March Madness to NCAA College Basketball. The series was discontinued on February 10, 2010.[1]\n\nLike other games based on NCAA sports, it could not feature the players' names (as that is against NCAA policy\/rules), so only the players' numbers were used in the rosters. Users were able to edit the rosters, putting in the correct names for each team if they wished to do so.

The player must affect the surrounding and dynamic terrain to progress. The goal is to safely navigate through each vivid stage and rescue survivors scattered about the cavernous environment. Each stage is in-effect a flow simulation whereby the player attempts to control various types of liquid (water, magma, etc) and solid matter (rock, earth) either by destroying it, manipulating it or moving it. These dynamic fluid effects are at the heart of the games visuals. Strategy is paramount in PixelJunk Shooter. The piloted craft is susceptible to extremes of heat, so the player must be careful about the craft's proximity to magma. If the craft becomes too hot, the player can regain a comfortable temperature by plunging into the nearest water source. Additionally, each stage presents a puzzle scenario for the player to solve in order to safely rescue as many survivors as possible. Both environmental elements and enemies, including Bosses, will attempt to hamper the player's progress.","Publisher":"SCEA","ReleaseDate":"2009-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16189":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Q-Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"3f0b5cb3-4058-477e-8193-c8482f728c10.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e52edf91-1c41-493a-8cc6-f6dc65e0f6eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"PixelJunk Shooter 2","Overview":"PixelJunk Shooter 2 is a video game developed by Q-Games for the PlayStation 3.

The difficulty level for the game is adjustable. The easiest mode will appeal to younger players who have probably never played a baseball game before in their lives, and the hardest mode—known as Spirits Mode—will give even the most experienced and advanced players a challenge with superior AI. Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode. For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to \"real\" speed). The basic batting interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel. Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes. The pitching is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.","ReleaseDate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"16242":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Der Puppenspieler","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SCE Japan Studio","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f4e684b4-20d5-4321-89ec-bc9678c92410.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1026557e-d5b3-426c-8dd5-a984761f7a88.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"79495105-d603-4d5e-b3e7-61215edf0450.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5e6aa3e3-8bda-4956-87c2-ea8e3908d675.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f6e63a25-327e-4eb7-878c-cb7cec9a3e84.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"91b15b24-689e-44fb-aad1-a65bdd1feb6e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"510bf6bc-711d-4da0-8d86-b3d8944a410d.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88f00cfe-cfee-4b4d-8ba5-c90e17a74d95.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"844a517c-02b3-4c64-9b1f-4f5aeb2caab9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"591ce779-610d-4799-b568-86efa96626ff.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"43e6062e-157e-4666-bb58-9d5d33772595.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7070ce50-24fe-4967-8f59-547ca11ee3f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2862da65-febb-4486-bb50-7906eb41b308.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"343903b0-f25a-42e1-833c-0a32438f006c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7ab618ab-3e63-4330-a99e-92072f0a3298.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"33c7f065-d9f8-4a21-bbdf-0eb78ad87530.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"321fde1a-dc94-4c5b-ad9e-2eaee77772dc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"55b283a6-015b-4855-b50b-0dc53a2b3e9b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d496366d-db16-41ed-91c2-83e166ffd320.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1c23f55f-4ece-4aee-8d94-162c3939cb2e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"37a88509-e4c1-492f-82b5-2c6a8b2bed50.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04ec854f-0571-4dcb-b66d-774ecd2ad1d5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ba746c1b-8166-4be5-94c4-6565d989a268.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"88e15ea7-1a74-46b9-8e7b-d73fe5989085.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0775f3c3-b865-4cbc-a38b-f06a0f18708d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ae99cbde-f9e8-47da-905e-75d0d7c58e53.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"07f092d2-04ad-47ec-926e-faef1d976fb7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Puppeteer","Overview":"One dark moonlit night, a young boy named Kutaro was carried away by the maleficent Moon Bear King to a black castle where the unlucky lad was transformed into a puppet. \n\nKutaro displeased the terrible tyrant, who devoured the boy's wooden head and cast away his body.

It was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows by Ubisoft in 2003 and OS X by Feral Interactive in 2004. A remastered HD version of the game was released for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in 2012. 2D versions were developed for the Game Boy Advance and N-Gage. A follow up game, Rayman: Hoodlums' Revenge, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005.

The game has both single player and online modes of play.[6] The single player campaign is divided into 5 chapters. Each chapter unlocks one of the game's five factions.

Overkills are awarded when players roll either two or three sixes. If a player rolls two sixes, he destroys twice as many units as he would normally.

The game is played from a 2.5D perspective, with players being able to move horizontally and vertically. The game has several new features over its predecessor such as non-linear levels, stealth-based combat, attack combos and usable equipment such as gas masks and night vision goggles.[1][4][5] Associate Producer James Wong stated in an interview that the original game was \"wave after wave of enemies\" and that the development team sought to \"go a little deeper\" while retaining the \"pick up and play nature of the original game.\"[6] The game spans three large levels that are traversed both horizontally and vertically.[6]\n\nThe player character is initially armed only with a knife, but can pick up other temporary-use weaponry such as grenades, rifles and rocket launchers.[1] The game sometimes requires the player character to use stealth to avoid enemy units or security cameras. Triggering any alarm will result in nearby enemies rushing to the source of the alarm trigger. Alarms can by triggered by making too much noise or by being noticed by one of the security cameras within the game's setting.[7] In a departure from Rush'n Attack, the player character is given a health bar instead of the original one hit death.[8]\n\nshank combos are the primary way in which players can earn points.[9] The combat system is based on systema, a Russian martial art.[9] As the character progresses new combos can be unlocked.[8] Chaining combos together will result in the player gaining more points earned.[10] The character can also dispatch enemies using stealth tactics. Generally stealth kills reward the player with a higher score.[10] Stealth kills can be performed by hiding in dark areas or by entering dark doorways, then exiting for the kill as an enemy passes.[9][11]","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-29T00:00:00-07:00"},"16393":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f869836c-f231-4116-b05b-205fa1fa8f6f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Ryoufuu no Melt: Days in the Sanctuary","Overview":"Japan","ReleaseDate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00-08:00"},"16394":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ryu ga Gotoku 1&2 HD Edition","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Fighting; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"2198f6f4-1245-406d-9960-6b8854f2e1b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6dca0841-b20a-4b2f-981a-dbdc345bafb6.jpg","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7f3547f-dec4-4f54-85dd-45cf7a3d5f3c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f4a0361-f1de-4428-9a79-e0ef8f2b7d67.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"948ffb37-729d-4ee5-9cda-99c8ce9c89c0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d06ddc8c-6202-416e-a342-1345cbeaee71.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f912e4d9-cd01-4fb3-8a15-aecd2ff90258.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ryū ga Gotoku 1&2 HD Edition","Overview":"This is a compilation featuring HD remasters of the first two games in the Ryū ga Gotoku (Yakuza in the west) franchise.

A key move in The Revenge of Shinobi is the somersault, which maximizes Musashi's jumping height and enables him to throw eight shuriken at once in mid-air. Additionally, some stages consist of multiple layers, such as the first scene of the Military Base and the freeway in Area Code 818. Switching between layer (outdoor\/indoor, or on-the-highway\/next-to-it) is also done with the somersault move.","ReleaseDate":"2012-05-22T00:00:00-07:00"},"16472":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"33e81419-235e-4c1f-9f2e-aee62de72039.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9d9ca70e-f66a-4633-a153-693d9d3657df.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"47a2a43f-68c1-4315-850e-c344b9a71b5c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"ToeJam & Earl","Overview":"ToeJam & Earl is an action video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Mega Drive video game console.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.\n\nThe game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.\n\nSince its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis\/Mega Drive games of all time\".[2]","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-06T00:00:00-08:00"},"16479":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Westone","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"2f7ddf4d-a337-42c5-b803-61ba1ca114a6.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Wonder Boy in Monster World","Overview":"Wonder Boy in Monster World, known in Japan as Wonder Boy V: Monster World III, is a side-scrolling action role-playing game originally developed by Westone and published by Sega for the Mega Drive\/Genesis in 1991.

When doing these the player's boost gauge fills up and when it's full it's possible to use adrenaline to get a boost by pushing the sled into overdrive. The player will then be able to accelerate faster, corner tighter and reach higher top speeds. Other tricks involve leaning forward to tighten the sled's turning radius or leaning backward to to gain a boost in traction and acceleration.\n\nThe game features a career mode as well as a single race mode and a multiplayer mode. In the career mode the player's aim is to become a professional snowmobile champion and along the way he will get access to new sleds and unlock special moves and new gear. This include upgrading the sled, painting it and applying various decals. The player can also unlock various outfits for the rider. In the single race mode the player can pick any rider and any course but only sleds unlocked in the career mode will be available. \n\nThe multiplayer mode involves a split screen mode for two players.

Stopping him requires Chaos Emeralds, and various individuals including heroes like Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles \"Tails\" Prower participate in a fighting tournament to gather them. In total there are eight playable characters (nine in later console releases) and two bosses (Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman).\n\nGameplay is mostly typical for a versus fighter, it is a one-on-one fight on a best two out of three basis. Players use jumps, punches, kicks and special weapons. Bean the Dynamite for example, a duck-like character who makes his debut in the Sonic universe, uses bombs. Blocking is done by making use of a limited supply of barriers. The whole action is illustrated in a comical fashion though, like one would expect from a Sonic game. A round is won when a player managed to deplete an opponent's health, unless the timer runs out, in which case the character with the most energy left is the winner. Environments are 3D closed arenas, but the gameplay is mostly 2D, allowing limited sidestep maneuvers.","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-27T00:00:00-08:00"},"16648":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sonic Team","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"8e067dca-24f1-4166-a4cb-dc0f5af2c2e5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"44e0738d-ce05-4ba5-a8e0-f26672c743ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a46273e0-b85d-4fb4-8d7a-ab7eaa4da21f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8332a98c-7921-4549-9b5d-876569473283.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Sonic CD","Overview":"Sonic the Hedgehog CD (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグCD Sonikku za Hejjihoggu Shī Dī?), or Sonic CD (ソニックCD Sonikku Shī Dī?), is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega originally for the Sega\/Mega-CD in 1993.

Based on the same canon, the game's events are set between the two films. Players can play as one of two characters, Captain James T. Kirk, or his second in command, Commander Spock. The whole game is co-op, with an AI player or friend playing whichever character you do not play as. Playing alone characters can only be switched between chapters and not during gameplay. With another player, a drop-in mechanic is supported. The antagonist of the game is the Gorn, an evil reptilian race, who attack a New Vulcan colony through a rip in space. \n\nThe game revolves around a cooperative mindset, with players playing off each others different skill sets. Each character has a distinct set of abilities, with Captain Kirk being a more typical shooter, armed with a phaser with a stun setting, and Commander Spock, a more stealth based character armed with a couple of abilities as well as a gun with a freeze setting. As the player plays through the game, they gain experience by scanning objects, hacking and discovering audio logs. Experience is used to unlock additional abilities for their respective weapons. The tricorder offers many shooting options and the characters have the ability to rewire turrets and hack flying drones. The two characters can help each other out by boosting shields and weapons.\n\nNext to the corridor-based shooting gameplay, there is a space battle with turrets and many platforming sections. Certain stages are set in space, where characters need to dodge debris and a single level contains underwater sections.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2013-04-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zfea3JXZoAk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Trek_(2013_video_game)"},"16849":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Access Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"d5903e8c-b526-4d4b-a4fc-e125ed482d2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59401718-1887-4931-9b7b-9c7bddc956b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut","Overview":"Deadly Premonition, known as Red Seeds Profile (レッドシーズプロファイル?) in Japan, is an open world, survival horror video game developed by Access Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is similar to a series of murders across the United States.\n\nDeadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.\n\nThe game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the survival horror genre.

As the most recent entry in the dormant series, the game continues to be played, with unofficial roster updates being released reflecting subsequent seasons.[1] However, the game is now out of print and has become one of the most valuable and sought after games on the PS3 and Xbox 360.","ReleaseDate":"2013-07-09T00:00:00-07:00"},"17376":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Iron Galaxy Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"10c495af-2b89-42b1-8f35-b367b0462d8d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"78de3460-88b3-4c67-889d-8c716da05714.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70ddbb1b-5994-4097-8212-f54f4f8e6557.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"68fb80e3-0a08-40cd-bcae-85c55712666a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Marvel vs. Capcom Origins","Overview":"The heroes of Marvel are back on the fighting ground, ready to do battle with Capcom's greatest legends, and with each other.

Originally established as America's covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic.\n\nIn the spirit of the XCOM franchise, The Bureau's calculated combat design requires players to think and act tactically. The game's third-person perspective gives the player a sense of spatial awareness and grants them the freedom to transition in and out Carter's unique Battle Focus ability seamlessly -- heightening the tactical shooter action.

Assisted by hacker specialist Charlie Cole, Sam and Vic manage to escape, although Vic is severely injured from protecting Sam from a grenade. Soon after, a terrorist organization calling itself \"The Engineers\" claims responsibility for the attack and announces that this attack is the first of a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on United States assets which they call \"The Blacklist.\" They declare that they will halt the attacks only after the U.S. Government recalls all American troops deployed abroad.\n\nIn response, President of the United States Patricia Caldwell, who had just shut down the corrupt Third Echelon, assigns Fisher, Charlie Cole, Isaac Briggs and Anna 'Grim' Grímsdóttir to a newly created special operations and counter-terrorism unit called \"Fourth Echelon.\" She installs Sam as the commander and charges the unit with the task of hunting down The Engineers and stopping them. Fourth Echelon's base of operations is a customizable cargo plane, codenamed \"Paladin.\"\n\nSam and his new team's first course of action is to capture Andriy Kobin from a CIA safe house in Benghazi, Libya and obtain information from which they can learn more about The Engineers' plans. Sam successfully extracts Kobin and arrests him, keeping him aboard the Paladin. Kobin reveals some information about his business associates in Mirawa, Iraq. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold there, Sam learns that the Blacklist attacks are more serious than originally thought. Sam arrives at a death chamber to find an executed US soldier whose execution was taped. The executioner was Majid Sadiq (Carlo Rota),[7] a terrorist and former MI6 agent. In the video, Sadiq directly tells Sam to stop intervening or suffer the consequences.\n\nIntelligence from Mirawa points to the next Blacklist attack being in Dallas, Texas. Sam asserts to Fourth Echelon that a direct attack would be too simple and that the true target is another city. Charlie notes that the TSA list of \"do not fly\" citizens was offline for roughly six hours with a group of men traveling through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the time the list was offline. The target is a water filtration plant off Navy Pier, which is scheduled to release a hazardous biological agent into the water supply of Chicago. Sam stops the devices and shuts off the outflow valve, sparing Chicago.\n\nKobin reveals to Sam back on the Paladin intelligence about one of his associates, a dealer named Reza Nouri who supplies mercenaries for hire. Sam assaults his mansion in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay and interrogates Nouri. Nouri states that to whom he lends his men is none of Sam's business. During the interrogation, Nouri's mansion comes under attack from suspected operators of Quds Force. Nouri agrees to give up Sadiq in exchange for a safe extraction.\n\nGrim and Charlie gain intelligence about a sleeper cell of The Engineers in London, England. The cell has been activated and Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill to gain intelligence on The Engineers' next plans. Sam finds shipping documents from Iran, confirming the suspicion that Iran and Quds Force were involved in the Blacklist attacks. With the last of the chemical bombs about to leave the shipping bay, Sam sneaks onto the truck and places a GPS tracking device inside the bomb. Sam is exposed to near lethal amounts of the chemical agent and, while trying to exfiltrate, is captured alive by Sadiq. Briggs, who was providing sniper overwatch, is forced to rescue Sam, but lets Sadiq escape.\n\nAfter healing from the exposure to the chemical weapons, Sam infiltrates the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran, which has been transformed into a Quds Force headquarters. Sam installs a flash drive on a mainframe computer given to him by Charlie, which is programmed to search and rip anything related to the Blacklist attacks. The flash drive reveals nothing, proving that Iran is not behind the Blacklist attacks, reversing previous suspicions.\n\nBack on the Paladin, Briggs informs Sam that the GPS tracker placed inside the bomb in London has reached US soil in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Grim analyzes that there are a total of four bombs containing hazardous nerve agents. The bombs arrive at the transit yards in Philadelphia, forcing Sam and Briggs to disarm the bombs before the nerve agents are released into the mass transit system. Grim's analysis also assess that a high value Engineer target is present. After Sam and Briggs successfully defuse the fourth bomb, Sam gives chase to the Engineer leader in the transit system. The Engineer escapes the train, but is shot dead on site by responding police officers.\n\nReturning to the Paladin empty handed, Fourth Echelon is given a break when Nouri is checked in as a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sam and Briggs form a plan to break into Guantanamo to interrogate Nouri again under Briggs' CIA credentials. Sam successfully interrogates Nouri who confirms that Sadiq is the mastermind behind the Blacklist attacks, but is unable to tell Sam when the next attack will be. Nouri also admits that Sadiq knows of Fourth Echelon and is aware of the team's individual identities. Sam evades capture and escapes the prison, riding off from the bay with the help of Briggs in a boat. Briggs drives himself and Sam to the Paladin, which has landed at an airstrip in the Yucatán province of Mexico.\n\nBefore Fourth Echelon can take off, the Paladin comes under assault by terrorists. Sam and Fourth Echelon fight off the attack, which Charlie reveals was his fault for contacting an old friend while landed. After taking off, the Paladin comes under a cyberattack directly from Sadiq. All of the intelligence on board the Paladin is compromised, as well as the on-board computers, leading the Paladin towards a crash in the Gulf of Mexico. Fourth Echelon successfully regains control of the Paladin, averting the crash. During the cyberattack, Sadiq successfully executes the \"American Fuel\" Blacklist attack on Sabine Pass, Louisiana, the largest oil reserve in the US.\n\nWhile the US government activates continuity of government procedures, Sam assaults Sabine Pass, shutting down the leaking oil from reaching other reserve posts, averting a chain reaction. Another high value Engineer is present, to whom Sam gives chase. The Engineer reveals the true and final plans of Sadiq: to extract all US military secrets. Knowing continuity of government procedures, Sadiq successfully kidnaps a group of high level civilian and military personnel, including the Secretary Of Defense, and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport (DIA).\n\nFourth Echelon calls President Caldwell, who directly orders Fourth Echelon to divert from Denver. The Paladin pilots refuse to defy orders, so Sam orders Kobin to relieve the pilots of duty. Kobin successfully drops Briggs and Sam during a blackout landing at Denver. Briggs and Sam assault DIA, tasked with planting a virus which Charlie custom-built to safeguard against the transfer of files to Sadiq. Briggs surrenders to Sadiq in the computer terminal, separated from the other hostages. Sadiq's men torture the Secretary of Defense into complying with their demands, but Briggs intervenes, killing the Secretary before he can begin the data transfer.\n\nThe Engineers attempts to flee Site F using Briggs and the other hostages as human shields. It is revealed that Sam is disguised in an Air Force uniform at the very rear of the hostage group. Sam breaks free from his captors as Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men, and Sadiq escapes on foot after wounding Briggs. An unarmed Sam gives chase, disarming and assaulting Sadiq, before wounding him and taking him into custody. Even upon defeat, Sadiq claims that he has already \"won,\" threatening Sam that if he kills him, the twelve nations who are secretly backing The Engineers will rise and if he puts him on trial, he will \"spill every secret he knows.\" Leaving him with no choice, Sam employs the Fifth Freedom and unofficially imprisons Sadiq, while President Caldwell announces that he is killed and the game ends with Fourth Echelon prepares to continue operations. In the post-credits, it is revealed that Vic had recovered from his injuries and both he and Sam are seen about to interrogate the captive Sadiq.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-20T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EDhuMi-oJ9c"},"17684":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blizzard Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"343339b9-27ec-4397-b99a-d8300307121c.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7f3d3edd-4e73-42ec-8343-a130a86b77f2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"884a061e-8ac0-457d-8634-45757dae884e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28c6793d-a7fe-41e0-b1ab-9a1912c0ab4f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"33316ddc-9f12-4b8d-b4e8-7e3aa475b528.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b6f42e3e-9065-4ab8-9217-42443286a85b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c932032e-df95-4cc1-b0e2-9ffa2fd22561.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d7eee0b8-794d-479f-8a9c-ed5c1c0eb40c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d057a2f9-5232-4dee-94d8-5a265babcb25.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Diablo III","Overview":"The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo series.

Unlike later Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the actual sights on the gun for increased accuracy.

The story continues from the events in Tomb Raider: Legend as a direct sequel, but also addresses unexplained plot elements by association with Tomb Raider: Anniversary.[6] Underworld was released by Eidos Interactive for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows, in North America on 18 November 2008, Europe on 21 November 2008 and Australia on 5 December 2008. On 14 June 2012, Underworld was released on the Mac OS X by Feral Interactive.[7][8] It is the third game in the series to be developed by Crystal Dynamics and is also the first Tomb Raider game to be released on the PlayStation 3. Developers implemented new features into the gameplay, such as the dual-target feature and an upgraded inventory system, using an Active Sonar map and a multi-purpose grappling hook. The game also features a hint system and a new melee combat system where Lara has the ability to battle her opponents using kicks and grapple pulls. Downloadable content was also released exclusively for the Xbox 360, where the player takes control of Lara and her doppelgänger in two new chapters.\n\nUnderworld received mostly positive reviews for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Critics generally praised the environments, Lara's motion captured movements, story, puzzles, exploration, graphics and the less linear style of gameplay, although some criticism was directed at its \"haywire\" camera angles and \"dodgy\" combat system. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions received mostly moderate to negative reviews. Most cited them as having medium to poor graphics; being oversimplified; \"dumbed\" down; and bugged, especially the PlayStation 2 version. On 27 February 2009, Eidos announced that the game had sold around 2.6 million copies worldwide.[9] On 22 May 2009, Tomb Raider: Underworld was re-released as part of the Xbox Classics and Platinum Range lines for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, respectively.[10] Underworld, along with Legend and Anniversary, was included in the The Tomb Raider Trilogy compilation, which was released in March 2011 for the PlayStation 3.

The player also receives glowing coloured orbs - if they place these next to a gem of the same color, the orb and all identical colored gems shatter, and any gems above fall. The player's goal is to make this happen multiple times for each block placed, causing 'combos'. The larger the combo, the more Counter Gems (gems with timers on them) are dumped into the opponent's bin. If a player places multiple gems of the same color in a square or rectangular order, they merge together to become a larger single gem which increases the amount of Counter Gems that drop on the opponent's field. Occasionally, a player will also receive a diamond - placing this on a colored gem will eliminate all gems in the player's bin of that color, increasing the potential for combos even more.\n\nSimilar to Super Puzzle Fighter II X for Matching Service, HD Remix includes multiple variants of gameplay:\n\n-   X-Mode: Identical to the original arcade mode.\n-   Y-Mode: Same-colored gems break as soon as there are three aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\n-   Z-Mode: Gems rise up from the bottom of the bin, and the player controls a 2x2 cursor to rotate them and create combos.\n\nNew to HD Remix is X'-Mode (or X Dash-Mode), which is a more fairly balanced version of the original game. Many characters' special block patterns have been readjusted to level out the playing field.","Publisher":"Capcom Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"20151":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sumo Digital","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8d63c34f-1791-468d-ade7-5c86bc2751ce.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"98d7e304-197b-4a1b-b414-1781f67c0a56.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f52ad52c-f2b6-4912-8fe1-7dc3808bd7b6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e74ef52-c9ef-4918-acd2-0f13023f14aa.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"225f36f0-1aea-468d-9329-a61bafef1ae8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Rub a Dub","Overview":"Set in a bathtub, the player must move a rubber duck in order to collect a set of baby rubber ducks from each level before heading for the exit.

Like most fighting games, the aim is to defeat your opponent by draining their stamina gauge (HP is used in a certain game mode) with various attacks and special techniques. The player wins a round by draining all of their opponent's stamina, or by possessing more stamina than their opponent when time runs out. Gameplay uses five main buttons; light, medium, and heavy attacks, a dodge button, and a \"Style\" button. Along with the ability to use various special attacks and techniques with different directional inputs, each character possesses a Battle Style, allowing them to utilize additional moves with the \"Style\" button. Styles fall into one of six main categories: Ripple, Vampirism, Mode, Stand, Mounted, and Baoh Armed Phenomenon, each utilizing different abilities when the Style button is pressed. For example, Ripple users can use the power of the Ripple to augment the strength of their attacks, whilst Stand users can summon out their Stand, giving them additional move types whilst also making themselves more vulnerable.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure:_All_Star_Battle","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure:_All_Star_Battle"},"20489":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Watch Dogs"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"7516f877-30d0-40ad-84ac-7f4125550e86.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"279d8fdc-13eb-4e8b-bfd7-afd3bb1f4aa0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f603f327-dd99-4de8-a117-284537ec429e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9bf1f0f8-0753-4a1e-8b5e-a922aca25ed4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"26d0d14c-1875-43da-93c2-9e44986b54ec.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fd2efea9-498b-45d6-8b10-5bfdc172d16b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"642e3151-34d0-45cb-9868-421ff8054148.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ebfcbf87-4d05-4662-94fc-f5d58af31a86.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3611a78f-6d3e-4304-8774-16b45d97e968.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Watch_Dogs","Overview":"The storyline of Watch Dogs game is built around the concept of information warfare, data being interconnected, and the world's increasing use of technology—questioning who exactly runs the computers they depend on.

Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of \"Citadel space\". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the \"First Contact War\" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization. Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various planets, moons and other destinations.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2012-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_Effect_(video_game)"},"21200":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"1b6e9098-3794-49a4-8822-1d163b7eb145.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b754dfe4-599a-42e3-9302-2e8494483b52.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d479e6e2-a03a-492b-b3ed-111716d9c17e.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d1d85f61-0df0-4395-a059-32fc100ad471.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8dbc7cb4-b7c5-47fe-a0b5-b57251723106.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Tales of Monkey Island","Overview":"Tales of Monkey Island is a 2009 graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games and LucasArts. It is the fifth game in the Monkey Island series, released nearly a decade after the previous installment, Escape from Monkey Island. Developed for Windows and the Wii console, the game was released in five episodic segments, between July and December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, whose chapters told discrete stories, each chapter of Tales of Monkey Island is part of an ongoing narrative. The game was digitally distributed through WiiWare and Telltale's own website, and later through Steam and Amazon.com. Ports for OS X, the PlayStation Network, and iOS were released several months after the series ended.\n\nPlayers assume the role of pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who—while attempting to destroy his nemesis, the undead pirate LeChuck—accidentally releases a voodoo pox across the Gulf of Melange. With the assistance of his wife, Elaine Marley–Threepwood, Guybrush seeks out a cure. The game was conceived in late 2008, due to renewed interest in adventure game development within LucasArts. It was developed concurrently with LucasArts' special edition of the 1990 title The Secret of Monkey Island; LucasArts oversaw production of Tales of Monkey Island, and ensured that it matched the remake in certain areas, such as art direction. Production began in early 2009; franchise creator Ron Gilbert was involved in project planning, while development was led by Dave Grossman, who co-designed the first two Monkey Island games. The game's music was composed by Michael Land, and the core cast of The Curse of Monkey Island reprised their voice roles.\n\nTales of Monkey Island received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humor, voice acting and characterization; 1UP.com described Guybrush as Telltale's strongest and most expressive character yet. The game's music and graphics were also lauded. Complaints focused primarily on the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system. Tales of Monkey Island garnered several industry awards, and was Telltale's most commercially successful project until Back to the Future: The Game.","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EHojfwdLucI"},"21201":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Curve Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"7d3873f2-d46f-489f-8cdb-0e08dcaee048.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"78bd64f4-6285-41cc-b0fa-527e0b3bb81d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e9ea778-97da-49f0-a525-2bf5f00c89b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Stealth Inc: A Clone in the Dark","Overview":"Stealth Inc is a fast-paced stealth platformer featuring brutal hazards, ruthless enemies, fiendish puzzles and red pixels galore.

The citizens were upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie made a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans. This plot was later uncovered by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him.\n\nFollowing this, de Ferrer made a deal with a man named Baptiste, who was hoping to defect from the Assassins to the Templar Order. Baptiste pretended to act as the recently deceased François Mackandal, as a ruse to attract followers to his cause. He planned to poison New Orleans' nobles and take control of smuggling operations within the Louisiana Bayou. However, his sole purpose was to force Agaté, Assassin and mentor to Aveline, out of hiding in the bayou. Aveline tracked him down, however, killing his followers and assassinating the false Mackandal.\n\nIn 1766, the Templar Antonio de Ulloa arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left control of the area to French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport slaves to a Templar worksite in Mexico, creating a rebellion among French officials and the citizens of New Orleans.\n\nAgaté ordered Aveline to assassinate de Ulloa to eradicate Templar presence in New Orleans. Aveline ambushed de Ulloa's carriage and confronted the governor, who told her that slaves had been taken to Chichén Itzá. However, Aveline spared his life and let Ulloa leave the city, in return for a lens used to decode Templar documents and a map leading her to the Templar worksite in Chichén Itzá. Aveline's act of mercy destroyed any trust Agaté had in his student, as she had disobeyed his explicit orders.\n\nAgainst her mentor's wishes, Aveline disguised herself as a slave bound for Mexico and made her way to the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá. Whilst there, she came across a defiant slave who mentioned that Jeanne, Aveline's mother, was stationed in Chichén Itzá. Aveline investigated thoroughly and uncovered a page from Jeanne's diary and a map that lead to an artifact located inside a cenote. Upon exploring this cave system, she came across an ancient chamber filled with ruins from the First Civilization, along with a fragment of the artifact she was searching for, known as the Prophecy Disk.\n\nShortly after Aveline had acquired the artifact, de Ferrer, who was supervising the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá, broke through into the chamber. However, Aveline overpowered his soldiers and killed him. At the end of the tunnels, she found Jeanne, who realized that her daughter was an Assassin and believed that Agaté had sent Aveline to kill her. She fled, though not before warning Aveline that the Prophecy Disk should never reach Agaté.\n\nAfter two years of absence, Aveline returned to New Orleans to find that Spanish control was strong. After speaking to fellow Assassin Gérald Blanc, she learned that someone was bribing Spanish soldiers. Upon investigating, Aveline discovered that a man by the name of Vázquez was using Spanish soldiers to seize control of the bayou and take control of the bayou's smuggling operations, which would eventually lead him to discover the location of Agaté. Believing him to be the \"Company Man\", the head Templar of Louisiana, who de Ferrer mentioned in Chichén Itzá, Aveline immediately hurried to Agaté's hut to warn him of the threat posed by Vázquez's soldiers. Agaté told her to use the power of voodoo to spook the Spanish soldiers into abandoning their mission. Using her blowpipe, Aveline poisoned enough of Vázquez's soldiers so that the rest believed they were cursed and fled the bayou.\n\nAveline returned to Chichén Itzá and made peace with her mother, who directed her to a canoe inside another cenote. Aveline navigated her way through the cenote and retrieved the final piece of the Prophecy Disk. She offered to bring her mother back to New Orleans, but Jeanne decided to stay behind to take care of the community, which was now rid of Templar influence.\n\nAveline returned to New Orleans, continuously working to free slaves in the city. Her stepmother, Madeleine de l'Isle, became aware of her work and asked her to help a slave named George escape north. Aveline found a safe passage through the bayou for George to leave through. Whilst escorting him through the swamp, she met with her smuggler allies Élise Lafleur and Roussillon, helping them to deliver supplies to American patriots who were fighting in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nVázquez attempted to stop Aveline and her allies by sending Spanish soldiers their way, but failed. Aveline defeated Vázquez's soldiers and ensured George and the supplies reached their destination. After returning to the city, Aveline dressed herself in a noblewoman outfit and attended a governor's ball, in hopes that Vázquez would be there. After speaking with several guests, she located Vázquez and asked him to dance. Using her charm, she managed to assassinate him. However, to her surprise, Vázquez revealed that he was not the Company Man.\n\nAveline next spoke to Gérald, who told her that a Templar working for the Company Man had been found on the New York frontier. Aveline learned that the Templar was Officer Davidson, a Loyalist soldier of the Ethiopian Regiment. Aveline reached the New York frontier in 1777 and met Connor, a half Mohawk, half British Assassin fighting the Templars during the American Revolution.\n\nAveline and Connor made their way through the frontier to a fort where Officer Davidson was located. Connor distracted the guards and allowed Aveline to slip inside the fort. She confronted Officer Davidson, shocked to learn that he was actually George, the escaped slave she had helped flee north. He attempted to escape, but Aveline managed to shoot his carriage and prevent his departure. From him, Aveline finally discovered the identity of the Company Man: Madeleine de L'Isle, her stepmother. Upon returning to Louisiana, Aveline hurried to her family's mansion and confronted her stepmother. Madeleine revealed to Aveline that she had secretly manipulated her life, preparing her for induction into the Templar Order, as she believed that they shared a common goal.\n\nAfterwards, Aveline traveled to the bayou and met with Agaté, informing him of Madeleine's identity as the Company Man. Agaté was unable to accept his failure and believing that Aveline had sided with the Templars, attacked her. Aveline overpowered him and attempted to convince him to leave Louisiana for his own safety, but Agaté could not live with the humiliation and instead chose to dive to his death.\n\nAveline decided to infiltrate the Templars and eradicate it from within. Upon returning to New Orleans, she made her way to the Saint Louis Cathedral and gave Madeleine Agaté's necklace to show her allegiance. Following this, she was inducted into the Templar Order by her stepmother. Aveline then gave her the two halves of the Prophecy Disk, which Madeleine placed on an altar and added another piece to hold the two fragments together. However, she could not make sense of the scrambled messages within. Aveline saw this as her moment to strike and reclaim the Prophecy Disk. She eliminated all the Templars inside the cathedral and assassinated Madeleine.\n\nNow alone inside the cathedral, Aveline stepped up to the altar where the Prophecy Disk had been placed. She connected the locket she wore around her neck, which once belonged to her mother, to the artifact, causing it to display a holographic recording detailing a message from the time of the First Civilization. This message recounted the election of Eve as the leader of the rebellion during the Human-First Civilization War.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2014-01-14T00:00:00-08:00"},"21273":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"15a28972-5069-4def-84f0-a8aa9b62eac5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry","Overview":"Born a slave, Adéwalé found freedom as a pirate aboard the Jackdaw as Captain Edward Kenway's second-in-command.

Lyra's levels primarily involve platforming, stealth and puzzle solving,[3] whilst Iorek's are mainly melee combat based.[4]\n\nA major aspect of the gameplay of Lyra's levels involves the shape-shifting ability of Pan, who has access to four forms; Ermine, Sloth, Hawk and Wildcat, each with its own unique ability. The Ermine's ability is \"Insight\", which allows Lyra to discover information about her surroundings, find hotspots, and unveil secrets. The Sloth's ability is \"Whip\", which allows Lyra to swing from poles and reach areas she cannot simply jump to. The Hawk's ability is \"Glide\", which allows Lyra to glide a short distance, covering gaps she wouldn't be able to any other way. The Wildcat's ability is \"Climb\", which allows Lyra to climb certain surfaces to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Players often have to shift form mid-move. For example, to reach a certain platform, Lyra may need to use the \"Whip\" ability to swing on a pole, and after releasing herself from the pole may need to immediately use the \"Glide\" ability to reach the platform.[5][6][7]\n\nAlso important in Lyra's levels are Evasion and Deception minigames. Evasion games occur whenever Lyra is spotted by an enemy and involves button presses to correspond with icons on screen to allow Lyra escape from her pursuer. Deception games are more common and occur regularly throughout her levels. These games take place whenever Lyra is involved in a conversation with someone and is attempting to deceive them. The better the player performs in the minigame, the more successful Lyra is in her deception. The minigames include, but are not limited to, matching symbols, collecting falling icons, avoiding falling icons, a Whac-A-Mole type game and a snooker type game.\n\nAnother major aspect of the gameplay is the Alethiometer. Once the player has access to the Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically, some must be sought out by the player. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned a hand on the Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the handle automatically turns to the correct symbol. Words she doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified in the first part of the game, the easier the balancing game is.","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZFcAn3TsLHw"},"21378":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Banpresto","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"0ec03c28-7cc9-43ac-b1d8-54e55d05ac51.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc8322b5-b574-4e23-a7f2-de051ae8e87e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"2nd Super Robot Wars Original Generation","Overview":"Developed by the same team behind Super Robot Wars Original Generation Gaiden, the game uses high-energy, dynamic action for the in-game battle sequences.

The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.[8]\n\n47 hides Victoria at a Catholic orphanage somewhere in Chicago and contacts an International Contracts Agency (ICA) informant named Birdie, who asks him to kill a wealthy gangster nicknamed The King of Chinatown, in order for him to play ball. After eliminating him, 47 meets with Birdie, who briefs him about Blake Dexter, the CEO of Dexter Industries, who may have more information on Victoria. As payment, 47 is forced to give his signature Silverballers to Birdie. 47 learns that Dexter is in the \"Terminus\" hotel and after evading Dexter's henchmen, eavesdrops on him. 47 learns from Dexter's conversation with his secretary Layla that he plans to kidnap and auction Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 attempts to strangle Sanchez, Dexter's enormous bodyguard, who proceeds to knock 47 unconscious. After Dexter discovers who he is, he almost kills him, but decides as he doesn't want that kind of attention. Just then, a hotel maid comes in and discovers 47, thinking he is dead. Dexter kills her, plants the weapon with 47, douses the room in alcohol, ignites it, and leaves with Layla and Sanchez. Framed by Dexter for the murder, 47 escapes the hotel and evades the police. 47 contacts Birdie, who tells him to go to a local strip club and kill the owner, Dom Osmond, who works as an informant for Blake Dexter, so that he can protect Victoria. 47 kills Osmond and learns from a phone message in his office that Birdie is being hunted by Wade—–a sociopathic mercenary, who is a close friend of Dexter and is under his employ. Despite killing henchmen that were looking for Birdie, Birdie still sells Victoria's location to Wade so that he can save his life. 47 reaches Victoria and learns that the necklace Victoria has keeps her alive. Wade and his henchmen raid the orphanage and massacre most of the nuns. 47 is forced to pick up fuse boxes that are scattered across the orphanage, since the elevator to the basement breaks down. After finding them all, 47 installs the fuse boxes and starts the elevator. Despite 47 's efforts, Victoria is still kidnapped by Wade. 47 manages to shoot Wade, but Victoria is then taken hostage by Lenny, Dexter 's son. 47 interrogates Wade to reveal Victoria 's location—–Hope, South Dakota—–and leaves him to die of his injuries. Meanwhile, Birdie approaches Dexter, offering to broker the ransom of Victoria back to the Agency, but he is rejected. In anger, Birdie secretly provides information about 47 's location to Travis's assistant, Jade, and information about Dexter to 47, hoping to profit off the situation. After arriving in Hope, 47 retrieves his Silverballers after Birdie informs him of their location at a gun store. Later, 47 kills Lenny 's gang and interrogates Lenny himself. The player then drives him to the desert, and the player can either kill him or leave him in the desert. Learning from Lenny that Victoria is at the Dexter Industries HQ, 47 infiltrates the facility and destroys their research data on her while assassinating its scientists, and discovers that Victoria is in fact a genetically engineered clone bred to be a top-class assassin like him; however she can only use the skills of an assassin when she wears her necklace. 47 kills Sanchez in an underground cage fight after learning from him that Victoria was taken back to Hope. Recuperating at a hotel, 47 survives an ICA attack led by The Saints—–elite nuns in leather outfits and kills them.\n\nInfiltrating Hope Courthouse Jail, 47 reaches Victoria but is subdued by the corrupt local sheriff Clive Skurky, who is working with Dexter. The ICA, led by Travis, take over the town in an attempt to get Victoria back and kill 47; but she is nowhere to be found, while 47 escapes the jail and the 'Agency. He then confronts a wounded Skurky in a church, demanding Victoria 's location. Skurky tells 47 she is at Blackwater Park, then dies from his wounds. Travis pays a ransom of ten million dollars for Victoria, but Dexter doesn't keep his side of the bargain and keeps both Victoria and the money. 47 arrives at Dexter 's penthouse and kills Layla after she tries to seduce him (and fails). Dexter, not knowing that Layla has been killed, threatens to destroy the hotel's roof if she doesn't meet him there within five minutes. As Dexter is about to leave the hotel with Victoria and the money by helicopter, 47 mortally wounds him. 47 saves Victoria, while Dexter, with his dying words, apologizes to his Lenny, and asks for his money. Victoria, who is disgusted by Dexter 's words, opens the briefcase containing the ransom and throws the money onto his dying body. 47 and Victoria then leave the hotel. 47 learns from the letter Diana gave to him that Travis created Victoria without the Agency 's knowledge; in the letter, she also requests that 47 kill Travis to protect Victoria. Pursuing him to England, 47 finds the ICA exhuming the Burnwood family graves, believing Diana 's death to have been faked. After killing Jade, and then his personal guards, 47 corners Travis, who asks him if Diana is dead. 47 refuses to answer and kills Travis.[9] During a closing cutscene, 47 watches Diana and Victoria from afar before a message from Diana welcomes him back to the Agency, revealing that the shot 47 fired at her was non-lethal. Victoria also considers disposing of her necklace to prevent her from hurting anyone, with Diana telling her to do what she has to. Another cutscene then shows Birdie offering information on 47 to Cosmo Faulkner, a detective investigating his case.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aTgmFcoOmqQ"},"22607":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Keen Games","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"91cc7d2c-e5ad-407f-827e-ce46f2a2e94b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08d74e6b-d0e9-4048-ac7d-381f3f00f814.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f4c857dc-1368-4597-a4ec-e53dc47aa30e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e5941466-2ac5-41ea-a65d-aa875db8c0ed.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sacred 3","Overview":"Sacred 3 is a hack and slash brawler named as the third full game in the Sacred video game series, despite notable differences in both gameplay and design.

It is the sequel to the 2011 PSP game Akiba's Trip. The protagonist is called Nanashi or 'Nameless', but this can be changed before starting the game. He is an otaku-type high school student who is on his way to a job interview. He does not remember what happens next, but he ends up strapped on an operating table where he is told that just like many others he has signed a contract with the Magaimono organization. This contract allowed them to turn him into a synthister, a vampire-like superhuman that feeds off other people's life energy. He needs to absorb the energy for Magaimono, but he is quickly rescued by a girl called Shizuku Tokikaze. She is a friendly synthister and her blood allows the protagonist to withstand his task and defend Akihabara instead.\n\nHe becomes a hunter to defeat the synthisters who prey on regular humans. Along with a band of freedom fighters Nanashi gets to roam the streets of Akihabara with over 100 shops modeled after the real life ones. Fights are done with brawling beat 'em up gameplay against one or more opponents in a small environment. Just like the protagonist himself the synthisters are sensitive to sunlight, so he needs to weaken the durability of their clothing with attacks until a part starts to blink and then there is an opportunity to tear off one or multiple parts of their clothing through a stripping mechanic, exposing them to sunlight which kills them. When multiple parts blink it is possible to perform chain strips. Rather than being a hentai title, the game presents the undressing in a quirky manner and does not contain full nudity. In the fighting system it is possible to attack using multiple stances and perform duo attacks with allies. Attacks are based on targeting the head and the upper and lower body. They can be strung together to form combos and there are many types of weapons, that can be upgraded multiple times, each with their own attacks, strengths and weaknesses. The character is also able to jump, avoid incoming attacks and counter blocks with special moves that break them.\n\nNext to the fights a large amount of time is spent exploring the environment and completing missions to earn money. There are also many NPCs to talk to. Conversations often have dialogue trees and the answers not only affect the fights with synthisters, but also the relationships with the male and female cast of characters who can join or leave the protagonist's, with the option to pursue one of four love interests with their own endgame. A lot of communication is accessible through a smartphone, for instance to receive e-mails, check the Pitter social network, access the map or use the camera to take shots. Because of the large environment it is possible to fast travel between locations. The game contains many shops where items, weapons, clothing and food can be bought and sold. The character's main characteristics are based around an attack and defense rating, as well as a large amount of customization for weapons and different types of clothing items that influence his head and upper and lower body durability during fights.","Publisher":"Xseed","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FNAa85Wwo3Q"},"22960":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"5pb.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"aac5266a-8c83-41cf-9385-f38ad58b1477.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dbdaf80f-8f55-416a-b929-719870d59404.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3766deb2-49e4-4ee0-a032-7a33b5494181.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1ce07700-b2e6-45ac-a760-9d4abb1b3a34.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5bb6cee5-1bd3-40ce-a083-26982938e4fb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ab603701-1692-4d24-846b-6402d9563939.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"3dabcb89-5d41-4b4e-a56e-8c09a09709e8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"35ac3844-3887-43d7-ba47-d093a9519eb4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"30710d8a-e195-4e27-be82-06eefd92e0f9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Phantom Breaker: Extra","Overview":"Phantom Breaker is a 2D fighting game that supports two distinctive fighting styles.

All four games are accessible, spectator-friendly, and deeply replayable.\n\nJohann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers. Players try to jostle their opponents' controllers while protecting their own. How fast you can move your controller depends on the varying tempo of the music. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! The goal is to be the last player remaining.\n\nBaraBariBall is a fighting\/sports game for two or four players. Players score by dunking the ball in the water on the opposing team's side but lose a point for falling into the water themselves. In addition to a wide range of tactical maneuvers, players have seven air jumps, allowing for unprecedented control and ridiculously awesome aerial combat. BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities.\n\nSuper Pole Riders is an enhanced, extended version of the hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders, bringing the highly-technical, physics-based controls of the single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle. Two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole.\n\nHokra is a minimalist digital sports game. A fast-paced, competitive game for two teams of two players each, Hokra features simple controls and minimal rules while retaining the depth that makes multiplayer games exciting for advanced players. Like the sports from which it draws inspiration, Hokra is engaging to both player and spectators.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2014-05-07T00:00:00-07:00"},"23821":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Polytron, Blitworks","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"e6773f06-5eeb-454a-a59e-9273390aefb9.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8b1d261-bd7f-4a69-a5aa-32919a902e20.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b21ab620-0997-4338-9c30-db98b98ea8cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fez","Overview":"Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world.

The player takes control of a red shape that represents a string in a programming environment. The goal is to move through an abstract environment to complete 100 levels by moving and jumping. A level is completed when the shape is moved to a white outline of its form.\n\nWhile the environment is a plain collection of shapes and the puzzle platforming is straightforward, the game is brought to life through the narration, explaining the thoughts and the emotions of the shape. The red shape is called Thomas and he feels alone. He has no idea where he is and does not know his purpose, but he quite enjoys moving around and jumping. Soon after, other shapes appear and while they provide a method for more complex puzzles by working together, the story's focus is on the interaction between the shapes, building their personality through their cooperation and abilities. The first to appear next is Christopher, an orange cube who takes an immediate dislike to Thomas. He cannot jump as high and they often need to act as stepping stones for each other. Other shapes to appear are the long and high jumping John, the large cube Claire who feels like a superhero because she can float on water while other shapes drown when they come in contact with it, and Laura who can be used to bounce as a trampoline.\n\nIn levels with multiple shapes, the player can switch between them to control them individually. Those levels have multiple white outlines and they can only be completed when all shapes are in the correct place. Not all levels contain all shapes at once but the player has no control over this at the start of a level. A grumpy Chris will for instance go about alone, and often the choice of the participating shapes and the level\/puzzle design complement each other to visually express their emotions. In the level where Chris starts to fall in love with Laura for instance, the level is designed with a low ceiling showing Chris jumping like mad on Laura's trampoline shape. Later on a nemesis is introduced as a floating cloud.\n\nA DLC expansion called Benjamin's Flight was first introduced as a commercial add-on for the PlayStation versions. Later it was made available for free for platforms were the game was already released (PC) and new platform versions had it included by default (iOS, Android, Wii U and Xbox One).","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2013-04-23T00:00:00-07:00"},"23823":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tiburon","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Platform; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"caedf021-283c-45f9-b459-2b920e38ab0b.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2e40e3d8-455e-498f-81ee-4106b1d3a004.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5f189e2-aff9-4be1-a152-1166b7b88a2c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e804bff2-fb40-48ac-b07a-0cca117e328d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"NFL Blitz","Overview":"The big hits and stellar plays are back with all-new NFL Blitz.

While their personalities and appearance are drastically different, they both share the nickname \"Shallie\" and uncover the reasoning why along each of their journeys- the dual main character system has been improved with separate stories and multiple endings for Shallistera and Shallotte. For the first time in the Atelier series, Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea will include a 360 degree camera, giving players more freedom as they explore a vast world map that has expanded greatly with many new environments that evolve based on how the player progresses. In the new Quest system players can either take on only assignments necessary to progress the game or earn more points engaging in additional, more challenging quests.","Publisher":"Koei Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quaIWHL7Etg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atelier_Shallie:_Alchemists_of_the_Dusk_Sea"},"24960":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"LEGO Batman 3: Más allá de Gotham","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Warner,wb","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"65e27959-1b2b-4287-a6e5-23b93c5c0d42.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c2d90656-3655-4870-879f-bb161ea9ff02.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a52183e2-a537-425e-b145-47785a5a7d59.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e9098117-39fd-405d-bccd-0f73d85fc0c5.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham","Overview":"The best-selling LEGO Batman videogame franchise returns in an out-of-this-world, action-packed adventure!

For the Xbox One and the PS4 it is the first release of the game for the platform. For the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game it is in some cases possible to carry over DLC and save data from the previous titles, also from 360 to One and PS3 to PS4. Owners of Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate for the PS3 and Xbox 360 can update their game for free to Last Round to play online matches against players of Last Round but need to buy the new content (characters such as Marie Rose, Phase 4, Nyotengu, Honoka, Raidou, and costumes) through DLC. The game as a single purchase is not available for the Xbox 360, see the trivia section. The game continues the typical DoA gameplay with 3D arenas and fighting on a 2D plane. Characters can sidestep and knock opponents through danger zones into other parts of the environment. Attacks consist of four buttons (light and strong punches and kicks) to perform combos, throws, blocking. There is no jump input. Advanced moves include counters, critical stun attacks and power blows. The game offers three play styles (casual, pro and online pro) and four main game modes: story, fight, training and online. Story consists of a series of one-round matches for different characters with cut-scenes and conversations that further the story and explain the motives of the different characters. Training consists of a 42-step tutorial where the game mechanics can be practiced. Online mode offers both ranked and lobby matches for online multiplayer. In lobby matches players can search for opponents and define settings such as the connection strength, region, minimum and maximum strength, fight rules, fight type and the number of rounds. The main fight mode offers the submodes versus, arcade, time attack, survival and team fight. Survival for instance is a series of fights against multiple characters in succession with a single health bar. There are solo, tag and team matches. Through an exhibition match players can unlock all characters and stages right away, but no new records or titles can be earned. Optionally throwdowns can be enable to see incoming online challenges from other players. The game offers 34 playable characters. All characters return from Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate, including those that were introduced through DLC (Marie Rose, Nyotengu and Phase-4) also including the guest characters Akira Yuki, Jacky Bryant, Pai Chan and Sarah Bryant. Entirely new for this version are Raidou (the boss from the first Dead or Alive) and Honoka. Fighters have different statistics based on strike, throw, hold, power, speed and moves and over 400 costumes that can be unlocked in-game or need to be purchased as DLC. For the arcade version the two new characters and balance changes were introduced in v2.0 of Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate - Arcade. All stages from Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate return with two new stages exclusive for the Xbox One and PS4 versions: Crimson (from Dead or Alive 2) and Danger Zone (Kazumi's stage from Dead or Alive). The PS3 and Xbox 360 version do not contain the new hairstyles and costume options screen, which allow you to customize your fighter’s appearance and preview it on the character select screen. The PC version was launched without online multiplayer, to be added at a later date, and it does not use the Soft Engine exclusive for the PS4 and Xbox One versions.","Publisher":"Koei Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0sKtW7oSs9I?t=120","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dead_or_Alive_5_Last_Round"},"25641":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dimps Corporation","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"5b3a4d97-60c1-4411-a1d0-ee2bec12ef46.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5f1ce790-69cc-4cb8-8568-b39825a460f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"31b59e1f-5986-404a-87fe-8aecae0eb07e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1d08a26c-875f-4522-ad27-6954fe1aaeb7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5b3b780a-64ad-4f3f-9e94-407f908d9c51.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"08dd1da0-5d15-4527-af88-b03041e353ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dragon Ball: Xenoverse","Overview":"DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE revisits famous battles from the series through your custom Avatar, who fights alongside Trunks and many other characters.

It was published by Sega and originally released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on 7 October 2014. The game is set 15 years after the events of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien film and follows Amanda Ripley, daughter of Alien protagonist Ellen Ripley, and her efforts to investigate the disappearance of her mother.\n\nUnlike previous video game adaptations of the Alien franchise, Alien: Isolation places a strong emphasis on stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature over the course of the game. It was designed more in line with Scott's film as opposed to James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 70s vision of what the future would look like. The game runs on an entirely new engine that was built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects as well as the alien's behavioural design.\n\nUpon release, Alien: Isolation received generally positive reviews from video game journalists and sold over two million copies in Europe and the US as of May 2015. Critics praised the game's retro-futuristic art direction and sound design, but criticized its story, characters, and voice acting. The game won several year-end awards, including Best Audio at the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards and Audio Achievement at the 2015 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"29071":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"00b685ee-13f4-42ea-883d-a33194cf4908.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f8d7b030-8785-4396-8278-d7ae795b7023.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"G1 Jockey 4 2008","Overview":"Horse racing simulators are geared towards an incredibly narrow niche market.

A blend of exciting arcade style combat and stealth mechanics packed with amazing graphics in a moody, immersive setting, Batman: Arkham Asylum offers diverse gameplay options that push the envelope for all action, adventure and superhero games.\n'Batman: Arkham Asylum' game logo\nBatman in hand to hand combat in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nKick it in combat gameplay.\nView larger.\nBatman gliding in on an enemy in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nAnd stealth action.\nView larger.\nThe Joker in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nMatch wits with The Joker.\nView larger.\nThe batarang in flight in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nUtilize utility belt gadgets.\nView larger.\nThe huge Killer Croc in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nTake on dangerous bosses.\nView larger.\nStory\nBatman: Arkham Asylum features an original story penned exclusively for the game by famous Batman author and five-time Emmy award winner, Paul Dini, whose credits include \"Lost\" season one and \"Batman: The Animated Series.\" As the game begins Batman is personally delivering his nemesis, The Joker, to the asylum at Arkham Island, but he is uneasy. Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?\n\nGameplay\nIn Batman: Arkham Asylum players strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.\n\nIn addition to the story-driven single player campaign Arkham Asylum also contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical\/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.\n\nKey Features\n\nUtilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.\nInvestigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.\nFace off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.\nBecome the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.\nChoose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.\nExplore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.\nExperience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.\nUnlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.\nEnjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.","Publisher":"Warner,wb","ReleaseDate":"2009-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum"},"29371":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"2K","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"72dc81d1-161c-42d4-8f5b-b6074eb77e2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"42f21532-bde0-4034-8c6e-682c750a3b75.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5faef9a2-e17d-4b12-9efc-e3e51521ef04.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"NBA 2K16","Overview":"The NBA 2K franchise is back with the most true-to-life NBA experience to date with NBA 2K16.

In 1994, a fictional asteroid collides with one of Jupiter's moons, 5254 Ulysses. This event sends about 10,000 meteors heading for Earth, all expected to impact the planet in five years' time. Faced with the prospect of extinction, the world's major superpowers build \"Stonehenge\", a network of anti-air railguns across the planet.[4] The meteor storm finally hits Earth in July 1999. While Stonehenge destroys enough of the inbound meteors to prevent human extinction, the remaining meteors still ravaged about 20% of the Earth's surface, destabilizing the economy and collapsing the world order.[4][5][6] The disaster hits Europe and Asia especially hard, forcing the nations to reorganize and create automated refugee zones. Twenty years later, the United Nations Forces finds itself fighting against terrorist organizations around the world. To better combat the terrorist threat, the UN hires Arrows Air Defense and Security, a private military company specializing in aerial warfare.[4]\n\nThe player character and silent protagonist, callsign \"Reaper\", is a rookie pilot employed by Arrows. Arrows assigns Reaper to the \"Bone Arrow\" squadron, which includes long-time pilot \"Omega\" and ace veteran \"Viper\". Part-way through the story, Bone Arrow becomes rivals with Ridgeback Squadron, a squadron of elite UNF pilots headed by leader \"Slash\" and his second-in-command, \"Edge\". The main antagonist forces are the Sons of Troia, a group of armed terrorists who later create an independent \"Federation of USEA\" or USEA Federation. Reaper's actions against the Sons of Troia and USEA soon make him a recognized mercenary ace pilot.[4]\n\nElements in the game, such as the Ulysses disaster, the Stonehenge superweapon and the rise of the USEA enemy faction (a new multinational military federation (the \"United States of EurAsia\"), rather than a fictional continent), are direct references to Ace Combat 4: Shattered Skies, but played on Earth instead of \"Strangereal\", the fictional planet setting of previous Ace Combat games.[7] Furthermore, the player character taking the role of a mercenary pilot of a private military company hired by the UN to keep the \"post-Ulysses\" world stable to regional dispute and terrorism attacks, is similar to the storyline of Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War. Other elements, including fictional aircraft, names of locales and specific mission settings, reference elements of previous games in the franchise.","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2014-05-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ace_Combat_Infinity"},"31536":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f4444b58-928e-43fa-b97f-60f20d8a044f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a6c42c73-d360-4723-9d21-26bf35509a77.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc5b877e-0e85-44fa-be2d-a8bb0810a016.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Super Mega Baseball","Overview":"Tight controls and a smooth learning curve will have you knocking it out of the park in no time in this awesome arcade baseball simulator.

The Ego system offers a fine-grained control of difficulty on a per-user basis, which has been widely praised for leveling the playing field in cooperative and competitive modes. This system will push seasoned gamers to their limits while simultaneously providing a gentle introduction for beginners.\nUp-to Four Player Local Co-op Play: In addition to solo play, players can try their hand at head-to-head, 2v1, 2v2 and co-op against the CPU. In co-op mode, teammates alternate batting\/running each time at-bat, and alternate pitching\/fielding each inning, meaning ballplayers need to be on their toes every play. To even games, players can use the Ego system to set up a competitive game between friends of any skill level.\nUltra Responsive and Blazing Fast Gameplay: Controls are easy to learn, but players will need to master jumping, diving, wall-catches, power-swings and cut-off plays to properly dominate friends. Short load times and a streamlined interface means most of the time is spent in the action, with nine-inning games taking around 20 minutes to play.\nFull Batting and Pitching Statistics: Most baseball statistics imaginable are available and ballplayers can use these to show off their MVP-quality skills.\nLeveling System: Players tally up Starpoints for hits, strikeouts and catches during each game and Level Up once they collect enough points. Players can hire staff to train and coach their squad, improving skill attributes such as Power and Speed.

The first-person action plays out in dystopian outpost environments on the original game's planet of Pandora, five years later, as a greedy industrialist called Handsome Jack seeks to weed out the local populace through a series of gladiator matches. Players choose from four new character types, each with three branches of specialized development in the game's RPG-like experience system. Experience comes with kills and quest completions.\n\nExpanding on the original game, Borderlands 2's gun system can create millions of different computer-generated weapons, as well as shields and equipment enhancements. Non-player characters are more expressive, and quest outcomes have more influence on the game world. In addition to the dusty, desert settings of the first adventure, the sequel visits a number of new Pandora environments, including the merciless frozen tundra where the revenge-driven plotline begins. Online, over a local network, or in split screen, the game's co-op mode allows a second player to freely join and drop out of a game in session.\n\nThe \"Deluxe Vault Hunter's Collectors Edition\" offers players the full game, an authentic Marcus Kincaid bobblehead doll, a hardbound art book, a set of four collectible stickers, a map of Pandora, and DLC including a digital comic.","Publisher":"2K Games","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Borderlands:_The_Pre-Sequel"},"32067":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Insomniac Games","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f5bab95c-8cfd-4cce-8937-601a7f987392.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b4549436-25c5-4371-8294-f1ba32b4bc7e.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ca30aa6c-e8d2-4d6f-a933-0e0c3a98dce1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time Collector's Edition","Overview":"The collector's edition is exclusive to PAL regions including Europe and Oceania and was released on November 6, 2009.

Your job is a little too tough for any one man to pull off on his own, so you'll have a loyal group of soldiers and a slew of weaponry including the Liberator Pistol, Panzerschreck, MG42, and B.A.R. all of which will come to your aid in the heat of battle.

While those put a twist on the concept of Robotron: 2084, Resogun draws inspiration from Defender, but with fixed patterns of enemies similar to Galaga rather than randomized attacks. The game consists of five levels (Acis, Ceres, Decima, Febris, and Mefitis) with bright neon colours where the player steers a space ship that needs to survive as long as possible through three phases followed by a boss. Levels consist of backdrops that are wrapped around as a cylinder and it is possible to get a glimpse of the other side of the level. The ship can shoot and move left or right and there is no border to it. Bonuses are earned by saving humans. These are shown as green figures locked up in chambers. Different types of space ships will attempt to kill the humans, who are only vulnerable when they are out of the chamber, and this need to be prevented by shooting down the invaders. At certain moments a human will be freed when certain enemies marked in green called keepers are destroyed. The ship can then pick up the human and drop it off at a marked location to set it free and receive bonuses such as boost, overdrive (more powerful weapons), smart bombs (clear the screen), shield or extra points. Boost provides a short moment of invincibility where the ship can crash into other ships destroying them, but also extending the boost. That way it can be maintained for a long time if the ship races through the enemy formations in a structured way. Power-ups and bonuses appear as large green crosses that can be shot to open them. Players are encouraged to keep the destruction going to maintain a score multiplier, which has a different cap based on the chosen difficulty level. The game can be played in an arcade mode (complete the levels one after another) or with single levels. There are four difficulty settings (Rookie, Experienced, Veteran, and Master) and three ships (Nemesis, Ferox, and Phobos) to choose from with different parameters for agility, boost and overdrive. The game supports online cooperative multiplayer games, but not local ones.","Publisher":"SCEI","ReleaseDate":"2014-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34998":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Obsidian Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"ae436809-1bb6-407b-b6e3-ac1bc17d84b9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b30bb876-5937-4680-ae2d-1d3e6209728d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dungeon Siege III: Limited Edition","Overview":"Torn asunder, the delicate balance of power between the kingdom of Ehb's powerful factions has fallen apart.

Combat gameplay is similar to Diablo. Players can acquire several pieces of armor and weaponry, each with different abilities and attributes. During combat players can chain attacks in combos, which in turn deal more damage with each hit. As more hits are gained on enemies, DeathSpank's Justice Meter will fill. Once full, the player can unleash more powerful attacks for a limited time.\n\nIn-game conversations with non-player characters are also a large part of the game. DeathSpank features advanced dialog options, similar to LucasArts' Monkey Island series which play a large part in unfolding the game's story.

The art, sound, and gameplay of the new game takes cues from the original 194X games, but stands out as its own unique entry. Gameplay resembles the classic 2D style that gamers expect, but the game utilizes a full 3D engine. Set in a World War II-themed locale, stages, vehicles, and weapons have the look and feel of WWII with some stylistic differences. The world in which 1942 takes place is not our own and the events that transpire are not historically accurate, nor are they intended to be.

The basic gist is that players participate in turn-based combat in which each opponent plays out cards from the deck (a combination of playing cards). Those cards either generate mana (there are five kind of manas) or summons (require mana to play out) which have different abilities. The goal is to reduce the opponent's life points to zero.\n\nDuring the campaign, the player helps out a planeswalker named Chandra Nalaar who chases evil wizards through the multiverse. From a gameplay perspective, it is a series of fights against specialised enemies which over time unlocks ten decks. Other available single-player modes are challenges, the new sealed mode and quick matches against the AI. Multiplayer consists of ranked matches or two-against-two matches with up to four human players (the latter is a singleplayer mode in the mobile versions).\n\nIn the sealed mode, the game gives out random booster packs which can be used to build a deck - two decks can be built for free; more booster packs are available via micro transactions. There is also an extra campaign to try out the new deck, but it can also be used in multiplayer. Besides this mode and additional cards, there are no differences to the predecessor.\n\nThe mobile versions are distributed for free, but only include a part of the content (three decks, a part of the singleplayer campaign, sealed mode and a planeswalker duel). The rest of the content has to be unlocked with a micro-transaction.","Publisher":"Wizards of the Coast","ReleaseDate":"2013-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"129506":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wizards of the Coast","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"2fdd2d9b-74fc-4f0f-80b5-6af10b346709.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9bc9e815-4667-43e5-91db-fc5462364a00.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Magic: The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013","Overview":"Face a greater challenge with Magic: The Gathering® - Duels of the Planeswalkers® 2013!\n\nIn the latest version of this hit franchise, play with friends or the AI as you travel across fantastic planes, take on new encounters and opponents, solve challenging puzzles, and face up to three other players in the Planechase multiplayer format.

The near apocalyptic setting and the quickly depleting resources of the remaining dry lands force nations into constant war, eventually culminating into World War III; all efforts by the United Nations to cease hostilities are thwarted by a seemingly endless supply of technologically advanced weaponry being sold to each side of every conflict. After investigation, the source is tracked back to EVAC Industry co. ltd, an arms dealer who's been reaping tremendously high profits from the situation, at times directly intervening to fuel the hostilities with utter disregard towards human lives; any attempt to negotiate with the board of directors has utterly failed, the earnings having proven high enough for the company to build its own cities, shipyards, defensive emplacements and even a private airport, to the point of assembling its own army of extremely well equipped mercenary troops.\n\nBeing unable to enter the fray officially, the UN sets up a strike team of four pilots, each pair given one of two advanced helicopters: the plan is to simulate a rebellion within EVAC forces and bring down the company's headquarters, where research on a series of tremendous warmachines is taking place; for this reason, the planes both bear EVAC insignia and callsigns and are built according to stolen prototype blueprints - by no means, in success or failure, must the operation be traced back to the United Nations. However, for all this secrecy to be effective, even in victories the assault choppers will have to be destroyed... and the pilots killed.

He makes daily phone calls to an undisclosed location every day, delaying the release of the disease by one more day. As Fisher, you must find out who the terrorist is, where he is, who he is working for, and above all, stop him.\n\nIn order to do this, you are taken all around the world, from Paris to Indonesia to the holy land Jerusalem. Sam comes equipped with his standard pistol and SC-20K. The SC has been improved, with an added scope with two levels of zoom. You have access to all the equipment from the first game, including Sticky Shockers, Diversion Cameras, Frag and Smoke Grenades.\n\nSam has also learned some new moves. He has the ability to perform a SWAT turn, which allows him to pass from one side of an open door to the other without being spotted. He may perform a half-split jump, enabling him to lean against one side of a wall to give him boost to jump higher. He can also whistle, to attract the attention of any nearby enemies.\n\nPandora Tomorrow also has a full fledged multiplayer game, playable on Xbox Live. The multiplayer ties in to the single player campaign, and it pits the Shadownet team (spies) against the Argus team (mercs). The game supports four players.\n\nMembers of Shadownet must infiltrate various complexes to retrieve canisters of a deadly liquid, but they must watch out for cameras, motion sensors and trip lasers, all of which alert the mercs to their position. The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind.\n\nOn the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team. Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is. To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets. The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs.\n\nMultiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers. More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live."},"140462":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"5a9b0cf9-03ab-4b5c-84ba-cbf709f63fd0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9f97684d-450f-4e80-ac95-e127899c5d40.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a88f1f31-262d-4094-806a-c039219a9f79.PNG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc019454-42a1-48cb-810a-e340c048b9c1.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5350313b-8b24-4ed1-b177-b19fb58f0820.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f7088f47-28d2-4292-a12a-ffac262e6f67.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory HD","Overview":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a stealth game developed by Ubisoft and released across all sixth-generation video game platforms in March 2005.

Activision wanted to bring back Guitar Hero for the next generation of video game consoles but wanted the new game to be innovative. FreeStyleGames was given a free rein to revitalize the series by Activision, which led to the development of a new guitar controller featuring a 6 button, 3-fret layout in contrast to the 5 button controller of previous games. FreeStyleGames also wanted to bring a more immersive experience to the player, and developed the main career mode GH Live to have the note pattern displayed atop full motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist during a concert, with the crowd and other band members dynamically reacting to the player's performance. FreeStyleGames also wanted to forgo the traditional downloadable content model to provide new songs for the game, and created the GHTV mode which encompasses curated playlists in the style of music television channels that are streamed around the clock, allowing them to easily acquire and add new songs. Within GHTV, songs are presented with the note track overlaid atop their music video or from live concert footage. GHTV allows players to pick up and play currently-streamed songs at any time or use money and in-game credits to play any song within the library, forgoing traditional downloadable content. The game was shipped with forty-two songs on disc and 200 songs within the GHTV library; New content has been added to GHTV on a weekly basis, provided through premium shows that earn players unique rewards.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guitar_Hero_Live"},"142352":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WayForward Technologies","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c22b322d-d093-4903-90ce-ad65e515b998.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c602daa5-2242-4af5-92ee-371b8bdbb04f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59ad2f55-4ef8-48dd-a070-f08913fe9d75.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6613a700-453b-4803-bf0b-25156f420eb3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3dd71e89-9102-44c0-85ae-e54c77de7a35.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9672294-65ac-495b-a8a4-2bd087fdb68d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aa5455d6-7cdb-481f-be7e-853490433490.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4b3f00bc-6920-4689-8f7b-1123df57ebd9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b10ecf7e-4aa8-4572-8668-978d1bad5909.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aa98e7e5-f619-4403-83cc-5b9958bd27d0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6af13fc1-c243-4c7e-9791-ab216e657bb2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5602c8d1-28bb-48fb-b402-a153b8a8f7bb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"66cb59f1-cbab-4cd6-ab8e-c873bd1fd9b9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BloodRayne: Betrayal","Overview":"The original video game femme fatale, Rayne, has returned to battle and feed in a brand new hack ‘n slash adventure.

Because of a religious code called the Way, these four races had prospered throughout the ages in their own separate towns. But as the years passed, the younger generations began to defect from the Way. Ultimately, with no protective code to guide the races, Yenching was invaded by the Gorillas and the Rats (known as the Din), led by Gorilla Minister Shun and Tak, the Rat Alchemist. Minister Shun now rules the majority of Yenching with an iron fist, and is said to reside in the volcanic mountain of Waa-Lo.\n\nThe story now focuses around a figure named Kay. Kay is a hotheaded young cat, and the Master's finest martial arts student. Like many of the people of the races, Kay does not believe in the Way, and likes to focus on physical skills and strength. This is what makes his friend, Su Ling, leave his town in disgust, hoping to find another town that would share her belief in resurrecting the Way. One day, in Kay's martial arts school, Shun's gorillas and the mayor of Kay's town declare that they must shut down the school because new 'Din schools' must soon be erected in the town. Kay is outraged, and even more so when his Master simply agrees to the new terms. And so, making up his mind, Kay sneaks into his Master's house at night (the Master is drunk, and asleep) and steals the mystical blade the Master keeps. Kay then jumps out of the town walls, and makes his way into the wilderness.","Publisher":"Nordic Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legend_of_Kay"},"142544":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blue Isle Studios","Genres":"Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"4277b935-1175-42d2-893f-250713ed8de3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cd78f496-94c6-4d5f-baf6-d82ab9eae7ee.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30cfea79-9585-4ec5-a8c0-ef1b46705673.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Slender: The Arrival","Overview":"Slender: The Arrival is the official continuation of the series from the original game creator Mark Hadley, teamed up with the writers behind the Marble Hornets series and the development team at Blue Isle Studios.

It was developed by SCE Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.\nThe game is played on an 8x8 grid. Each space on the grid is occupied by a Numblast cube bearing a number between one and four. Players control a 2x2 cursor which is used to rotate groups of four cubes either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more of the same cube form a square, they turn red and rotate, and their number increases by one (four cycles back to one). If another square is then formed, the relevant cubes also turn red and rotate. This process continues until no new square is formed, at which point all the red cubes disappear and points are awarded (a \"Numblast\" occurs when the entire play area is cleared in the same combo). A few seconds later the empty spaces are filled with random cubes. If the player fails to clear a cube within a certain time, it will turn black, and if all cubes turn black, the game is over. If four black cubes of any number form a 2x2 square, that square cannot be rotated (although the individual cubes within the square can be rotated if the player's cursor covers at least one non-black cube). After a certain number of cubes have been cleared, a special star cube appears which can occupy any number. When the special cube is used as part of a square, it eliminates all cubes of whichever number the square is otherwise made up of.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-07-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Numblast"},"151575":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PopCap Games","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"3a73286e-f63a-4a5d-8220-b684164e22f1.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9eda849a-c150-4a49-94a5-49d4a3d8770d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"34448149-3c9c-4a76-a4d5-a74dd5ca26ab.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e81582c9-e4ea-43a6-8910-d5e765af4e67.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Peggle","Overview":"Peggle is a casual puzzle video game developed by Sukhbir Sidhu and Brian Rothstein of PopCap Games.

The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.\n\nThere are about twenty professional players, modelled after their real-like counterparts and with signature styles. Famous players such as Roger Federer and Justine Henin are present, along with a few legends such as Boris Becker, Björn Borg and Monica Seles. Not all legends are available at the same time for all three platforms (including Wii). An editor is included to design custom characters. There are dynamic weather changes and the players' costumes show traces of grass or dirt as the match progresses. In the same vein, the player faces show how they are sweating after playing for some time.\n\nNext to regular matches, there is a full career mode where the player starts with very low statistics. These can be upgraded by training and playing matches, but they can never all be pushed to the maximum. Instead players need to choose to train for some powerful abilities or decide to become a more all-round player. This is mostly reflected in the amount of winners based on forehands or backhands for instance.\n\nAlong with quick matches, the world tour is also supported online. The world ranking starts over every fortnight and is not continued endlessly like the previous version. Some of the tournaments are the US Open, Australian Open en Roland Garros, but Wimbledon has not been included. There are various difficulty levels, six camera modes and the graphics are more detailed than the previous versions.","Publisher":"2K Sports"},"167842":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"NPEB01127","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bloober Team SA","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b57d45f7-1a71-44ab-9bbd-b601b9972ca9.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"992e53ca-47d0-4955-8391-86d865696d0f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac120eed-c588-4204-982a-3bdee7370b6a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88cfb2d6-cc32-4106-97b9-53ceb8446f8b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"A-Men","Overview":"A-Men, the military strategy title for PlayStation3 system, unfolds at A-Cor, the world's biggest producer of the robot soldiers, where a massive explosion at the factory has accidentally released hundreds of lethal A-Droids.

Finding the right path in these puzzles demands a lot of spatial thinking since there are different types of tiles that crumble, ignite or provide no friction and that way retracing your steps is not always possible. The ball can also jump to a skip a tile. Gravity follows the ball - so if it rolls up a slope the entire puzzle will rotate at the same time. This opens up different ways to move in the structures and from the early simple shapes it gets complex later on. It is possible to rotate the view or activate a camera mode where the entire puzzle can be explored. New types of blocks are introduced as the player advances and present new problems and increasingly difficult puzzles to solve. The 100 puzzles are divided into ten clusters, each with their own style and difficulties. The flowers that the player collects are used to unlock more puzzle clusters and to unlock alternative graphical themes. Each of the levels can be played in one of the four available themes as it is only a graphical change. Not all puzzles need to be completed to open up a new cluster as long as a sufficient amount of flowers has been collected. Puzzle Dimension has audiovisuals that blend between a retro and new style. When the player advances through a puzzle graphics change from pixel-blocks to detailed blocks and the music blends from 8-bit retro to new high quality tunes.","Publisher":"Doctor Entertainment AB","ReleaseDate":"2011-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"168065":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tecmo","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"cd6f1ed5-db73-4755-ba7d-ef6450f0f6cf.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"94b1a8e2-6e21-46f7-8cee-61ca0ac557c3.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1ff7d168-55ae-4c37-ba2d-c8683f333d0a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Puzzlegeddon","Overview":"Puzzlegeddon is a puzzle\/strategy video game, made by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive.

There are no scrolling screens, each level is a single-scree area where the player has to hit all enemies on the screen which may include clowns, riot police and more. Each ball bounces off of solid walls and disappears after certain number of bounces or traveling length. Not all targets can be hit in a straight line, and some may even require you to use the environment to your advantage, such as breakable glass, explosive crates, and other objects of interest. Each level score is rated in the number of balls you've spent in order to complete the level. When you lose all the balls without taking down all your opponents, the level forces you to retry. You can leave it for later, though, and tackle any other level on the world map that is adjacent to any of your cleared area. After beating all the matches on the map area, new area will get unlocked with different type of opponents and interactive objects.

It was produced in commemoration of the Sonic series' 15th anniversary, and intended as a reboot for the seventh generation video game consoles. Players control Sonic, Shadow, and new character Silver, who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by Doctor Eggman. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete levels, explore hub worlds and fight bosses to advance the story. In multiplayer modes, players can work cooperatively to collect Chaos Emeralds or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of superhero films like Batman Begins, hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, Prope, and the team split to work on the Wii game Sonic and the Secret Rings (2007). As a result, Sonic the Hedgehog was rushed so it could release in time for the holiday season. It was released for Xbox 360 in November 2006 and for PlayStation 3 the following month. Versions for Wii and Windows were canceled. Downloadable content featuring new single-player modes was released in 2007.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was a critical failure. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted Sonic the Hedgehog from retailers, following its decision to remove all Sonic games with below-average Metacritic scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters. \n\nPlayStation 3 release dates:\nJP: December 21, 2006\nNA: January 30, 2007\nPAL: March 23, 2007","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2006-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(2006_video_game)"},"168224":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acquire","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"24016be0-1aa1-46e3-9e4c-97248436e862.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59c2f36c-ed63-4e13-a89f-53c1d63ea466.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3990ac1b-e8cf-468c-9c29-844c68e23c9e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4f79c7d6-ffc3-47c9-bece-4333ed31064e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Way of the Samurai 4","Overview":"Way of the Samurai 4 (侍道4, Samurai Dou 4) is a video game developed by Acquire and published by Spike for the PlayStation 3. It was released in Japan on March 3, 2011.\n\nEndings, Events, and Customization\nAcquire promised that 4 would be much longer than previous games, and there are 10 endings. The game also features flexible events and cutscenes such as deciding whether you want to explore a cave or just turn around and walk away. Events are easier to follow, compared to previous games. There are more customization options than in the last game, allowing to choose features such as face, hair, clothing, footwear and accessories.\n\nHealth and Energy\nAn energy meter is added in this installment. It regenerates life points (which are set at 1000) if the player is stationary or moving away in combat, and depletes when your samurai fights, nightcrawls, or is regenerating health. Food and sleep regenerate the energy meter. There are straw blankets in set locations outside (or in) the dojo, inns around Amihama where you pay to sleep in, and any bed you can stand on can be used to sleep and recharge energy.\n\nCombat\nThere is a wide variety of fighting styles and skills that a player can master. Swords can now be switched to any stance; and skills, once learned, are bound to the player, not the swords. Players then can assign learned skills to their own \"school\" of fighting style.\n\nThe \"push and pull\" mechanics in the first and third games are kept. A new special mode is introduced, in which the samurai enters slow motion for a limited duration and can slash enemies repeatedly, then he sheathes the sword and all dead enemies fall down at the same time.\n\nThe sword \"heat\" mechanics was removed and replaced by \"durability points\", which will drop gradually with use, and eventually weapons will break. This forces players to visit the blacksmith regularly for repairs, unless their weapons are \"unbreakable\".\n\nSword Enhancement\/Creation\nPlayers can go to the blacksmith and choose to enhance their weapon's attributes (attack, defense, durability), repair it, or appraise it. Player can also ask Dojima to melt a sword and then use the metal to recast another sword.\n\nThe custom sword-making system introduced in Way of the Samurai 3 returns. In addition to normal parts like blade, hilt and grip, players can also add a charm that will give a special effect. Beside swords and spears, pistols and muskets have been added as weapons. Muskets are primarily used by British soldiers.\n\nProof of Life\nPlayer's actions will affect the game world in the next replay. For example, if players killed a lot of town people in the last game, there will be more guards to hunt them down. There are many foreigners in the game; but unlike the previous game, at the beginning the protagonist will not be able to understand what they say (the texts will appear as \"?????\"). Players can convince the Shogunate to open a school to teach foreign languages, and later the player will be able talk to foreigners.\n\nNight Crawling\nThere is a minigame called \"Yobai\" in which a samurai can romance a NPC by sneaking into their home at night, avoiding or knocking out family members, and pulling out the right futon to find them. Even then, they will offer playful resistance, and player must try to throw them into bed. A turtle head will guide the samurai to their target. The player can practice \"night crawling\" with most male and female characters in the game, as long as the requirements are fulfilled.\n\nTorture\nOnce arrested for doing bad deeds, the player's character will be sent to the torture room, to play some hellish minigames with the three beautiful Kinugawa sisters. The tortures include riding a flaming wooden horse, being tied to a water wheel, and being pelted by huge stones. If the samurai survives the torture, the sisters will be impressed, and he can then practice \"night crawling\" with them.\n\nMinigames\nBeside various jobs that the samurai can get from different sources, players can earn money by going fishing, working as an assassin, delivering love letters, or by flirting with foreign women. The samurai can also play poker at the casino, and hanafuda at the gambling parlor.\n\nDojo\nPlayers can open their own dojo, take on apprentices, and fend off challengers. The reputation of the dojo depends on the number of apprentices, and their quality. The player can tell any of the apprentices to \"follow me\", and they will fight alongside him.\n\nCrossroads Killing\nWhen connected to PSN, character data will be automatically uploaded and transferred into other players' game worlds, where he would appear as a wandering samurai (NPC), and players can defeat him to obtain the custom sword that another player created. This is called online tsujigiri.","Publisher":"Spike","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Way_of_the_Samurai_4"},"168356":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Backbone Emeryville","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f18af61a-a4c3-4d8b-a48a-05e3dc4c80d8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0dbeca9b-f011-4638-88b9-c0d06d34bc0e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"fc160f55-61f3-4239-960f-c202bd582f4c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2008-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"168362":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"2XL Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"7e6b1570-9c53-4aa4-adcf-edc7499fc74e.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"feb974a6-0f9f-4ee7-9c2f-48414d800d46.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae62ff09-1e90-40e2-95c9-85d7bd65f824.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Jeremy McGrath's Offroad","Overview":"In Jeremy McGrath’s Offroad, players race four-wheeled 800 horsepower off road race trucks with tons of options including a host of tracks, single-player and multiplayer modes as well as a wide loadout of vehicle classes including Rally Cars, Pro Buggies, and Trophylite Trucks, all in crispy 1080p, 60 frames per second presentation.

To ensure that Faye's husband stays with her, Lilith has put an entire kingdom to sleep. Somehow, Faye wasn't affected, and now, it is her purpose to rescue her husband and to save the kingdom in process. The game comprises 18 chapters (screens), in each location a specific set of puzzles should be solved and a number of jewels located, by playing a Hidden Objects type of game. Those jewels do not assist in solving puzzles, but instead help to unravel the mysteries surrounding the story and increase the player's final score. Player can take his time while solving the puzzles, however, his final score will be affected if it takes too long. The puzzles presented by the game vary from classical inventory-based puzzles to mathematic and logic puzzles reminiscent of Myst. Another resemblance Dream Chronicles shares with Myst is its presentation, which is the same pre-rendered 3D stills viewed from the first person perspective. However, due to its casual nature the game incorporated a number of limitations to the formula of classic adventure. All of the game puzzles must be solved within the limits of one screen and player is not allowed to move any further, before solving the puzzles for a present chapter. Previously completed chapters cannot be revisited either, and all the jewels left in them are gone for good. Dream Chronicles boasts a fairy-tale approach to its artwork and music, trying to create an interesting and gripping story through the series of visions, diary entries and various comments on the events by the game's protagonist.","Publisher":"Hudson Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-23T00:00:00-08:00"},"169099":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pixel Opus","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"34e9abc0-d3c0-4880-832c-653ace4477d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d6719b68-3db5-4b6e-a905-db8fa80791ae.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0b1e21c-3118-481b-9123-63bb4060292b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Entwined","Overview":"Entwined is a beautiful game about a bird and a fish that are in love but can’t be together.

The player guides a skateboarder through different levels with many objectives to complete, such as reaching a certain score, performing a specific trick, catching air, pushing a limited amount of times, grinding specific objects, or getting certain landings. There are no enemies in the environment, so the focus is entirely on solo play performing tricks by jumping, doing spins, grabs, slides, flips, kicks, etc. The skater moves forward automatically and the player uses keys or buttons to spin left or right, jump, perform tricks, and also a key or button to control the landing. The amount of buttons is limited, but timing is important. Tricks can be linked together into combos.\n\nThe game has a minimalist look reminiscent of Canabalt. Messages in coloured boxes appear at the bottom screen for each trick or objective completed. Tracks have a limited distance and objectives need to be completed in the provided distance, but multiple objectives can be split over multiple sessions. There are five different environments (urban, junkyard, port, base, and neon city) with ten levels each. These are split up in five amateur and five pro levels, each with five objectives. Pro levels have more difficult objectives, for instance grabbing a certain item along the way. Later levels have more obstacles and hazards. Next to the career mode there is a spots mode. A spot is unlocked each time a level is completed. The spots mode is similar to the career mode, but requires a single, huge, uninterrupted combo to complete the challenge in a confined area. A third RAD Mode is initially locked. This mode offer challenges that can only be completed with perfect landings and grinds.\n\nThe game keeps track of the best times. There is a daily grind mode where players worldwide compete against each other on a new spot every day to get the highest score, but there is only one chance to compete per day. There are leaderboards (global and friends) and a tricktionary where all possible tricks are stored. The game also includes a tutorial.","Publisher":"roll7","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"169116":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Yuke's","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f719f40d-8e27-478e-bc51-b440f2b37b5c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"248dee73-d4d6-4da9-8359-391616e4b475.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1697400-0070-4edc-9fe5-563a569503d0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"849ad69c-440b-44e4-a0ab-5122d15c1c59.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Pacific Rim","Overview":"Action-fighting game based on the film, 'Pacific Rim'.

The game takes place over five aerial stages where the goal is to survive for five minutes (stage 4) or defeat all enemies (all other stages). In normal mode stages unlock sequentially, and each stage has a set vehicle and co-pilot. Upon completing normal mode hard mode stages are unlocked, which have hardier and more aggressive enemies as well as the ability to use all vehicles, pilots, optional gear, and co-pilots in the game. The player can also toggle flight controls between Normal, where the Valkyrie jet mode moves similarly to its bipedal modes, or Real, where the jet can bank and spin like an actual aircraft.\n\nIn combat Valkyries and the Large Varja units can shift between their different forms by tapping a direction on the right stick. The Queadluun-Rhea does not have alternate forms, but can still change between high speed and maneuverability modes. Units will have a primary weapon (typically a rifle), and a secondary weapon (typically missiles), a melee attack, and speed boost. Weapons have unlimited ammunition, but limited magazines, and must be reloaded when depleted. All units can dash in a direction to break missile locks by double tapping, and shoot down missiles automatically with the missile defense move as long as they have remaining Anti gauge. A Special bar is replenished by gaining sequential hits on targets, and can be expended to increase boost, turn melee into a charging tackle, unleash the vehicle's unique ultimate attack, or activate the co-pilot's special ability. Upon finishing the stage the player is graded on the number of enemies shot down, as well as time and health remaining.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182020":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Gekijouban Macross F: Sayonara no Tsubasa"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"00f024dd-d19b-42a4-9374-0f771cdf963f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"02788d34-9f85-4839-a722-e4f649affd13.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Gekijouban Macross F: Sayonara no Tsubasa: Hybrid Pack","Overview":"Gekijouban Macross F: Sayonara no Tsubasa - Hybrid Pack is an Action game, published by Bandai Namco Games, which was released in Japan in 2011","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182021":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"f1f67199-ea87-4715-b48d-6288a0496d59.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ead079dd-9b62-4cf8-bc46-5a914d949100.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b763375-2ae8-4c09-a4c4-4beefedfb116.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f1f79f65-4c25-48ef-9a74-f8c25226ff2e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ec9f3329-bca3-4c54-9d85-6eccd8380225.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2016","Overview":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2016 is a Sports game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2016","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/q6xULQYxGuw"},"182024":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sammy Studios","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"425c0a0e-2be8-41d9-98fc-f3fe55a2e734.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4c138615-e7db-4c88-9575-cd50bc70975e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ba3f1e8-eed6-4034-bf25-3311f555b9f3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4a02d02a-13a3-4c7b-a5a1-4e9538f15d93.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou!

The player mainly plays NBA games with real-life or customized players and teams; games follow the rules and objectives of NBA games. Several game modes are present and many settings can be customized. In terms of commentary, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett appear as guest commentators.\n\nAlong with the current season's teams and players, previous games in the series have featured NBA teams from past eras, such as the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls and the 1985–86 Boston Celtics. NBA 2K18 adds seventeen more such teams, including the 2007–08 Denver Nuggets and the 1998–99 New York Knicks, as well as 'All-Time Teams', teams for each franchise consisting of the greatest players in the respective franchise's history.\n\nA staple of the series, MyCareer, returns as one of the available game modes. MyCareer is a career mode in which the player creates their own customizable basketball player and plays through their basketball career. The mode features a storyline which plays out as the player competes in games as well as off-court activities. The creation tools have been overhauled – new hairstyles and body archetypes are available for the player to make use of, among other things.\n\nThe game's returning MyGM and MyLeague game modes, which task the player with managing all basketball operations for a specific team, were a point of emphasis during development. MyGM is more focused on realism, whereas MyLeague offers more customization options. MyGM mode attempts to introduce more cutscene-style interactions than previous games in an attempt to give the mode a storyline, which is dubbed 'The Next Chapter', similar to the series' MyCareer mode. Additionally, several additions have been made to the mode which caters to the NBA's latest Collective Bargaining Agreement, and the NBA G League, the NBA's official minor league basketball organization, is present.\n\nNBA 2K18 again, for the sixth time in the series, features MyTeam mode, a mode based around the idea of building the ultimate basketball team, and maintaining a virtual trading card collection. Players assemble and play with their team in basketball tournament-style competitions against other players' teams in several different formats. Assets for a team are acquired through various means, including randomized card packs and the auction house. Virtual Currency (VC) is used extensively in the mode.\n\nThe game introduces a new feature to the series, Neighborhoods, which tie into the game's MyCareer, MyPark, and ProAm game modes. In addition to allowing access to the aforementioned modes, Neighborhoods feature an open world design which players can explore while interacting with other players. Several activities can be completed to raise attributes and the player can purchase items. The 2K Sports Pre-game show returned with hosts Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal and Kenny \"The Jet\" Smith. While the in-game main commentators are Kevin Harlan and Greg Anthony with additional voices of Doris Burke, Clark Kellogg, Steve Smith, Chris Webber and Brent Barry. The sideline reporter is David Aldridge.","Publisher":"2K Games, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2017-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NBA_2K18"},"186163":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"WRC 5: FIA World Rally Championship"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kylotonn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"967e137b-5c7a-4622-83f0-565e545fb1ce.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"255aeebf-2a9b-4769-9a7e-31897677b710.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"7c80aa95-6688-47f4-b79a-0dcfda7c4bd9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"492430c3-71dd-4aad-b8af-4142d331a2d4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":8,"Name":"WRC 5","Overview":"WRC 5 is a racing video game based on the 2015 World Rally Championship season.

The game mixes moments controlling business man Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego Batman with an even split. The game is set in Gotham City a few years after Wayne decides to become Batman. He is already fully equipped with gadgets and the batmobile, assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth, but no one knows his real identity yet. Both criminals and the police are however already aware of his actions. The game starts with a robbery at City Hall. Batman is there to fight the criminals, but a superhero Catwoman he has not encountered before turns up as well. At the same time, as Bruce Wayne, he endorses District Attorney Harvey Dent to become Gotham's new mayor, much to the chagrin of the current mayor Hill. Other important characters are the mob boss Carmine Falcone, reporter Vicki Vale, police lieutenant James Gordon and childhood friend Oswald Cobblepot. The event at City Hall sets a lot in motion that involves all the different characters.","Publisher":"Telltale","ReleaseDate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189311":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Brunswick Pro Bowling"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Farsight Technologies","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"491a4a9f-58e7-4ae7-a626-27b9ec965a55.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"12fa5857-66fc-4791-9813-0632ebb0430e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Brunswick Pro Bowling","Overview":"Brunswick Pro Bowling is a bowling simulation game.

Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling for one to four players.\n\nMaking a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.","Publisher":"Crave Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189313":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fun Labs","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b335b406-d4e5-46d6-88b3-af38a02fa529.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Cabela's North American Adventures","Overview":"Bring your A-game on this hunt - you’re on camera.

The left stick is used for movement and the right one for aiming, shown through a red laser. The goal is to survive waves of enemies and space debris (mainly rocks, splitting up into smaller elements similar to Asteroids), but there is a twist to it. Rather than shooting directly, the ship can activate a mass reactor, slightly slowing down movement, but it enables the ship to gather a large mass of ions floating in the arena and concentrate it around the ship. These can then be fired in the desired direction and the amount determines the damage. These ions ricochet off walls and can therefore target multiple enemies, or be caught, before they spread out in the playfield again. There are no other basic means of attack, so the \"bullets\" are all around the field to be gathered and recycled again.\n\nThere are four main levels that consist of five stages each, along with a boss fight. Destroyed ships leave behind score orbs that can be collected. Certain ships carry power-ups, divided in an active and passive category. Gravity power-ups for instance extend the range of the mass reactor, while a shield temporarily guards the ship against enemy attacks. The campaign can be played in a cooperative mode and there is also versus multiplayer. Gameplay is entirely different in the latter, as the player needs to call on friendly ships to target the opponents, and vice versa.","Publisher":"Black Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BRnNCma4_X4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ion_Assault"},"189681":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f7419300-a012-4797-886f-a3809bc2c500.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"Juju","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189687":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"2f56ba29-ebf4-4551-a1e6-a36817294ae4.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"afa1c00a-84e7-4a8e-90de-fefdb236c5df.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5b1dd1bb-3666-4910-a883-78d80c861f9b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Joust","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189690":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"4d6e79fa-785a-47cd-8927-d402a1a586c4.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"Joysound Dive","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189727":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Giants Software","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"2ac6877f-a784-4fe9-9f1c-d6904c694f8b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Farming Simulator 2013","Overview":"Farming Simulator 2013 is the 2012 edition in the series of farming simulation games.

The six episodes are:\n\nGame of Thrones: Episode 1 - Iron From Ice\nGame of Thrones: Episode 2 - The Lost Lords\nGame of Thrones: Episode 3 - The Sword in the Darkness\nGame of Thrones: Episode 4 - Sons of Winter\nGame of Thrones: Episode 5 - A Nest of Vipers\nGame of Thrones: Episode 6 - The Ice Dragon\n\nIt is based on both on the original fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire and the HBO TV series adaptation. From the TV series it takes the appearance and voice acting of famous characters such as Cersei Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Ramsay Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Margaery Tyrell. It also takes place concurrently with the TV series, starting at the moment of the Red Wedding at the end of the third season and following the events just up to the start of the fifth season. It does not expand upon or contradict the TV series, as it focuses mainly on House Forrester. It is a family not yet mentioned in the TV series, but briefly mentioned in the fifth book A Dance with Dragons. As such it is a spin-off and does not deliberately break the canon as the book does not contain any detailed information about House Forrester, but it introduces the Forrester viewpoint for many prominent characters and events. The game is set mainly in the Wolfwood region, known for its forest and carpentry supplying the other Houses, and especially the fortress Ironrath. Other prominent locations are also present, such as King's Landing or the Wall, and many others on the continents of Westeros and Essos.\n\nThe game starts with the demise of the Starks at the Red Wedding, where Lord Gregor Forrester, a Stark bannerman, and his heir Rodrik are killed by the Freys. Gregor Forrester's squire Gared Tuttle manages to escape and returns to Ironrath. The young Ethan Forrester unexpectedly becomes the new Forrester lord and has to deal with the difficult new allegiance with Ramsay Snow, the new Warden of the North, and the invasive influence of House Whitehill. King's Landing with Cersei and Tyrion is introduced through Mira Forrester, handmaiden of Margaery. Each episode is split up in multiple storylines each with different characters to control. Gared ends up at the Wall where he meets Jon Snow. Ethan's older and exiled brother Asher is the one to travel to Mereen to find support against House Whitehill meeting Daenerys. Mira in King's Landing experiences most of the political intrigues as she is dragged into the conflict between Cersei and Margaery. Other prominent characters are Ethan's twin Talia and his little brother Ryon, Lady Forrester and her brother Malcolm Branfield. Information about the character is stored in a codex with bios, accessible from the main and pause menu.\n\nThe gameplay is typical of previous Telltale games focusing on choices and consequences. Most of the gameplay consists of conversations where the player has to choose between dialogue options. Choices are remembered and important ones are carried over across episodes, leading to branching stances for the relations with the different characters. Most of the conversation options have a time limit and if none is chosen, silence or a neutral stance is activated. For a small amount of important decisions there is no time limit. There are some sections with free movement where characters can freely explore to initiate conversations and examine the environment. Objects and characters that can be interacted with are highlighted with a white circle showing options. There are no puzzles, but in some cases it is possible to pick up items, stored on the left side of the screen, that can then be used in later situations. There are some action sequences with Quick Time Events. If these are not performed correctly or fast enough, characters can die and a part has to be replayed. Some other small interactions are also available, usually based on a dragging and holding mechanic. After completing an episode a rewind function becomes available to return to an earlier part of an episode and try new choices.\n\nThis game entry covers the full season release of the game. For PC for instance individual episodes cannot be purchased, only the full season. The PlayStation and Xbox One versions offer a full season pass for all six episodes as well as individual purchases. For Xbox 360, Android and iOS users always need to purchase the first episode and then the others individually or as season pass for episodes two to six. The Xbox One version also has this option.\n\nRetail release for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 consoles marked as Season Pass Disc contains first five episodes on the disc, with ability to freely download episode six, accessible from the in-game's episode listing, while the same retail release for Xbox 360 and Xbox One only contains first episode on the disc and requires the remaining five to be downloaded.","Publisher":"Telltale","ReleaseDate":"2014-02-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189738":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"23b30ebb-e3f5-4a4e-9dc4-ffc10d27ac93.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f30925bf-1d42-487a-964a-6906210c7d7e.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Motorbike"},"189739":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3aaee2a3-5d54-493d-b6a1-44333faf8962.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5004f3e8-3d1d-43ea-aed0-9d217aada062.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Monopoly Plus"},"189740":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"d39d8ee4-b238-4167-9270-deb9be7a8440.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"Monopoly Deal"},"189741":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"fe6cb482-83fa-4240-909e-d2f34551ecbf.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a60157eb-c429-4101-b5ee-a6d5ced20f19.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a5ce18af-4102-4064-b1e3-afa703bf2e1b.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Minecraft Story Mode"},"189742":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"a9ef1bb6-6cbb-47fe-9d60-fb16c94e2a29.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"Mystik Belle"},"189743":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"eb166d78-5916-4fd3-9b95-ce4cf57d67dc.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"MilitAnt"},"189744":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"665887fd-2543-4a88-8b71-ed5ff5f78353.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"Novastrike"},"189745":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"05dcc407-22a9-4aa0-a079-43211f3cbc93.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"585ffb6f-7c78-4c13-b7a8-3c20ca67ed94.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Nucleus"},"189746":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"25626fbd-6be6-4383-a283-1e50da60c117.png","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"Name":"Onimusha Soul"},"189777":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"doublesix","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"56cd9a40-c828-46b0-889e-e6ebd3b7251e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Top Gun: Wingman Edition","Overview":"In Top Gun, players will enroll in the Top Gun Academy as Maverick with their Radio Information Officer Goose to go up against the best for Top Gun honors.

These include ladders for climbing, anvils to drop on top of enemies, holes that allow the boy to drop through platforms, and cannons for shooting to the difficult-to-reach areas. Unlike the original NES game, which only displayed each jelly bean's flavor, this version allows players to select beans from a wheel that shows what each bean does. The boy can also hug and scold the blob, as well as call to it to revert its transformation and bring it to his side. However, the boy will die if he touches an enemy or a hazardous object, or falls from a great height, sending the player back to the beginning of the area. The game is split into four worlds, each containing ten levels and a boss battle. Finding three chests hidden within each main level unlocks additional challenge levels, which reward bonus developer material such as concept art and storyboards when cleared.","Publisher":"Majesco Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Boy_and_His_Blob"},"191324":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dusenberry Martin Racing","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"d3e29ec6-03d1-4650-aa63-09b2d79237af.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"NASCAR '15 Victory Edition","Overview":"NASCAR '15 Victory Edition is a NASCAR video game and a free update to the preceding NASCAR '15.
