Certainly some of you also remember her from childhood when they were playing on the Pegasus console on the TV, and were battling tank battles to control the next levels. In our native country the game was also known as Battle City and was extremely popular. It was on many cartridges, especially on the popular 100 in 1 compendium. Its main purpose is to defend a small eagle located in a stone wall shelter. From the opposite side of the screen, the enemy tanks are directed at us. The levels are often reminiscent of labyrinths, but by firing from a tank gun we are able to pave our way and pound through the stone walls. If we break off all the attacks and destroy all enemy tanks we win the battle.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4P4n6Iappg","Platform":"Aamber Pegasus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Aamber","Publisher":"Aamber","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128745,"FileName":"648b13a3-eea4-492e-8fcf-56b834dc29eb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":128745,"FileName":"b2928b6f-3963-478d-a0fe-f971c44f2825.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":128745,"FileName":"270700b8-ebb3-4443-8b93-2293288176dc.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":128745,"FileName":"6e480896-89aa-4f77-bbc9-030852ebcce9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Australia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128745,"AlternateName":"Tank 1.0","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":130643,"Name":"Tank Version 1.2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Aamber Pegasus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130643,"FileName":"c239d313-21b9-4042-b13f-ed96bcebec21.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":130643,"FileName":"947e1b3f-7851-49f4-b292-edd0bc656ee4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":130643,"FileName":"7b4a5672-fcba-4c04-866e-a41e4fbd98db.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":130643,"FileName":"970b064e-1cb1-4a49-86af-69b59b0d1e4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Australia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":130643,"AlternateName":"Tank 1.2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":130637,"Name":"Tank Version 1.3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Aamber Pegasus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":130637,"FileName":"c90b1358-f147-4f5f-9c9e-51a1098da1bd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":130637,"FileName":"924a0a7f-4ebc-4794-9c32-6f93e558a5b7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":130637,"FileName":"7b9ce901-0268-4a3d-b583-b207c0aaa6bd.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":130637,"FileName":"87f69456-ed9f-4469-b3e8-aa264826a537.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Australia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":130637,"AlternateName":"Tank 1.3","Region":null}]}]}
