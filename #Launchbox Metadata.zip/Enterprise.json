It turns out that the source of the signals is a strange monolith. The aim of the game is to destroy this monolith.\n\nNodes of Yesod is an Arcade Adventure seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Charlie can jump and, after finding it first, use a device called mole.

Another useful device is the burrowing chum that can be used to dig through certain walls. Before Charlie can reach the monolith, he has to explore the many caverns of the moon and find eight keys or alchiems. Every now and then a red spaceman will show up, and touching him will cause Charlie to loose one of his keys.","Publisher":"Entersoft Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ATkbBd-skug","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nodes_of_Yesod"},"90767":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"771f1c8d-b3c6-49f2-99eb-de6517ce0cac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cba2ba85-5717-4774-8c26-8f8227ffd943.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"74d13baa-93cf-44f8-ac6d-d0b547037764.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Vixen","Overview":"Vixen was developed by Intelligent Design and published by Martech for the Enterprise home computer in 1988.","Publisher":"Martech","ReleaseYear":1988},"90770":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Virgin Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"7e5a3df6-09aa-4f6c-8b87-160d7d0d6a8e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"78154110-fc2c-4f8f-bb65-a63d3ef83b8e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sorcery","Overview":"You are one of the last four remaining great sorcerers.

He can sustain more than one hundred hits, but life is drained quickly when in water or in an enemy's path. Health also counts down over time, acting as a time limit to complete the game.

Fortunately the \"hero\" can obtain apples, cherries, cups of tea, and other foodstuffs to recharge this. These can be eaten immediately or stored for later use; however, it is only possible to hold one object at a time.
