To have any chance of this, he must locate a sacred suit of armor.

Once he finds the suit he can fly around the ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based themselves.

He witnesses the courage of St. George from Capadocia against the infidels and stumbles over a rock, falling into the Alcoraz River that carries him to the Monegros' Desert. When he wakes up he realizes he has lost his sword. He asks a farmer about the sword and is directed to a land full of ababol flowers. He is confused, but believes the red flowers may be tied to recovering his sword and decides to collect them, hoping to then continue his journey to Jerusalem.\n\nThe game consists of a single, large level that comprises many single-screen rooms. The player can explore freely as the rooms are linked horizontally and vertically. To win the game 25 red flowers have to be collected in any order and then the game is won right away. Sir Ababol can move around and jump. He has no means to attack enemies and creatures and has to avoid them. Water is also a hazard. Sometimes keys need to be picked up to open doors to continue to a next section. Sir Ababol has a large amount of health with a single life. He can sustain more than one hundred hits, but life is drained quickly when in water or in an enemy's path. Health also counts down over time, acting as a time limit to complete the game. Some screens contain chicken to restore some health.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Enterprise","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Platform","Developer":"The Mojon Twins","Publisher":"Ubhres Productions","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91629,"FileName":"a0948266-e9c8-4cb6-9808-2eccb1a712bc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91629,"FileName":"a936d0cd-89cf-40a1-ba31-16cb28f97373.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91629,"FileName":"bd54153b-b5eb-412c-9fa4-5dcb31a44f1f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90773,"Name":"Slightly Magic","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Slightly Magic was developed by Astonishing Animations and released for the Enterprise computer by Codemasters in 1991.

Using wire-frame graphics with a first-person perspective, the player controls the Starstrike fighter in several distinct phases: the first phase is the approach to the enemy base, where Outsider space fighters must be destroyed. The second phase takes place close to the surface of the base, where enemy bunkers and laser towers await. The third phase is a trench run, where gun turrets await at the side of the trench, and catwalks blocking the way must be dodged. The run culminates in the reactor room, where two reactor pods must be hit to destroy the base.\n\nAfter a base is destroyed, the game continues with a new base in the next level, with later levels having a higher difficulty.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Enterprise","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Entersoft Ltd","Publisher":"Realtime Games Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91914,"FileName":"eab123bb-2b22-4013-919a-a12d1ca2d7e4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91914,"FileName":"6a7baeae-cea5-479c-90a7-5cc9b7ef2ac7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91914,"FileName":"0406fe89-c4b8-46f3-b652-c507dc365b52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":91914,"AlternateName":"3D Starstrike","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":92123,"Name":"Sub Hunter","ReleaseYear":"2011","Overview":"Sub Hunter is a video game that was converted to the Enterprise by Psytronik Software.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Enterprise","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":92123,"FileName":"fbb887fb-150f-4bf9-aa9a-9701e9035fbb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92123,"FileName":"f014486b-5f75-4d4f-8b41-49cf96ace520.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92123,"FileName":"055e7466-1740-4959-85d9-10e8769aecb4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92123,"FileName":"790e0c1a-8667-4bd6-8577-dec97c70d56b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91606,"Name":"The Abyss","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"In The Abyss, the planet Nonterraqueous is controlled by a master computer.

Fortunately the \"hero\" can obtain apples, cherries, cups of tea, and other foodstuffs to recharge this. These can be eaten immediately or stored for later use; however, it is only possible to hold one object at a time. Many other items are needed to get past situations during the game, requiring the player to think ahead what to keep, to avoid too much backtracking through the 256 screens.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Enterprise","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Entersoft Ltd","Publisher":"Devonshire House","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95403,"FileName":"87f2a296-830c-4992-bdfd-f202b55eb406.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95403,"FileName":"bf35320c-9d7d-43c4-8858-4707dc743871.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95403,"FileName":"c12350dc-6828-46d1-b40f-76b2bf749612.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95403,"FileName":"e4ebd1b8-fc52-4cca-a74d-f0bef29770fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
