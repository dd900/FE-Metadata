The game's 12 levels follow the plot of the film. Depending on the level, the player either controls clownfish Marlin or his son Nemo. Goals in the levels might include simply finding the exit, finding certain characters or items, reaching a certain point within a time limit, or simple survival, like when Marlin and his friend Dory are chased by Bruce the shark. The levels are full of unfriendly sea creatures that shouldn't be touched and environmental hazards like strong currents. Simple puzzle solutions are used to get around some obstacles, like dropping a pearl into on oyster for it to close, pushing a piece of rock on a hole to block a current or flipping switches to open barriers.\n\nIn Monster's Inc Boo has returned to Monstropolis and it is your job as Sulley to get her back home. However, to make things difficult, Randal has destroyed her door. Avoid Randall and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) as well as other dangers as you try getting Boo home.

An unknown antagonist has begun scrambling the different universes of the Nicktoons, characters being flung into each other's worlds as robotic copies try to integrate into their societies during the chaos. Assuming the role of one of the main characters from the represented franchises, players are instructed by Jimmy Neutron to head to the worlds of the Nicktoons and use a specially designed camera to return characters to their home dimensions while also finding and defeating the robot doppelgangers. Players are able to move their chosen character around a set walking area to avoid hazards and get better angles for their free-moving camera cursor. Taking pictures of objects in the environment can reveal characters, and many characters require repeated snapshots to perform actions or return to their home dimension. Each level has a score threshold that needs to be beaten by taking pictures of characters and interesting sights, with many smaller side objectives like photographing a specific interaction between characters providing point bonuses if they're completed. Boss fights also cap off each world where players must survive attacks and snap three good shots of the robot duplicates.\n\nIn Spongebob Squarepants Movie someone has stolen King Neptune's crown, and Mr. Krabs is the main suspect.

The main game mode is V-Rally Mode. It takes players through a rally championship over seven different countries, with each country's course consisting of distinct stages. Stages are taken on in groups of two, allowing for changing of car setup and repairs after every pair. Car setup options include a choice of tires (appropriate to road and weather conditions) as well as suspension, steering, brakes and gearbox. Bumping into the roadside during a race damages the car, with body, suspension, brakes, steering and turbos getting individual damage ratings. The repairs must be possible to be carried out within a time window or there is no choice but to drive on with the damage. The game's second major mode is called V-Rally Cross and offers traditional circuit racing on five different tracks. Only one is available from the start, the others have to be unlocked by winning on the earlier tracks. Races are against three opponents and consist of two rounds of three laps each, one in forward, one in reverse direction. Performing well in the first round fills a boost meter that can be utilized in the second. Time Trial mode allows single runs utilizing cars and tracks unlocked in the other modes. Multiplayer is available via the link cable and offers two-player versions of V-Rally Cross and Time Trial.\n\nYou play a stuntman who has the task of completing some difficult and challenging stunts for a film director. Get it right and he'll ask you on for another project, and pay you big time. Get it wrong, and it's time for a career change. Apart from the Movie Making mode, Precision Tests will have you completing courses of varying difficulty, where you'll have to drive forward and reverse, launch off of jumps, dodge through posts and then park inside a zone before time runs out. In Jump Tests, you'll be out to grab letters while jumping off of platforms to catch them while airborne. You can also play against a friend in the various multiplayer modes to see who has the best control over their car.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Velez & Dubail","Publisher":"Atari Europe S.A.S.U.","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":172829,"FileName":"d986aec5-33ed-43a6-a20f-1f69fb03bc54.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179182,"Name":"2 Jeux En 1: Titeuf: Ze Gag Machine + Titeuf: Mega Compet","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This compilation contains a cartridge with two games based on the Titeuf comic book series previously released separately:\n\nTiteuf: MÃ©ga compet'\nTiteuf: Ze Gag Machine","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Infogrames","Publisher":"Atari Europe S.A.S.U.","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179182,"FileName":"520a2d9e-c0d5-4490-a439-b9f14752dede.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179182,"AlternateName":"2 jeux en 1: Titeuf: Ze Gag Machine / Titeuf: MÃ©ga compet'","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":127506,"Name":"2002: Kawaii Koinu Wonderful","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127506,"FileName":"bbe51d9e-cd6a-444b-90ad-2b70e23a218f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165577,"Name":"2004Mbit Competition","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"The 2004Mbit Competition is a homebrew games challenge hosted by Simon Band from gbadev.org.

It is considered the first game for the Otome game genre that can be described as romantic simulators aimed for women. Originally released for SNES in 1994, the GBA version came eight years later.\n\nAngelique borrows elements from different genres: Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), \"dating sim\", and (not overly complex) strategy. The goal is to make sure that Angelique has good relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the balance. For that, Angelique has to visit them daily, talk to them, and see what effects their powers have over the land. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Angelique - depending on the Zodiac sign the player chooses for her - has a certain affinity with one of the elements, and therefore, with one of the Guardians. This can lead to a love relationship, which will forfeit Angelique's chances to become a queen, but deliver an ending which can still be considered satisfying.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Koei","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34366,"FileName":"d04c337c-b133-4eb6-a947-bcaa9893341e.jpg","Type":"Box -

To make it grow, the player must collide his/her star with a similar-sized, blue star. Stars smaller than the player's star are gray-colored. Colliding with these stars will not change the white star's size, but if the player positions the white star just right, the gray star will orbit the white and become a satellite. Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel against (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects. Players must be careful not to crash their star into the red stars or floating objects like asteroids, or be sucked into black holes, which takes away a hit (and in the case of black holes, restart the entire stage).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Skip Ltd.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"5d23f143-c8e2-42d8-86fe-f9d6808034a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"3490cf02-380c-4b5f-84e9-75a3629bc19f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"e9403093-b05f-4faf-828d-07d4dc64b543.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"5b4ce663-2193-4aff-a466-8d6cbf5ec033.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"3ece1cee-6d01-446c-ba4b-2b48fc46f519.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"32353800-5901-4533-9595-7693ed60639f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"bc9e75dc-17c8-4ab7-b2e9-02021b824b9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"86a143a8-293b-47b3-ba13-72c4b02bbdd6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124360,"FileName":"2f4c1b93-2861-49c2-9f90-86b4b752a4fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123998,"Name":"Bit Generations: Soundvoyager","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Soundvoyager is a simple action game which uses stereo sound to achieve goals. The game is actually a variety of mini-games, which are all based around finding or avoiding something based on its aural location.\n\nThe most frequently encountered game is \"Sound Catcher\". In this game, you must guide your character left or right as you try to find the sound that you are slowly approaching. Each time you find a sound, it is layered onto a song, which gradually becomes more complex. After you find all the sounds, they fade away and you can choose your next path by choosing your final sound from the left or the right.\n\nOther games include \"Sound Drive\", which places your character on a five-lane freeway. Based on the sound of the car engines and horn honking, you must avoid crashing into other cars by moving into other lanes. A variation of this is \"Sound Chase\", where you must try and catch a sound that is running away from you, while simultaneously dodging the cars. \"Sound Cock\" has players searching for roosters which can be heard clucking, but cannot be seen. You'll need to move your character around based on the position of the rooster sounds to try and catch them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Skip Ltd.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"793de7d8-edbf-427d-89cf-cae67186bbf2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"76183809-00cc-426d-bd8c-83385abde1ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"25ae3155-4d7a-4011-807c-2fe5f3308087.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"702a9170-b2ed-4c67-bd40-5f9e71ba1eef.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"07f97147-a6c7-4336-925c-4f8109dbdcec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"d2e90f6c-6622-48e0-b0ce-79520c676a6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"b009f6c0-c29a-4121-9e94-cd61103e52a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"0cb437f3-7a33-42bd-b9b5-d979829f7b22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123998,"FileName":"79eb4df1-adfc-419b-98e7-8bd6ecd0abf3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25873,"Name":"Black Belt Challenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The lost pages of the Book of Zero must be found, and you're just the brave warrior to take the job.

The three Butt-Ugly Martians must stop him.\n\nThe player can pick their favorite Martian out of B-Bop A-Luna, 2T Fru-T, or Do-Wah Diddy, each with a different mix of attack, defense, and speed abilities. All of them are in \"butt-kicking mode\" (B.K.M.), meaning they don their powerful assault suit.\n\nOn each level, the player is tasked with destroying aliens and unlocking doors by finding the correct keys to reach the end of the space cavern where a boss enemy will be waiting for them. Various power-ups can be picked up to increase the abilities of the playable characters: extra fire power, extra armor, temporary invincibility, turbo, etc.\n\nOccasionally, the player will be confronted by Stoat Muldoon, an alien hunter and long-time antagonist of the Butt-Ugly Martians, who can be defeated by simply collecting a memory erasing crystal and using it against him. The game contains a total of 28 levels spread over 7 worlds. There are three difficulty levels and progress is saved using a password system.\n\nButt-Ugly Martians: B.K.M.

The mice and cats all move in predictable paths by always turning right when hitting a wall head on, by following corners or by turning around when in a dead end.\n\nChuChu Rocket!'s multiplayer mode revolves around up to four players placing arrows on the level at once, trying to direct mice into their own rockets and cats into other players' rockets (any cat that reaches a rocket removes a percentage of the mice within). Each player can only have three arrows on-screen at a time and cannot place them on other players' arrows or their own arrows. Arrows would disappear over time, or could be removed by a player placing his fourth arrow (which would eliminate the first arrow placed, thus leaving three).

Crash has developed a couple of new-found abilities this time around including a new rocket-jump and a super-slide. Gameplay is largely the same as other Crash platformers - run, jump, kill enemies, collect apples and smash as many of those crates as you can. There are 40 levels in this outing and an additional three types of crates to expand gameplay that little bit further. \nThe game world is especially varied this time around. The old beach location makes a welcome return, but Crash's adventures will also take him across ruins, caves, Egyptian skylines and even through space. It's a bandicoot-eat-bandicoot world out there - and a mighty playable one at that.\n\nIn Season of Ice, Spyro and his friends, Hunter and Sparx, are all looking forward to a hard-earned, uninterrupted holiday at Dragon Shores. Some hope! Meanwhile, a lowly Rhynoc spell librarian sees his chance for that career change he's always wanted. Discovering a transforming spell in the Sorceress' magic library, he quickly recites it, turning his slight frame into a huge mass of brawn and brains. Unfortunately - and hilariously for the gamer - the book was upside-down as he read the spell. Grendoc now has two heads, and what's more, two blinding headaches! In typical supernatural style, the only known cure calls for the wings of 100 fairies. He captures Spyro's close pal Zoe, and starts to freeze fairies throughout the Fairylands, sending his Rhynoc associates to collect the frozen fairies. With the last bit of sparkle she can muster, Zoe sends a magic balloon to Spyro for help. So much for the peaceful holiday plans!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Digital Eclipse","Publisher":"Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":172831,"FileName":"949250b7-b7aa-4996-8eb8-cdd53f68f6b2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172831,"FileName":"037d799f-3c8e-4479-97f9-613eea6cf1b0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172831,"FileName":"bc0500a3-9092-45cc-9e69-c5169398d0a8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172831,"FileName":"33ae80e4-9836-461c-a808-e8ede2dde2a9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172831,"FileName":"774eb9dc-4c75-444f-960a-47627f255c96.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172831,"FileName":"48f8ff2e-4380-4771-97c7-43fce632d5b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18969,"Name":"Crash & Spyro Superpack: Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure/Spyro: Season of Ice","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A compilation featuring: \nCrash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure\nCrash Bandicoot makes his first appearance on the Game Boy Advance, in this, his 5th adventure against arch nemesis, Dr. Neo Cortex. This time Cortex has shrunk the world down to a tiny size and it is up to Crash to explore the 20 levels full of dangerous creatures and terrain to collect crystals that will (hopefully) change the world back to its normal size.\n\nCrash explores 4 worlds, split into 5 levels. Levels range from side-scrolling action to underwater swimming and 3D chase sequences (similar to those in the original Playstation series) designed using the GBA's unique FX features to create a 3D illusion. You will also play flying shoot 'em up levels, a boss levels at the end of each world, and the usual extra bonus levels and secret items.\n\nSpyro: Season of Ice\nSpyro the dragon returns for his first adventure on the Game Boy Advance. This time, Grendor has turned all of the fairies of the Dragon Realms into ice blocks, sending out his band of Rhynoc warriors to collect them, and use them to stop his headache. Only the fire power of Spyro, with Hunter and Sparx on hand to help, can save the fairies from a certain Panadol future.\n\nUnlike the Playstation series, Seasons of Ice has the player controlling Spyro through an isometric overhead camera. However, all of Spyro's skills are still available to use, including his flame breath and glide. And the flying bonus levels (similar to that of the original Sonic series of bonus levels) make use of the Mode 7 technology in order to create the 3D like perspective (as used in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Vicarious Visions","Publisher":"Sierra Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18969,"FileName":"4700877d-e9cc-4294-b3bd-9f39be8d9d8d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18969,"FileName":"7848c552-d7ac-4683-8c5f-00ac8212ccda.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18969,"FileName":"e18cf89b-e1d0-4040-93c0-54c7265272cf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18969,"FileName":"0668416a-455c-4d2d-9980-048029ee443b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18969,"FileName":"201f51f4-5ea4-4dbb-8fa4-aadc8dc823cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18969,"AlternateName":"Crash & Spyro Superpack: Spyro: Season of Ice + Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":166542,"Name":"Crash & Spyro Superpack: Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy + Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"Crash and Spyro Super Pack Volume 3: Crash Fusion/Spyro Fusion (GBA): Crash and Spyro Super Pack","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Vicarious Vision","Publisher":"Sierra","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"d6a6c4f3-2967-47c1-825a-4c6bcc623d63.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"6e6ab768-c443-4e18-a99e-fb3fa3eb19c8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"d5b11f11-7e6d-43eb-8281-4f7597593902.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"07a92310-e83e-4c1e-8e08-1be44fd2597f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"7d4fa059-138e-4998-ad11-e8b091211243.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"774d587a-6740-465f-b92b-4181ac04c9b8.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"a1a7addb-0bda-4a0a-b43f-347a8cf70bfa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"0be5dfd4-01c8-40de-ad05-eae32a7fe8c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166542,"FileName":"d445dc0e-1a04-41d7-bc8b-2238d6c534e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":166542,"AlternateName":"Crash & Spyro Super Pack Volume 3","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":3360,"Name":"Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Crash is back and ready to take on an all-new nefarious villain.

They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge and drive the Special Forces towards victory. Fans of combat action games with a patriotic tone must try this intense game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"LSP","Publisher":"LSP","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"6a8daa69-5f24-4476-a816-083bc3234e57.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"a21f6c6f-7019-45aa-8236-79473b6a1a75.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"1e9f04c4-84a1-411a-a2bd-4106a86f7255.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"a094bf29-39c0-433a-9013-f98d81861968.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"f774088e-55c8-4a24-9582-80ef9f3e599b.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"86185760-a3f7-4dc4-92d4-a00bc818e2bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"2de67650-28c2-42c1-b478-0274d90a1de2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"98e6670e-36cf-47c0-84f1-fa4ca4b25316.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"08ac2225-10e1-4b08-a707-458add5adf8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"470f6317-7337-4137-8976-7c1ed323ba9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"84420047-52c8-4787-8271-c7442540df91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"ab941fad-2883-4f7d-9e39-264693b5da2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19438,"FileName":"5602b408-e8d3-4aeb-903a-29918e40cc77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":19438,"AlternateName":"CT Special Forces: Bioterror","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":3367,"Name":"Cubix: Robots for Everyone: Clash 'n Bash","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Something strange is happening in Bubble Town.

Once Kim acquires new gadgets and abilities, you can then replay earlier levels to access areas that were previously unreachable.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Artificial Mind and Movement","Publisher":"Buena Vista Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"034e2943-2447-4b8b-a8c3-dfb8784a22aa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"2cba9950-4e2b-4a0b-a9ab-588722ad7899.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"9b10632d-0d49-41fe-85c4-36da5b08a1fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"015ec013-c52d-4dbd-b342-6568785b494f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"03f9f8fd-bf3d-44a1-912a-02cd436da8c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"52720082-947e-4c84-a090-b2eb02f131c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"85ea8d25-1f02-4c84-8aae-cca5c6b8b2c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"112e15a9-af04-4ee1-ad9c-6695b561b2dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25374,"FileName":"eab91559-d181-4661-b20f-b32e3a0210a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":25374,"AlternateName":"Kim Possible: Dr. Drakkens Untergang","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":25374,"AlternateName":"Kim Possible 2: Drakken's Demise","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":3475,"Name":"Disney's Kim Possible 3: Team Possible","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Based on Disney's animated series Kim Possible, Team Possible follows Kim and Ron Stoppable as they battle villains, including Senor Senor, Monkey Fist, and Dr. Drakken.

An aspect integral to the Monsters series from the start is the breeding or merging of monsters to create stronger offspring inheriting the parents' skill sets.\n\nOnly released in Japan, Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart puts players once again in the role of prince Kiefer from Dragon Quest / Dragon Warrior VII. Like previous Dragon Quest Monsters games for the GameBoy Color whose plot took place before Dragon Quest VI, Caravan Heart is set before the events of the main series' part from which it was spun off.\n\nHiding from the consequences of one of his infamous pranks again, young Kiefer is whisked away by the goddess Rubiss, known from Dragon Quest II and III, to the land of Alefgard. There he meets the boy Lewin whose parents have fallen ill. To cure them with the 'Ball of Roto' artefact and secure his passage home, Kiefer takes the lead of a monster caravan travelling through the country.\n\nThe monster caravan, made up of the Dragon Quest series' iconic covered wagons, acts as players' mobile base from which they plan their monster hunts. Travelling with it consumes food rations, one of the game's resources. Unlike in the first Dragon Quest games, Kiefer can recruit monsters as well as human protagonists into his party which can take on various jobs. The monster breeding from previous titles was replaced by merging monsters, requiring the game's other resource, monster hearts.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"310f1d68-d918-4ca9-8409-3bbe8f4f5a83.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"b63532d3-56eb-4ea9-b15d-7676621d7d76.jpg","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"ca66b774-3454-4f82-8d91-30ed10ab479d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"e0c29751-1266-4ec0-a973-13b1d3890f66.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"6ebef1d9-336f-4c0c-bd65-e6f84d1be2fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"4c907d5b-8f63-442f-b8a4-9c46f8930a27.JPG","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"c1800ddd-3f01-4711-8a8d-6e1d51dec8b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"89217f38-336f-457b-8680-90cbbfa44179.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"176a2af7-b342-4167-bf13-28913a7c55ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"5683c245-8c40-41bf-a7d2-622b6414e061.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"75d63684-3139-491d-99b7-1c3dba6ef9f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"a2fd2036-9d69-420d-bf3d-d194fb17dd7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"8ac881a9-247f-43e5-9729-84911bae8490.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19066,"FileName":"6dd90c1e-0a89-483d-a733-dba0d6d0311a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3406,"Name":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Adventures","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wish on Dragon Scale and get whisked away to Dragon Land.

Games can be played in a two-player mode over a single cart and even up to four players with the support of a Game Boy Advance link cable. It will even support the Game Boy Advance's downloadable link for players without requiring a copy of the game. One of the best ways to play this game is in the arcade mode. This mode lets players use special impressive attacks when they build up their powers. The character called 'Vavoom' can set in motion a flirty ball that will dodge and sidestep swings. Droopy can blast off three balls of terror at once for players to panic over and attempt to retrieve them. In general, Butch has the most strength while Screwy possesses extraordinary athletic abilities.

Development of the game started in 2001, but in summer 2002 the project was shelved, even if it was basically finished (all the missions are completable), before submission to Nintendo due to Cryoâs financial difficulties.\n\n----------\nTrained by Gurney Alleck, the most efficient and honoured officer of the House of Atreides, you are going to become a specialist in piloting and fighting ornithopters. Involved in all-out war for the spice, you must surpass all of your flying skill to survive the fall of the House of Atreides and help Paul and the Fremen in their fight for Arrakis.\n\n- Spectacular 3D Universe on Advanced Game Boy, seen from the cockpit of the ornithopter.\n- More than 20 different missions with various objectives simple recounting, escort duties, guarding, destroying troops and buildings, capturing vehicles, collecting spice and water, etc.\n- 5 solo and multiple player modes (using 2 cable linked Advanced Game Boy) with various levels of difficulty solo mission, campaign, joint campaign and deathmatch.\n- The first adaptation of Dune, the most famous of all science fiction universes, on hand held console.\n----------\n\nA quote from the Developer (found in YouTube comment section):\n\n\"Hello!\nI never imagined I could see this game on YouTube :)\nI just wanted to show some picture from the NET and found out this gem!\nI share you a short story about this project.\n- - -\nThe game created by Soft Brigade in 2002 - a small team from Hungary/Budapest.\nWe had a very talented programmer VZ (Zoltan) - who implemented his voxel engine with lots of assembly code behind C code. (He worked on Nexus the Jupiter incident and other stuff - but later he left the game industry and worked on medical CT systems). Nintendo not shared every feature with third party developers at that time to make them equal advantage. He started to reverse engineering the DS and succeeded :D\nThe other interesting story that the official Nintendo compiler made slower and bigger code than the ARM compiler (DS had an ARM chip architecture) but for game release Nintendo didn't allow any other compiler to be used...(maybe for safety reasons - they have checked every third party code before release).\nWe had only 4MB cartridge space for the whole game (code, music, sound, menu, game, graphics, etc.) because Cryo - the publisher - wanted the cheapest solution for the release.\nWe used every trick to fit in (palettes, 4 bit instead of 8 bit etc. .... and most places were taken by the intro :D)\nWe all liked XWing series / Freespace and we wanted lots of different missions in this game too. Transport the spice collector / search for spice in the desert - red spot / defend the collectors from the worms and enemies - fight or transport / rescue people / patrol area / follow convoy / attack enemy base enemy convoy, etc. \nWe had one more programmer. He was a Bulgarian youngling Peter M who started help to VZ in the last 4 month - he made the gameplay/missions code and helped the menu system but most of the code was VZ.\nWe had an agile project manager Peter W - he also made the music, sound fx and mission briefings for the game - and his friend who was a fluent English translator to helped us to translate everything.\nRack - he came from a Magic 12 demo team - was officially the art director but he left the creativity to me :) he worked on font, HUD elements and he also made the code menu screen.\nI worked on the visual - voxel terrain, sprites, animated effects, figures, worm and the menu backgrounds, intro, briefing guy. I read the books in my childhood and i wanted a different style from the movie  - less baroque/fragile and more \"blocky\" sci-fi. The ship and building sprites was rendered in 3D - 360 degree with 3 different angle - a bit top, full side and a bit bottom to make possible the feeling of altitude movement. (I'm alone who still in the game industry :/  )\nEvery animation was coded. \n\nWe had only 6 month from scratch and finished everything in time! We were ready for the release.....\nCryo payed us in monthly milestones but we didn't get the last two payouts because Cryo bankrupt. They silenced and we didn't know what happened. A few weeks later Peter found out the truth from the net! That was October. Due to the protracted bankruptcy proceedings, the american publisher finally withdrew from the contract because it would not have been able to publish the game that year. The Dune license has expired in that year and should have been renewed for the following year. For a little game it would have been very expensive.\n---\nWe tried found other publisher and started to make some other demo with this engine - a military chopper game like Comanche, a speedboat game with reflected water! in voxel environment, and a car game... the time was short and the luck was run out...and our small company closed down.\" -KugleeKuglee","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwXEew58wV4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Soft Brigade","Publisher":"Cryo Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175410,"FileName":"868ed51f-966d-462c-a84c-3f978ac16d0a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":175410,"FileName":"6d3805a6-0092-4429-8958-024d647a3955.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175410,"FileName":"be8fe853-45bd-459a-85b6-c7a5cd4d3c23.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175410,"FileName":"ce89dbe2-ca25-42b4-9a29-7a7105e514aa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":175410,"FileName":"71391171-7114-4ac9-8a14-1a5e15826b22.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":175410,"FileName":"c96decfe-607e-4431-89a4-00aa2392b64b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175410,"AlternateName":"Frank Herbert's Dune: Ornithopter Assault","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":3413,"Name":"Dungeons & Dragons: Eye of the Beholder","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A new evil has fallen upon the peaceful city of Waterdeep.

Every single mention of any legitimate PokÃ©mon has been removed - including overworlds, dialogue mentions, game corner icons and much more. There are also a lot of more modern features and \"quality of life\"-features added, which I'll list below.\n\nThe story remains the same as in the original PokÃ©mon FireRed Version, there are only a few minor \"lore\" changes to accomodate some new legendaries in place of the old ones. But nothing that changes how the events of the game plays out.\n\nThe hack, as it exists now, is complete and playable all the way through. It's even possible to complete the Kanto Dex all within one save file, no trading or anything required. Not necessarily easy, but definitely doable. I have some future plans about adding Fakemon enough to complete the National Dex, but that's in the distant future.\n\nFeatures:\n\nâ¢ The Physical/Special Split including visual indicators.\n\nâ¢ Three new types: Fairy, Digital and Cosmic.\n\nâ¢ A ton of new moves. A lot of new moves from later generations, but also a few completely original ones.\n\nâ¢ A ton of new abilities, like Technician, No Guard, Bulletproof and Skill Link.\n\nâ¢ A ton of new items. Stuff like Eviolite, Assault Vest and a couple others. A few completely original evolution stones are included, as well.\n\nâ¢ Roughly two generations worth of Fakemon. The game should be completely free from any and all appearances from legit PokÃ©mon. 252 Fakemon, plus 19 Mega forms. Every non-legendary should be available before the E4.\n\nâ¢ Original cries for most of the Fakemon. 150 of them, to be exact. Not all of them, because I'm kinda terrible at inserting cries.\n\nâ¢ Running indoors! Best feature.\n\nâ¢ A day/night system.\n\nâ¢ Reusable TMs. Doesn't always work, though.\n\nâ¢ A system for checking IVs in the stat screen.\n\nâ¢ The repel system of BW2. (\"The repel wore off, would you like to use another?\" That thing.)\n\nâ¢ New evolution methods. Gender-dependent, map-specific evolutions, level-up while holding an item, day- or night-time evolutions and so on.\n\nâ¢ Mega Evolutions. Works ALMOST perfectly, and every Mega Stone should be available somewhere before the E4.\n\nâ¢ Extra areas added to Kanto. A few areas have been expanded and extra maps have been added to house specific PokÃ©mon or items.\n\nâ¢ Pewter City is almost doubled in size, make sure you check out the expanded area to the west.\n\nâ¢ Molet Tunnel (formerly known as Diglett Tunnel) has been expanded drastically.\n\nâ¢ Viridian Forest has been expanded a bit.\n\nâ¢ Eggs hatch at level 1.\n\nâ¢ Poison's effect in the overworld are gone.\n\nâ¢ EV cap at 252 per stat instead of 255.\n\nâ¢ You get the regional and the National Dex the same way you normally do, but every evolution is possible from the get-go.\n\nâ¢ Lucky Egg gives just a bit more extra experience. You can pick it up in Pewter City.\n\nâ¢ Life Orb works in the same way as Destiny Knot in regards to breeding in the newer games. I'm pretty sure this works like it's supposed to, but I haven't tested it thoroughly.\n\nâ¢ Flame Body and Magma Armor halves egg hatching time.\n\nâ¢ A guy in Pewter City will tell you the exact IVs and EVs of your PokÃ©mon.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/jLqG-wLhX-0","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Pekin","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2019-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"11974581-1c06-41e1-82e9-ad32d021de19.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"1715ed0b-37dd-4f64-b556-f752c8e5ba34.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"6d115f49-740f-4dec-b0d7-28290363c23f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"1eb23cf1-b39d-4a1a-95e0-6c8f99cf9388.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"c6a0f14b-3c0b-479c-88e4-f18eef3dc286.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"56722306-4f62-46dc-a334-aead4b2630a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"34921666-04ec-4ca5-a252-40486a97ed7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"bce44da8-030f-4bcc-a5dc-14af6fd98188.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"863f4215-1ab6-4de9-8111-9353b5e01733.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173891,"FileName":"df6412a3-5aa8-4246-b0b7-47d6f8d8859a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":178335,"Name":"Famicom Mini 11: Mario Bros.","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mario and Luigi are doing some underground plumbing when all sorts of weird creatures come flying out of the pipes.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"7 Studios","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"56b3c6df-d09c-41c7-bd1f-c0721b665b2e.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"823a11b3-1ff8-4d51-8ac2-30aad3bfccdf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"cf63624c-1a79-4e79-acc8-3bf0ecbd8977.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"2d22bde6-cb88-4124-af3b-a23b6502d304.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"cd603653-fd76-4d49-99df-7ab38a119ce7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"65a00f11-1fa4-4287-9026-47ee5fca0118.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"24ef6c66-ee67-4177-8b3d-35d92b85b3d1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"32286921-529e-4423-9cd3-7f95b23135bb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"f6febf9c-dc25-426d-a3fb-288a9242538e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"5383f7ed-381b-4fda-ad99-26170c83b2b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"788e1050-0b86-4072-baaa-5c506e696856.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"be236ee7-f9b4-45c9-afa1-cbf9d58d8fb2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3462,"FileName":"d322dd36-ad60-4962-bca6-6b9aa41b5d10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":3462,"AlternateName":"Fantastici 4, I","Region":"Italy"}]},{"DatabaseID":25928,"Name":"Fantastic 4: Flame On","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are the Human Torch!

The passing and dribbling controls have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method, called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes. Soccer fans will enjoy playing against all of today's best soccer clubs throughout the season as they recruit, train, and guide their team to victory in FIFA SOCCER 06.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLSKpd0jzCg","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Electronic Arts","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25925,"FileName":"27c57026-19e2-469d-8e2d-062ca9b7452d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25925,"FileName":"1cba03a0-28d8-4e77-8784-12f5da5b20bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25925,"FileName":"21b9f203-c4cd-4bee-8407-8740836d1d9c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25925,"FileName":"fb254573-4b5a-422f-a511-7bfa07de5b45.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25925,"FileName":"a94cb405-bef6-42f0-9945-22a6b99a6beb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25925,"FileName":"48d0bfa5-a66a-44e1-8ffe-1e427e7ffdef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28148,"Name":"FIFA Soccer 07","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"FIFA 07 (also known as FIFA Football 07 and FIFA 07 Soccer) is the 2006 edition of EA Sports' series of football simulator video games.

Like previous games in the genre, the gameplay involves large amounts of button mashing, but with added complexity.\n\nIn all events running is done by alternatively pressing the a and b buttons. In the running events, rising at the start and dipping at the end is done with the d-pad. In 1500 meters the d-pad is used to change lane and to a fast rush. In the jumping events the d-pad is used to do the jump. To make a good jump the player first has to press down and then quickly up. The shorter the time this is done in, the higher or longer the jump will be. In these events the player also has to pick an optimal starting position. In discus throw and shot put the player has to press b quickly to gain horizontal speed and then a to gain vertical speed. Pressing a too long will lead to an over step. In javelin throw the player has to press left to draw the javelin back, then press down to minimize speed loss, and finally press right twice to make the throw. \n\nThere are three game modes: championship, practice and multiplayer. In the championship the player plays all the events in the right order, while in practice the player is taught how to play them.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Athletic Design AB","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"bd260c77-8aec-4e00-9244-30b94bf511d2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"f0e599dc-894d-40fe-8aea-8a5b8747ac6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"6d673f79-90de-4417-bfee-fa08d9ccd81d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"e0d31d3c-3d25-465d-91d6-c77f3cc03920.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"756fd32e-b10d-4a87-a8e4-18b99027a2bf.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"9a091d98-b602-4564-a51f-612c5786003a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25927,"FileName":"c3feb17f-55a5-4901-83e7-6183b50a71c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3422,"Name":"Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Relive the first two chapters in the Final Fantasy saga--this time with all-new story elements and gameplay.

Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called Penny Racers and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. The European release is called Gadget Racers.  \n\nCommand any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Takara","Publisher":"Conspiracy Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2001-10-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"2455f8bd-dc9e-430a-a2d4-cdb294188910.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"d7485ab2-3736-4a6a-8140-ccdf2588cc0e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"dbd7c527-a045-41c9-9ace-4f328baa6a38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"890a795f-eb59-471b-b4e8-ac4b38e434ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"09be56a8-9986-41da-b73f-c9a7ae0f4e09.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"1e9f47b6-a221-467f-86bb-739960bd8e3f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"f82040cc-7479-4831-a753-940f53984350.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"c59caea1-4901-4e9b-91e9-669ee4f2c1b7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"fa9b52f1-25ba-4a6d-8a79-075e0ad6e49c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"7bb5530a-409f-4cec-a1fa-56fbc9100cd1.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"3116fd53-ad20-4910-9911-a4dbfb390e07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"07d490e4-c2fa-4345-b05f-be7e0f5636b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"1d23be4a-a29f-4176-9bef-2240490392c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"0e7ab960-882c-4269-b606-7a1a7a34e545.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"2ffb48e4-d5b4-4f2b-b3b5-e386aa7e8b27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25934,"FileName":"0f453b3e-50a6-4a2c-bdf0-fe0b0f7e007a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":25934,"AlternateName":"Gadget Racers","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"AlternateName":"Gadget Racers","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"AlternateName":"Choro Q Advance","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25934,"AlternateName":"Penny Racers","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":178473,"Name":"Gakkou no Kaidan: Hyakuyoubako no Fuuin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gakkou no Kaidan: Hyakuyoubako no Fuuin is an Adventure game, published by TDK Core, which was released in Japan in 2004.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"TDK Core","ReleaseDate":"2004-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178473,"FileName":"bddaee60-779d-43d2-9de1-263cec608806.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":178473,"FileName":"94b3e116-b375-4670-95cc-f55fe5f15ad7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176627,"Name":"Gakkou o Tsukurou!!

The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes paintball great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"WXP Inc.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2006-01-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25978,"FileName":"f945a33a-7784-4cb9-9aaa-84d18c22abb6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25978,"FileName":"2b2cf983-13bf-4e5c-aed2-37ed8fe3cdee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25978,"FileName":"73bbb8e2-753c-457b-a14b-8fd88a0afc96.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25978,"FileName":"8264b883-2362-4938-92a2-d915c63656e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25978,"FileName":"3fd8c81b-6d97-4a21-a8c1-4e8bb0355521.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25978,"FileName":"283277bb-5ca9-42e3-b68a-f10d7ab22c39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11550,"Name":"Gremlins: Stripe vs. Gizmo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gremlins: Stripe vs Gizmo is a 2D side-scrolling platformer based on the popular film series.

While doing this, Gizmo must also escape from the evil Gremlins that are trying to capture him and force him to eat after midnight - turning him into a Gremlin. Gizmo uses his double-jump and flashlight to ward off attacks, or can roll into a ball and knock over enemies.\n\nPlaying as Stripe, it is the player's goal to destroy as many presents as possible. Players can capture Mogwais and turn them into Gremlins by hitting them with a cream pie. Stripe can also attack by using his claws.\n\nGremlins: Stripe Vs.

The game was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance handheld game system. \"Guru Logi\" is an abbreviation of \"Guruguru Logic\", \"guruguru\" (ãããã) being a Japanese onomatopoeia for a rotating motion.\n\nThe game's story mode sees the Champs, small yellow bird-like creatures who attempt to help the inhabitants of their neighbourhood out of various troubles. To do so, they must complete a series of logic puzzles. There are a total of 335 puzzles in the game, and if they are all completed a totally different mini-game is unlocked.\n\nEach stage requires the player to complete an image by placing and removing blocks on the board. The puzzles are set up so that there is no simple solution; often the player is blocked by other immovable areas and so must improvise a solution by constantly constructing and deconstructing their own barriers. The board itself may be rotated so that the player can construct the solution from all four sides. An additional Battle Mode exists in which two players must race to finish puzzles in the fastest time. Battle mode requires a Game Link Cable and only one game pak cartridge.[1]\n\nThe game itself is best compared to Picross and Magical Drop. Similar to Picross, a board consisting of a set of blocks creates an image. Similar to Magical Drop, gameplay involves throwing blocks vertically into the play area and sucking them back off again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"2001-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32151,"FileName":"a619ed51-c4c4-4ca9-a705-b39195396290.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32151,"FileName":"6daa98f4-5cc0-4917-9f5e-8617b50ae200.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32151,"FileName":"fb74f72f-1145-4fd4-ac89-0ad59aa51109.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32151,"FileName":"ccf62ab7-8d4d-461f-8f12-129e6aa3a7ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32151,"FileName":"4a7e2c3c-d663-4e96-a565-eb7ce7919ff7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32151,"FileName":"9ea139d8-578c-48fb-9e67-7d8a465e056a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33243,"Name":"Gyakuten Saiban","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gyakuten Saiban is an adventure game where the player takes on the role of Ryuuichi Naruhodou, a rookie lawyer fresh out of law school.

During the trials, the player must carefully listen to the witnesses' testimonies. He can then analyze the testimony, sentence by sentence, and \"press\" the witness for more information, or present to the court a piece of evidence that proves the witness's claim to be false. As lies and inaccuracies are exposed, the witness typically keeps changing their testimony until finally the truth comes to light. However, presenting wrong evidence or otherwise making errors will cause the judge to penalize you, and if you've accumulated too many penalties, he will lose his patience and declare a guilty verdict immediately. \n\nBefore and in between the trials, the player usually needs to take part in an adventure game-styled section where they conduct an investigation, travelling between various locations, interrogating people and searching rooms in hopes of finding evidence or learning some clues for the upcoming court session.

If you crash into a spud, you'll lose one of your three lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3wWwsk1s1U","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Pukka Games","Publisher":"Bam Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2001-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"d4aa7039-c195-478c-a8d8-4c407c8e6a52.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"5b524569-9eef-4c91-b62a-9b4845b91cf2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"e754a9c0-79ae-4eb1-ba9f-c304b78048a4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"917f3793-3c5f-4035-83c3-45fb73c77806.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"2aac4797-742c-41a0-be16-d1eba96a06cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"760511df-cf1d-4f52-9aec-4dbb1c9c8bbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"04222455-f48f-421b-b068-a58c3680a359.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20879,"FileName":"fe8f4cae-f214-4de2-a2ec-e8f6e2e72744.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22630,"Name":"Hot Wheels: All Out","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hot Wheels World Challenge lets you become a fearless stunt driver and pull off wild stunts in the best Hot Wheels cars.

The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.\n\nEven though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing; Sports","Developer":"Silicon Dreams Studio","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2002-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"aa8c07c0-f70d-4768-834a-262c1c8874d7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"20072f24-b7ac-429b-a85d-219f4175b35f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"fede870b-a774-46f9-b89c-03f7a4779d94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"ae040601-ada6-40be-b943-cf11716ee95f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"9427a94b-0890-4fd6-8dc8-3890d8d7c885.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"7b6a6b0a-3fb1-48a8-81cb-457e5c87e96d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"9e720e21-2897-466d-9f47-aba2f6d9334c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"89b0e744-7489-4194-bba7-bbfe945d68ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"0aec4b51-6cd5-4dae-bcae-9b0c5cbc26a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"e5006613-4540-4681-8bc7-50025d038b73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8717,"FileName":"b04fe710-ef43-45e3-b6dc-982561b9e0d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8717,"AlternateName":"LEGO Island: Xtreme Stunts","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":176697,"Name":"Isseki Hacchou: Kore 1-pon de 8 Shurui!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Isseki Hacchou: Kore 1-pon de 8 Shurui! is a Miscellaneous game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2002.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":176697,"FileName":"bbd13f8b-89b8-4d65-8b59-ba92d52c379c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176697,"FileName":"82db9af0-a642-49c5-b1e8-e74eaa89ecb2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":176697,"AlternateName":"IKKOKU HATTORI: KORE 1 HON DE 8 SHURUI!

The pieces can be rotated in 90 degree variations, important to get these tiles into the littlest slots on the field. You can't place same colors on top of each other, but you can place other colors on top of already placed shapes to remove them from play. There are three variations: in \"Puzzle,\" the challenge is to remove all shapes from play with the set amount of pieces. In \"Wipeout\", you've got two minutes to remove all shapes from play with an infinite amount of pieces.

Juka can shimmy, swim, jump, and climb through the highly detailed environments. Plus, players can enhance and upgrade Juka's many abilities by completing quests and collecting the various items. Another feature of the game is the alchemy ability. By collecting the six different elemental ingredients, players can mix and create their own items and potions for use during the game. This is the only way to get many of the more powerful potions. Combat is also unique in JUKA. Instead of battling or using magic, players have to quickly match a series of patterns. The quicker and more accurately the patterns are matched, the more damage an enemy takes. Juka and the Monophonic Menace takes many concepts that RPG and action/adventure gamers have come to love and combines them with an innovative combat system and an unique storyline to create a game full of fun, challenge, and excitement.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Orbital Media","Publisher":"SouthPeak Games","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"30ca080d-332a-4804-a7d7-ab553ef2b136.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"65e50191-bb91-4548-a1a8-a6e89273b448.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"0284ff64-2647-42c1-a2b5-3af6e4ee3d55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"d19945f1-692b-44ff-9411-75b77e246b5a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"7567a28e-ca1d-4cbe-a8ca-5d9592f778e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"29c1826c-5e65-4ef5-b126-142e772267ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"1bd33025-c3a9-4e98-8c6b-0f1ff0e00c16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"3d1fa0c9-a3f7-49b7-9609-43a9ecad4cd3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"ef7e2cc1-6369-4495-b561-3f4913cf0f1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"104b0d76-7d3e-45b8-bdb5-1a1814cc4c30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14680,"FileName":"614c6caf-e610-42b7-a4b9-6d23e6a7218d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8382,"Name":"Jurassic Park III: Island Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"More closely based on the events of the movie, Jurassic Park III, you play Paleontologist Alan Grant who is part of an observation of Isla Sorna.

Of course, there's also the matter of the restaurants, shops, rides, and other attractions. If the park you create is too boring, poorly maintained, or excessively expensive, no one will show up, so you'd better use some seriously discerning judgment. In addition to managing the park, you'll have to pick up DNA strands from throughout the park to create new dinosaurs to keep the people coming back. Does it sound like too much to handle?

The biggest novelty of the game is that the player chooses two different mamodos to form a dream team and fight against two enemy mamodos. However, they do not fight together and cannot be exchanged during the fight and can only be exchanged at the end of the round.

Characters share a life bar of four hearts, with the rate of depletion changing according to each character (a stormtrooper will lose three hearts when hit by a blaster, Vader will take two or three hits before losing one). If a support character is \"dismantled\" by attacks, there's no problem, but letting that happen to the controlled character means a loss of stud points (the game currency), as well as a drop on the \"Super Kit\" gauge, which replaces the Jedi rank evaluation of the previous titles.\n\nGameplay has been changed to accommodate the lack of lightsaber battles in the later episodes, and so blasters are a lot more effective and fire faster, but have lost their \"charge\" mode. New flight missions are also included. These are similar to previous Star Wars games, like Return of the Jedi, and allow the player to attack both Death Stars, skim the surface of the forest moon of Endor in a Speeder, escape from an asteroid field with the Millennium Falcon, or draw wires around the legs of Imperial walkers in Hoth.\n\nThere are three major character classes: droids (unable to fight, but the only ones capable of opening most regular doors during story mode), Jedi (melee fighters capable of interacting with larger objects to uncover hidden studs and with different Jedi powers) and Blaster users, which can fire at an enemy from a distance, as well as assemble smaller objects (like short bridges or door switches).\n\nGameplay remains a light jump-and-slash isometric game, with the goal being usually to go from point A to B, while pulling levers somewhere in the level. Like in the first game, the game can not be entirely completed without playing in Free Mode (a near perfect run in Story mode will only complete around 50% of the game), as many doors can only be opened, or even reached, by using the unique special abilities of one of the 36 unlockable characters.\n\nTo acquire characters for Free Play, the player now needs to accomplish three things: earn enough credits (the value of each stud was increased 10 fold), complete a level (to unlock playable characters such as the level variation of Luke or Leia), and get all \"mini kits\" (which replace the \"Death Star Plans\" of the prequel). Characters that can be unlocked include enemies, such as the Tusken Raider or Stormtroopers, or heroic characters, like Yoda. There are also additional items to be bought, including music, palette swaps, new game modes, lightsaber colours and hints.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wJebk0aYvc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"cac3fcb6-71ac-4c1a-b926-359c62aecd80.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"50478fee-a0a6-4720-8abd-26c370b9a1c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"ae35a701-7d7d-47a2-829f-454cabbd4878.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"a5d64f2d-1e49-452f-a165-448f8a4e865f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"4288ce54-54c2-4fb1-9ce4-f05eaeb70023.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"30dfc40f-1efa-4a3a-b221-b882e0487b61.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"3b4fbef1-0a6b-4a20-b656-1383fa021ede.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"649c751e-1931-4492-ae06-6f67c1de6679.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18916,"FileName":"36ed80c8-8f18-4dbd-8a32-ffd284da6bdc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22262,"Name":"LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lego Star Wars blends Lego toys with the characters, stories, and vehicles from the prequel eras of the Star Wars universe.

The Penguins plot to escape from the zoo and, in the progress, rope other animal into their crazy plot. Like in the movie, the penguins want out of the New York zoo. As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items, and help. And along the way, they also intercept a group of four lost animals on their way to the island of Madagascar. Gamers take control of Private Penguin, who is assigned a number of missions to accomplish. He begins with a few standard attack and jumping moves, but as the game progresses, he will learn more powerful attacks and abilities like sliding.

Exceptions to this rule are: the love element (not stronger or weaker than any of the other elements), the dark element (stronger than all other elements except for love and light), and the light element (no weakness).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Brownie Brown","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"2c90514c-8a4e-49f1-90e6-7039a8d86edf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"213cd457-dc9f-404e-bf6c-e091ee55d299.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"a2c01470-7db4-43a0-bd86-c14106c49a2e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"c8cb0c0f-f9f9-46b5-bfb9-38d9230aefea.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"69bcc426-9e74-4981-aa6e-007c37734ede.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"ee0179b6-010f-45bd-910d-f06631464f93.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"c0e9c090-239b-48d7-9c14-f2dcb98671de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"57adb35d-dcd0-4c14-b51b-2fafec0183a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"c699d8da-b6e3-41ae-96c3-5021ff5b1a59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"bc606a15-693f-4259-8081-a3c486086686.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"f13dbb65-d6ea-4bec-87bd-71c6ae0cd84a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"78d93d89-fd7e-4479-9225-9a7a72944bca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123701,"FileName":"67a77200-281e-4137-87bf-36467212bc7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":178544,"Name":"Mahjong Keiji","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mahjong Keiji is a Miscellaneous game, published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 2001.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"2001-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178544,"FileName":"18231412-58a9-45be-bfb3-ec455783298e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":178544,"FileName":"d418fbab-ee0a-4313-bf67-53aabb86847b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":178544,"FileName":"04fde903-f56b-4ad4-92d0-fd9b33ec4c37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":178544,"AlternateName":"Mahjong Detective","Region":"Korea"}]},{"DatabaseID":178546,"Name":"Mahou Sensei Negima!

The game could also be used with the Battle Chip Gate, a Game Boy accessory that allowed players to use real-life toy Battle Chips for use in the game, a feature that would be carried over to later games in the series. Users of Real Operation can also play multiplayer games against Battle Network 4 users and other Real Operation users. Due to the Battle Chip gate being an important part of much of the gameplay, the game was not released out of Japan for that very reason, due to the accessories, like the e-reader not being very popular in the US.\n\nReal Operation is also compatible with the Nintendo e-Reader, which allows for the unlocking of certain Navis, some of which are required to complete the game. Navis also give unique features and mini-games to the player, such as NumberMan who will help the player study math problems, and each Navi has different personality traits to alter the playing experience as they speak and interact with you. The game also features a real-time system and on certain days of the week, tournaments will be held in-game that the player can compete in, or you can set reminders on calendars that your Navi will keep track of. Darkloid versions of Navis that appeared in Mega Man Battle Network 4 (such as TopMan) also appear in cyberspace for the player to battle against.\n\nDuring the course of the game, you do not actually manually control the NetNavis in battle like you do in the other Battle Network games. Instead, they move on their own, and you provide the Battle Chips for them either by selecting them during battle (in the same fashion as older Battle Network games) or by manually slotting them into the Battle Chip Gate. You can also alter their evasion strategies to guide them closer or farther from the enemies to set up attacks. This is to simulate an actual PET experience with the player as the NetOperator, and as such, no human characters appear in the game.\n\nWhile the game was not released in the US, hacking in Battle Network 5: Double Team DS shows that the game can in fact, be run exactly the same way as 4.5, using the same windows and such, though the player is stuck using only Megaman and whatever chips they start with.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSqpVCxBErg","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Capcom Production Studio 2","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2004-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"1b64b942-133f-4db0-b561-b56d1f00d3e0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"aa0b33b4-33a6-4f4e-81f3-166c16bbd2b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"fa77e6fa-84f2-4164-9c60-953acfc7df97.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"15df73ca-9812-449c-ac4d-2161124f13b9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"9cfed8a3-c073-415f-ad34-174ecef0b9f7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"69e20dac-91ef-45b6-b2d6-7955bd5ead3d.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"435360c9-37f6-4f7c-9757-f716fdf790d2.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"8708ba17-94c0-43d2-aeff-aca368d51d71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"fa69df69-500a-4108-9d59-510233bb5529.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"c97ebdad-829b-4827-8b25-3a77d1c15013.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":93551,"FileName":"11bd229c-0f87-4985-b102-51b3a7d474f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93551,"AlternateName":"Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":6929,"Name":"Mega Man Battle Network 4: Blue Moon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The fourth installment in the Mega Man Battle Network series comes in two versions--Red Sun and Blue Moon--each with different enemies, battle chips, souls, and characters.

Players can experiment with many different phrases for unexpected results. Two separate monsters can also be combined with special items to form an entirely new monster. Certain combinations will lead to hidden, rare monsters which can not be obtained through the normal monster generation process.\n\nThe Coaching System from Monster Rancher Advance has been dramatically improved for added depth in the sequel. Depending on the monster type, certain coaches will offer unique training sessions which other monster coaches will not be able to provide. These special training sessions can be very difficult and dangerous, yet have potential to yield major results. A monster's charisma and skills will also be crucial factors in deciding whether it is suitable to be a good coach or not. Coaches will now recognize and alert you to certain warnings which your breeding assistant may not notice.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Tecmo","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"3d57c6a3-7099-45ab-b374-ea653586d65d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"81dbcdb7-1d9a-4dad-9497-8b90cc68f9ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"3c6f2ca7-1914-4350-b913-f0b6976a0fc1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"e2bf5479-545c-4e74-996a-81858789ad98.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"411fb4b7-c838-44b6-a8b7-fa1691e8bfe9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"4c7b10e1-89a5-4220-a0cf-682451f69f87.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"187290b9-686b-477c-b508-2dbf911a0bfe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"3ef21c83-768b-46cb-857c-423f31186eaf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"25bc3f37-a13d-4dbc-b7a1-9e5af931ef1c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"6940a121-6c94-40b1-a569-5e601361b23f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25058,"FileName":"b65f6e26-cf8f-45e9-8766-da91d71f31cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":25058,"AlternateName":"Monster Farm Advance 2","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":178579,"Name":"Monster Summoner","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Monster Summoner is a Strategy game, published by Ertain, which was released in Japan in 2004.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Ertain","ReleaseDate":"2004-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178579,"FileName":"773a76f5-9524-437b-8c31-b8060d9f3f78.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":178579,"FileName":"34c2260d-b2c2-4880-950f-2eddac250dde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":178579,"FileName":"d0f10bac-672a-4a07-9e98-10fe34464669.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19452,"Name":"Monster Truck Madness","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"One of the best selling auto-racing games on the PC comes to Game Boy Advance with a variety of vehicles and tracks for the some stompin' good fun on the go.

You just shoot things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not.\n\nOne of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34873,"FileName":"7c1d1ae6-6026-4555-856a-23a019887b2b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34873,"FileName":"f6581f0a-d024-4179-9591-9213f9d46f1a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34873,"FileName":"0b645eae-09c6-4bf6-b6cc-3464c657e1a8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34873,"FileName":"3e3d80de-a096-4093-b0db-9b9ed0cdb11f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34873,"FileName":"9992951e-f760-42fb-8df3-b5ddea8165cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177160,"Name":"Morita Shogi Advance","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Morita Shogi Advance is a Miscellaneous game, published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 2001.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Hudson","Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"2001-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":177160,"FileName":"26424c7f-123e-4152-b5d2-6f14bc0d563b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177160,"FileName":"396128cc-42a7-4c31-8162-a041098d9ba9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177160,"FileName":"e0268305-4761-40b1-be39-bf747b294f59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22265,"Name":"Mortal Kombat Advance","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Classic Mortal Kombat action returns as you defend the Earth against the most lethal fighters from Outworld.

The core concept is similar to the original games: players race on asphalt or all-terrain tracks. The game offers different game modes: single race, championship, league and progression. The latter is the game's main mode as it offers a path for the three main racing styles: Cross, GP and Traffic. By winning races additional locations, bikes and tricks are unlocked. Each of the three paths can be followed separately, they do not need to be completed in a specific order. A fourth style called Ultimate is unlocked later on in the game.\n\nBikes have different statistics based on maximum speed, acceleration, brakes and grip. Some of the available locations include California, England, Kenya, Moscow and San Francisco. GP tracks have a set number of laps and an amount of opponents needs to be passed before reaching the finish line. It puts the focus on using brakes effectively to go through corners in a fluent manner. The off-road terrain tracks in the Cross mode are similar in concept, but demands mastery of power sliding to pass corners. They also have bumps and rougher terrain. The traffic style is a mix with both types of terrain, but introduces AI-controlled traffic that needs to be dodged. Signs above the racer show upcoming corners with a different color based on the sharpness and they also warn for obstacles. While racing a nitro is available to do a wheelie and gain more speed. It can be depleted, but regenerates over time. The top of the screen holds the time and shows a horizontal bar with the positions of all riders.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Delphine Software","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2002-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"6e07ff9b-cf02-4e80-939c-067a286ffd91.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"06f3e0b0-7e60-4fe8-9401-889c7979b916.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"8fa2f738-9e87-414f-9fb8-8d297ccbcbf2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"7798e2e9-41b4-44c3-9b68-641f53682b5e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"a1c30279-8f49-4792-8b1f-f45354c08b90.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"5d84b4f6-89ae-427b-bd38-84e3458afa9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"9d763f02-ce99-4b8b-84ad-ed2a30d4e6da.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"2d13696a-5e07-40e8-b44e-7de5ee041824.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"27199a9e-5f6d-466a-aa94-8a637c135c20.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"d8660b20-8c65-46a4-a5b6-c83a35eb0463.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17666,"FileName":"6f5c39f2-94e6-41ba-9f71-10d36e9ca236.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179185,"Name":"Motocross Challenge","ReleaseYear":"2007","Overview":"The game originally started development on the Game Boy Advance in 2004.

In the unlikely event that you should conquer all four levels, try your hand at any of the 20 mini-games that are included to round out the package. Fabulous graphics and classic MUPPET humor are ever present in MUPPET PINBALL MAYHEM for the Game Boy Advance.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Digital Eclipse","Publisher":"NewKidCo","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-31T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"91fbd53b-aa75-40d7-8def-9abb1664c9c5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"41284db5-271e-4852-b56c-b56171dda7f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"8bfd23d1-c77e-4096-9702-abd50580a543.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"4e26c744-a992-4305-859c-b777205a3de1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"bb8bdd4a-95f3-4372-a66e-4ff8e5173680.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"0915f7fe-cbf1-4f5b-baa7-b953eb7b160e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"c8b09d47-5c67-47b7-9bc1-81966bdef05d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"83ca4573-a38d-44bf-9550-60c215cbdd91.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"e378b014-7e58-4c93-935d-dee1d9f43dd4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"dd9250c9-f91b-4b09-8bb7-787b79288e5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"b9e5045b-78ab-468c-a36c-80c9758bcfb2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"39e9a8f9-d038-490c-9c8b-d8075c981324.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26054,"FileName":"6996f443-5b91-4f45-bb70-2d28735f7cb8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177165,"Name":"Mutsu: Water Looper Mutsu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mutsu: Water Looper Mutsu is a Simulation game, developed by Alpha Unit and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 2001.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Alpha Unit","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2001-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":177165,"FileName":"34796e11-d503-4591-914c-5190cb83e57e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177165,"FileName":"926ff475-ecd6-48cf-96ad-0451367b1aea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177165,"FileName":"46b06abc-8832-4b01-85bc-604d6362c667.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177165,"FileName":"7d6e726c-7227-4b45-b0ed-306d823b1e43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177165,"FileName":"e9662002-8658-4b90-89b6-2dac51ff0421.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26031,"Name":"MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Get your moto kicks on the newest, most advanced hand held system.

This game also marks the first appearance in a video game by the characters in RUGRATS: ALL GROWN UP. The characters from the popular television shows and evildoers work to move through a number of cartoon settings in order to solve different puzzles in this unique venture. Nicktoons characters are surfacing in places that they don't belong and confusion has followed. Jimmy Neutron, the boy genius has used his advanced intellect to come up with a plan to work through this strange situation. Jimmy has enlisted the help of his fellow Nicktoon friends to get to the bottom of the strange occurrences. The object of the game is to take a picture of each lost character and send them back to their corresponding show. Choose from 8 different Nicktoon characters to search through different shows like HEY ARNOLD, SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS, THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS, AND WILD THORNBERRIES. The game begins with THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS and progresses to the other show as the player unlocks the levels. Photographers are sent out into each show and the vertical scrolling adventure begins with characters moving onto the screen. New characters can be unlocked with enough points accumulated by taking photos. Fans of Nicktoons and any of the characters featured in this game are in for the most unique treat watching different characters interact in atypical surroundings.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Altron","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"630be8d5-798e-4524-8c4a-1807a033e47f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"71f1e0b1-1a9a-41b9-8f93-29d7885d783d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"6c81d810-75f9-4c39-a2d3-77c88f1854bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"1b34b332-e01b-4aef-9b69-84bc3974a476.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"a74dd4df-98e6-4cf4-a304-0ddbbbdb378d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"46b6a356-7493-4e7a-8753-e137e55162db.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"b5894686-210a-4682-a0b0-8f59ebb93efb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"abd28fbb-d0a0-40b8-bbb3-073f62d83027.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"46fcdb3e-8c40-4601-91a9-8ab5a99824c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"961c411e-246f-43a5-aa00-32dee53b79cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"8d3dd641-551f-4993-a0aa-7d91bd76a686.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"8c03c8c0-d265-4020-aa9d-bb4c41f3f7a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"42acca39-ba1c-4377-b20e-a305d0bda113.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26058,"FileName":"69cd05fa-2a7a-4b52-860c-53ffe4b2256c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":26058,"AlternateName":"SpongeBob SquarePants and Friends in Freeze Frame Frenzy","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":7517,"Name":"Ninja Five-O","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Take on the role of Ninja Five-O as he uses all his skill, stealth and magic to rescue hostages and defeat his enemies.

A group of aliens travelling in space get sucked into a black hole, which makes all of their machines go haywire. Each puzzle game is based around one of their machines, but has the same basic mechanic - you control a cursor which can rotate a 2x2 square block either clockwise or anti-clockwise.\n\nThe first (and most well-known) game has you fixing a microwave. You must shift the food into the holes using the cursor before time runs out, and if you do so, the food is served. Every five rounds, you get a difficult challenge where there is only a set path to move around.\n\nThe second game has you guiding a little white blob with legs. You cannot directly control him, but you can use your cursor to rotate paths in front of him to safely get him to the finish line. You can also make him run by holding the R Button.\n\nThe final, and most in-depth game, shows an 8x8 grid of coloured number blocks, from three to six. Line up three 'threes', and they turn into fours, line up four 'fours', and they turn into fives, line up five 'fives', and they turn into sixes, and line up six 'sixes', and they disappear.

Pinobee screenshots may lead you to believe that this is a standard action platform game, but that is far from an accurate description. Pinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air.

Do you like crazy? Then you can be reasonably sure you'll enjoy this, my second mini-hack and the only hack I've ever made that doesn't have the word 'Version' in the title. Marvel as a young child is thrown out of his or her house! Wonder as Team Rocket attempt to blow up Route 1! Puzzle at Giovanni's unusual behaviour! All this and very little else except a Cubone!\n\nInformation and Story\n\nI call this a mini-hack because it consists of just an hour or two of gameplay. Originally, it was made for the Speedhacking contest at the last PokÃ©community Get-Together, but I never actually posted it here, and I figured that since I won't be releasing anything new for quite a while, I might as well share it. It follows a young Trainer through one day in his or her life - and it isn't an easy one. In the morning, they're almost blown up, and by lunchtime, he or she does is trying to figure out why Team Rocket keep trying to blow up roads, forests and mountains - with the help of Giovanni, of all people. I'd give more details, but if I did that I'd give away the entire plot, since it's really quite short.\n\nFeatures\n\nPlay as a PokÃ©mon Trainer! Dress up as a Team Rocket member for a brief time! Catch a Cubone! Sorry, but there aren't actually any radically new features here. This is just the video game equivalent of an amusing short story; designed for immediate consumption and subsequent throwing away. Treat it as candy. It's fun (I hope), but ultimately there's no substance, and it may well rot your teeth. Although if you play A Grand Day Out and your teeth do rot, I will deny all knowledge of it and accept no responsibility.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/h-p27M30dFI","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Cutlerine","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173246,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon A GRAND DAY OUT","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173248,"Name":"Pokemon A New Dawn","ReleaseYear":"2015","Overview":"Intro\n\nFirst off I just want to say that this hack is meant to look plain graphically. That's the whole point. For reasons I would rather not get into in this it will almost definitely not receive a full blown tile/ow makeover. So if you're looking for a hack that is just all new tiles then this is NOT the hack for you.\n\nAs some of you may know, I'm Joexv, creator of PokÃ©mon Blackened Night and The Holiday hack Series. Long long ago, I joined this site to start working on PokÃ©mon hacks. After about a year of learning, I released PokÃ©mon Blackened Night. As it continued to grow and I grew in my hacking skills I decided it was time to write up stories for a sequel and possibly a prequel to the game. Each game being its own story line I could easily release and create them as I saw fit. It wasn't until I stopped major production on BN that I actually got down to working on the sequel as a possible project to replace my main focus. And that is how A New Dawn was born. Not only a new project to me, but a project for all. A New Dawn, will feature a revolutionary story line system that is created by you, the players.\n\nA New Dawn will feature multiple stories and countless side stories that are created by players. Any one can submit a story line or side story for the hack. Not all stories will be accepted of course. But if your story is approved, then you can expect it to be added into the game, one way or another. for more information on approval and regulations on stories please read the section marked STORIES.\n\nPrologue\n\nThe black sun. A calamity caused by the power of the Arcanate Machine turned Black by the Black stone. Team Night caused the Arcanate Machine to produce a dark light that would cause the fabled \"Darkness\" to rise from its tomb to envelop the world into an endless night know once as the \"Eternal Night\". Team Night's plans were foiled by a young orphan from Southfalls City who's family was killed by the \"Darkness\" when he was a small baby.\n3 years later the Altar Region has grown and prospered. Until one day a new threat to their peace rises up from the shadows. A threat with ambitions so high that it will reach the heavens....\n\nStory\n\nExcuse any and all grammar errors or typos as this is only a rough draft of the story:\n3 years after the \"Eternal Night\" crisis, the Altar Region has returned to peace and prosperity. 4 young adults begin a new chapter in their lives as students of the famous Professor Rose of the Altar Insula. Little did they know hidden in the shadows and ruin of the failed Team Night, sinister PokÃ©mon cloaked in shadows start to appear in the Isles. Just as the students begin their journey, Professor Rose mysteriously disappears sending the students' journey down many dark paths.\n\nFeatures\n\nâ¢ New Regions(obviously)\nâ¢ 2 different Pokemon Leagues, each with 4 gyms, and their own champion.

Everything you can think of â A.J.âs Gym, the School of Hard Knocks, the banned episodes, the singing Jigglypuff, the Pokemon League tournament â that you wish they would have included in the original games this hack has.\n\nThere are NO random trainers or wild Pokemon. Iâve done extensive research and taken some otherwise unnoticeable details from the show to ensure that everything in this hack relates directly to the anime.\n\nOf course, several things â receiving the three starters, the St. Anne saga, the Sabrina arc - will play a prominent role and involve a complex series of events, but Iâve made sure every episode is represented as much as possible.\n\nWhen playing, just remember that this is what youâd have expected Gamefreak to have made if the games were based off the show, instead of the other way around. That said, longtime players who remember the anime can play it for nostalgia, while newer players can play it as a sort of âsignificantly updatedâ Fire Red.\n\nBugs and other Problems (Original Version Only - Fixed Version does not have these Problems)\n\nWhen entering the St. Anne, enter through the right or center space, otherwise you'll end up directly at Porta Vista. This will be fixed into the updated version.\n\nAfter the St. Anne events, there is no way to return to Cerulean/Vermillion without Rock Smash. Thus, you MUST get the Squirtle before boarding. This will also be changed.\n\nThere seems to be a bug in the first round of the Indigo Plateau, where you are unable to battle the Trainer. Thus, this hack ends there. The next version (coming out very soon) will rectify this.\n\nIn Cerulean City, you MUST enter the gym and watch the show before battling Daisy, or else the Gym will remain empty.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/4THF65HqcyU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ice_nine","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173280,"FileName":"b5a9f71b-ce56-49a2-9b77-50cf18bbd1cb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":173280,"FileName":"7c0809a8-9038-40ec-ac7b-ed6186d04792.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173280,"FileName":"3ae577f0-9a84-42d8-93c9-6c07b3e7d525.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173280,"FileName":"b8ed88f5-3749-409d-8dc6-f6636274b574.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173280,"FileName":"c9670fb5-3ba0-4cf2-82c7-c915daff1ac0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173280,"FileName":"78e591f1-68ca-4617-be05-1204d80a2501.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173280,"AlternateName":"Pokemon: Ash's Quest","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173280,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Ash's Quest","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":165260,"Name":"Pokemon Avventura a Fento","ReleaseYear":"2013","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165260,"FileName":"cb3a7a53-3034-4582-b461-928352b692fb.jpg","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Italy"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":165260,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Avventura a Fento","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173314,"Name":"Pokemon Battle Ultimate","ReleaseYear":"2017","Overview":"As the game starts you will be given the basic intro and after that, you will be moved to the stadium where different kinds of battles happen soon.

Created in early 2016, this patch was never meant to be released to the public as it was a custom mod for a friend. However, since Clays Calamity II has been growing in popularity, many people are requested the first game be released.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nGame Story:\nIn this first ever open-world expansion of Kanto you play as Clay; an overly cocky and thorough Pokemon trainer. Clay has one mission on his mind, to contour and beat every gym leader like no one has ever beaten them before. He has a plan, and he is going to follow through. How? By being the best. Why? Because he can.\nHe starts his travels with a Magikarp and a Master Ball. All he needs in order to sweep every trainer, gym leader and organized crime syndicate in Kanto. He knows he is the best, and no one stands a chance.\nPlay Clays Calamity now and see how he does it!\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nGame Play:\nThe game plays exactly as Fire Red with a couple exceptions.\n1. The over world maps of ALL routes/towns have been edited for an open world, go anywhere environment.\n2. Gym leaders have increased in difficulty and are meant to be battled after all trainers are defeated. If you have played Clays Calamity II donât think this game is on the same level of difficulty. The leaders in this game are much lower leveled.\n3. All rival battles have been removed.\n4. Islands are skippable.\n5. Pokemon have been added to routes (all starters within gen three are available within the first couple of routes).\n6. No starter Pokemon from Oak. Instead you are given a Master Ball. Catch whichever Pokemon you want to start with.\n\nPost Game:\nUnlike Clays Calamity II there is no Post Game in this patch. When Mewtwo/Champion is defeated (because of it being open world, either of those could be done before/after one another) the game is over.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nFeatures:\nâ¢ There is NOT a Special/Physical split\nâ¢ ONLY Pokemon from Gen 1- Gen 3 are available\nâ¢ Master Balls are purchasable once at the Elite Four\nâ¢ Hidden passages are strung throughout Kanto (not as many as Clays Calamity II though)","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/muGiV3VnNKU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"frabulator","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173371,"FileName":"cafb0340-0532-4e6b-b45f-8c3b46f91c72.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173371,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Clays' Calamity I","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173386,"Name":"Pokemon Clay's Calamity II","ReleaseYear":"2018","Overview":"Game history:\n\nThis game takes place several years after Clayâs Calamity I, where the main character, Clay, embarks on a quest through the open world of Kanto to become champion.

To find and defeat Clay!\n\nJourney through the completely open world of Kanto with Pokemon from all three generations and experience the most difficult Pokemon game ever created. Gym leaders are the strongest enemies (second only to the Elite Four) that you can face and Pokemon are greatly versified in type and level.\n\nEvery Gym Leader you defeat will bring you one step closer to finding Clay. Solve the mystery and defeat Clay to complete this Pokemon game!\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nGame play:\n\nYou will start the game with a Magikarp and a Master Ball. This is meant as a means to capture your very first Pokemon. You may travel anywhere you wish (because it is open world), but the Pokemon in the routes around Viridian are the best to start with (IE, the original 9 starters).

The battle lasted several days, resulting in the destruction of a city and the reduction of Pokemon gym. Without the minimum requirement of eight official gyms Kanto was knocked out of the Pokemon League Verified Regions.\n\nOne decade has passed and Kanto has now been re-entered into the League. Gym Leaders have been re-evaluated and trainers have been raising their skills. Try your hand at this new take on an old generation of Pokemon; the conclusion of the open-world, Fire Red trilogy, Clayâs Calamity III.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nWhat this game offers:\nThis game, like the previous two, is an open world Pokemon patch of Fire Red. The available Pokemon have been greatly expanded upon and an attempt has been made to make every Pokemon (within the first three generations) available.\n\nAll blocked passages, rival battle scripts, cuttable trees, locked doors and trainer blockers have been removed, making this a completely open world experience from the opening screen. Travel from city to city on boats, by foot or by hidden warp pads.\n\nThis game, keeping with the aspect of the first two, has Pokemon locations based upon folk-lore, type regions, environmental factors (like moon stones) and level diversity.\n\nHidden passages litter the region and secret trainers wait to be found. Continue the journey and follow this story to the epic conclusion!\n\nChanges:\n- Open world Pokemon Fire Red (duh...)\n- Mew is now usable\n- Deoxus is now usable\n- Trainers updated (more Mons, higher levels).

The secondary goal is to make strong Pokemon easier to obtain and raise, by making important items more accessible, and by making weaker moves more useful.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nThis hack was created by me (Ravendeth) and my wife Taelle over the course of one month, for a friend who was going to go through head surgery and would have nothing to do while sitting around.\n\nFEATURES:\nâ¢ NEW TYPES : Many redundant or oddball pokemon have been given new \n  secondary types to better fit their movepools or the team niche that they try to fill. â¢ Fairy type is also implemented.\nâ¢ REBALANCED BASE STATS : Most of the pokemon in the game have been given \n  increased base stats to better show off their strengths, mostly based on their \n  previous placements on the tier list.\nâ¢ MORE ACCESSIBLE ITEMS : Prices reduced, important items easier to come by.\nâ¢ ALL 386 POKEMON CATCHABLE (75% done) : the goal is to have 6 pokemon catchable in each area, to increase variety and teambuilding choices.\nâ¢ TYPE VARIETY : Redundant types diversified. No more rat/bird/fishpocalypsemon. \n  Many humanoid pokemon have been changed into Fairy types rather than the \n  animal-based Normal type. Less psuedodragons and more Dragon types.\nâ¢ QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES : Reusable TMs, Rewriteable HMs, shorter annoying \n  texts, clearer and concise descriptions.\nâ¢ TYPE REBALANCING : Ice type resists Normal and Flying attacks. Fairy type is weak \n  to Bug attacks.\nâ¢ IMPROVED BREEDING : Any two pokemon can breed, like in many other monster \n  games. Egg hatch times halved.\nâ¢ Shiny Pokemon : Shiny rate is 0.5% (one in 200), making them uncommon instead \n  of impossible to find during a casual playthrough. Many pokemon have new shiny \n  colors.\nâ¢ Special Evolution : Pokemon who have trade or other special evolution methods \n  can now also evolve through friendship.\nâ¢ Catch Rates : Pokemon have a flat 10% added to their catch rates. Similar feel, \n  helps with sableye and legendary PTSD.\nâ¢ Surfing/Fishing : Surf encounter rates reduced. Fishing now finds non-magikarp \n  and 1 new pokemon for each rod tier.\nâ¢ Day/Night System : Caves also use natural illumination to make your nature hike \n  and evolutions more memorable.\nâ¢ System Time : The Gamecube at your house can be used freely to change the \n  system time.\nâ¢ HM sanity : Pokemon with wings can use Fly, pokemon with claws can use Cut, \n  etc.\nâ¢ Egg Move sanity : Many pokemon have improved learnsets with important moves \n  such as Will-o-Wisp, Dragon Dance, Heal Bell, and Baton Pass.\nâ¢ Run anywhere : Able to use running shoes indoors.\n\nKNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:\n1. Some pokedex entries are missing, seems to be a vanilla emerald bug? This will \n    get filled in for the release version.\n2. Old legendaries and sea caves, safari zone, victory road not yet finished.\n3. Brandon rides a missingno in the intro (compressed graphics corruption). Not \n    sure how to fix this.\n4. Ocean Route 124 (Relic Reef) is filled with Pupitar (L1-50). Not sure how to fix \n    this, seems to be a bug caused by the map editor.\n5. The important features should have NPCs or signs to explain them in the release \n    version.\n6. Some attack descriptions don't fit (bad linebreaks) due to the rushed nature.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/e80GuxjUMzs","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Ravendeth","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173390,"FileName":"cc5f2cc7-e75e-4863-99bf-23e0d5ed6c34.png","Type":"Screenshot -

having been worked on in little phases at a time, ever since I started learning about ROM hacking several years ago. Canât really remember when (maybe 2010?).\n\nIt was put on hiatus several times due to life-stuff, and a couple of times I had even redone it from the beginning to find and remove any and all glitches/errors; I spent most of the time trying to figure out what the most minimalist/efficient ways to implement everything were. Finally it's here, and as of the latest update nearly all of the features I had planned are in!\n\nA change-log (different from the one here) has been kept documenting every single change that has been made (as well as dates-of editing, revisions and future ideas), for the sake of being able to quickly and easily pinpoint the cause of any errors. Choices in programs and how they were used have been carefully considered to avoid glitches. I am also trying to keep the save-data structure of the base ROM intact so that the regular Emerald's game saves will remain 'backwards/forwards' compatible (originally for testing scripts, graphics, etc.). This may change in the future, but it will be on a separate branch of this project.\n\n\nGameplay/Summary:\n\nThis is largely a \"quality of life improvement\" type of ROM hack, and does not alter the main storyline. It retains all the features the original Emerald has, but adds several things to the mix to make it more fulfilling and fun to play. Remember those days when myths like going to the Moon after a certain number of rocket launches/weeks were a thing? Several things like that will be accounted for, but with some changes/twists to how they are done. There is a moderate increase in difficulty (not really big, just aimed more towards veteran players), but there are rewards to compensate.\n\nOnly a select few newer-generation features have been added, as I wanted to keep this hackâs gameplay as faithful to the pre-2007 scene as possible while still adding a few of the newer gamesâ improvements in function. However, I might add in a few newer-generation PokÃ©mon as special appearances/events sometime in the distant future. Apparently, expanding the PokÃ©Dex could cause the game to require its own exclusive saves only, but I think that will be OK as long as one does not plan on using this hack's saves with the regular Emerald (or vice-versa, I think). You may want to also keep in mind that if I happen to release an expanded-Dex version at some point, it may not be compatible with a save file from the regular version of this hack. Regardless, I will not stop updating the regular one and will still release it as well if that is the case. I would also try to find a way to make the original saves compatible with the new one.\n\nMain Features:\n\nâ² The PRNG glitch has been fixed by re-incorporating Emeraldâs unused PRNG system.\nâ¢ May need someone to check this one, just to fully confirm that it has been implemented properly.\n\nâ² All 386 Gen 1-3 PokÃ©mon available.\nâ¢ A New Evo Stone that evolves Trade-Evo PokÃ©mon.\nâ¢ More Roaming Legendaries, events, different sprites, etc.\n--- Some events based on Day/Night/etc and/or game completion status.\nâ¢ PokÃ©mon from different PokÃ©Dex sections have their own battle music (based on region/availability in-game).\n--- i.e. Encounter a wild Pidgey somewhere, it will play Kantoâs Wild Battle theme; while Sentret has an exclusive Johto Wild Battle remix.\nâ¢ Most events/Legendaries have signature themes too (i.e. Suicune and its Crystal battle theme), though related ones share themes.\nâ¢ A special Event-Shiny somewhere.\nâ¢ Check the Game Corner prizes in Mauville City for a few surprises.\nâ¢ Mirage Island can now be reached in a much better (and honestly much more sane) way than in the original R/S/E.\n--- Available on Sunday mornings after capturing 180+ National Dex PokÃ©mon. The National Dex always includes Hoenn PokÃ©mon as well.\n\nâ² Special Event Tickets are available via unlocking Mystery Gift and finding the MG Receptionist upstairs in all PokÃ©mon Centers.\nâ¢ Obtaining the Nintendo Event Tickets in this hack uses the real Mystery Gift scripts that legitimately unlock them! :)\nâ¢ Mystery Gift is unlocked the same way as normal: Fill out the questionnaire in a PokÃ©Mart with \"LINK TOGETHER WITH ALL\".\nâ¢ How to obtain them this time:\n--- Eon Ticket: Become the Hoenn League Champion.\n--- AuroraTicket: Defeat Steven at least once.\n--- MysticTicket: Raikou, Entei and Suicune all defeated/fled from or captured (Like w/Crystal Version's Ho-oh, but more lenient).\n--- Old Sea Map: Get 180+ National Dex captures.\n\nâ² Day & Night System (Early-Morning, Morning, Day, Afternoon, Twilight, Evening).\nâ¢ Affects battles too, and will eventually affect music on maps in a future update.\n\nâ² Graphics have been altered in many different areas/aspects (nothing too fancy, but it is an improvement IMO).\nâ¢ (i.e. Meteor Falls looks very different now, many menus are new colors, trees/caves different texture, etc).\nâ¢ New Battle Backgrounds based off of HG/SSâs and recolored to match CosmicEmerald's altered environments.\n--- The tiled indoor trainer battle style and the Champion one were designed by me using Paint.\nâ¢ Edited Rayquazaâs backsprite so that its lower âfinâ points backwards instead of oddly forward.\nâ¢ New (but still similar) Title Screen!\nâ¢ You may find that certain maps look quite a lot different than they were previously.\n\nâ² Upgraded B/W Repel System (lets you choose whether to use another and which type).\n\nâ² TMs are reusable.\n\nâ² All PokÃ©balls (except Safari Balls) are reusable until capture.\nâ¢ Are slightly less common and cost quite a bit more for balanceâs sake.\nâ¢ No more worry about resets, savestate-abuse or running out of chances to capture a Shiny.\n\nâ² Your PokÃ©mon receive EXP when you capture another, like at the end of a normal battle.\n\nâ² PokÃ©monâs Natures have color-coded stat boosts/drops.\n\nâ² Rough Skin Ability Fix (from Gen IV).\n\nâ² EVs cap at 252 instead of 255 (in order to not waste remainder points).\n\nâ² Somewhat steeper difficulty curve than official games.\nâ¢ Storyline-based/secret trainers are stronger, Event-Legendaries stronger, etc), but nothing too insane.\n\nâ² Running While Indoors.\n\nâ² Final Trainer Card is no longer Gold, but is âPlatinumâ (well, not that literally, but itâs totally different than before).\n\nâ² Upgraded EXP system: All PokÃ©mon directly participating in a battle will receive full EXP, not half unless you use EXP Share to avoid having to switch them out. This allows you to have more options for how to train.\n\nâ² Steven can now be re-matched daily, and depending on when you face him, the Champion Battle theme might play (like in R/S).\n\nâ² It is now possible to \"turn off\" the random calls on the PokÃ©Nav (except for the scripted ones in the story) by using Prof. Birch's machine in the lab.\n\nâ² The clock in the player's room now lets you know what the day of the week is before showing the time (there is a minor bug on the Playstation Portable). Because of this, it can now help you know if the in-game day is correct when you want to do a special Event!\n\nâ² The Safari Zone's expansion area is now split between nocturnal and diurnal Johto PokÃ©mon (North and South, respectively).\n\nâ² The bed in the player's room can now be used for sleeping, and possibly investigating a 'nightmare'.\n\nâ² Lamps on maps that have them now have a lit/glowing animation during night hours.\nâ¢ Mt. Chimney's lava is also lit up at night.\n\nâ² Features 4 new RSE-style music remixes I made (3 from G/S/C), + 2 hidden Crystal-Version tracks from the original.\n\nâ² As another special feature for this ROM hack: Rayquaza and Jirachi have a 1/200 Shiny chance.\n\nâ² A few Legendaries' movesets are very slightly different, for event battle purposes.

He would spend countless hours with his pokemon, days even, just feeding them, playing with them, and caring for their wounds. One day, he found a weak Marowak; a wounded one that, as time went on, he grew more and more attached to. Being as fond of caregiving as he was, the caregiver discovered medicine that was helpful for curing pokemon, as well as others that weren't so effective.\n\nThe man eventually came upon a terribly wounded Charmander. The pokemon demanded much of his time thanks to its condition, and as a result, the Marowak, who had grown strong thanks to the care and nurturing of the caregiver, felt that it had taken a backseat to the Charmander. It felt that it was being rejected. With sadness and regret in its heart, it began to isolate itself from the other pokemon.\n\nCharmander soon recovered thanks to the aid of the caregiver, and the Marowak felt a massive amount of resentment towards it, distancing itself from the caregiver. The resentment grew to the point where Marowak couldn't take it anymore. It confronted the Charmander and the two battled brutally and mercilessly. Marowak had the upperhand, and as it was ready to send Charmander the killing blow, the caregiver swept the Charmander up. This was the final nail in the coffin for Marowak, it no longer had a place in the caregivers heart. Realizing this, the Marowak fled the farm.\n\n...\n\nYears passed. The caregiver went on as he previously did, though his heart was still heavy under the weight of Marowak's departure. Then, one day, he noticed the headline in a newspaper.\n\n\"Rogue Marowak Causes Fear Throughout Region\"\n\nThe article went on to describe the acts of terror that it enacted. The caregiver was sure that the Marowak described was the same Marowak that had fled the farm all those years ago. He needed to go. He made to leave the farm and go to the last reported place that the Marowak has appeared. However, he wasn't given the time to leave. The Marowak had returned, and it darted towards the farm. It stopped just short of the farm gate, tired and angry, collapsing out of fatigue.\n\nIt was incapacitated for many days, but after a time, it recovered. There was no time for any sort reunion, however, as police arrived at the farmhouse with a warrant for the Marowak. The caregiver tried to keep the pokemon safe, but due to his aide he was arrested for being an accomplice. The Marowak, however, managed to escape, and it did not forget what the caregiver had done for it. A week after the incident, along with a fellow Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee, the Marowak overran the jail, successfully saving and hiding the caregiver. Thus seemingly ending the tale of the caregiver...?\n\nYears have passed and the region has seen massive change. The government has been reformed, and lately you seem to notice that there is a lot of talk about something strange...","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/rr2KTAekGtM","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"RedMort","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173440,"FileName":"224ffdb8-4ae1-4c0f-bf81-d0ad732a421f.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173440,"FileName":"a21cafe3-ddbc-440f-877e-e453dfeaeded.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":173440,"FileName":"b22443df-7359-4e92-8f15-a18fc40885cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173440,"FileName":"b537b3e8-5e1d-4576-9f70-63b84969d078.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173440,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Crush","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173419,"Name":"Pokemon Crystal Shards","ReleaseYear":"2009","Overview":"Description:\n\nPokemon Crystal Shards is a Pokemon Rom Hack that is based on Pokemon Emerald ROM.

Hack of the Year 2015, made by the man himself Spherical Ice? It's got everything: Tons of PokÃ©mon, amazing aesthetics, great gameplay, and a wonderful story. What's not to love? Well, I'll tell you what. There's one glaring flaw that Gaia has that makes the game virtually unplayable. What is that flaw?\n\nThe name.\n\nNow, this hack is going to fix the name \"Gaia\" and make it so that you can play the hack without burning your eyeballs out. To do this I've switched every instance of the letter \"G\" In-game with a much cooler letter, \"D\". I did this by going through all of the scripts I could find and changing each letter individually. If Spherical Ice had done it right in the first place and named the hack PokÃ©mon Daia, I would not have had to waste my Monday night fixing his game.\n\nNOTE: When I was switching letters the D key was next to the C key so sometimes I put the wrong one by accident but it's an intended feature so don't worry.\n\nNOTE: I couldn't actually figure out how to change the title screen since Spherical Ice cheated and moved stuff around in his ROM. Because of this I would recommend you close your eyes and click the A button for the first 30 seconds after you open up the ROM in your emulator.\n\nFeatures\n- Better Aesthetics\n- More Playable\n- Enhanced Gameplay\n- Revitalized Game Engine\n- 2.5x More Fun","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/40eU91J5-vA","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Dyskinesia","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173425,"FileName":"2b7b0701-dfcc-494c-976b-ae9653368537.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173425,"FileName":"e7578c72-a88b-41c5-a029-3538b62e2a2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173425,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Daia","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173428,"Name":"Pokemon Dardusk","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Introduction:\n\nPokemon Dardusk is about a post-apocalyptic PokÃ©mon world, where people and PokÃ©mon come back from the dead.

Some years after the Hoenn storyline. Have you ever wondered how a country would look like after hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and seaquakes?\n\nThis ROM hack brings you back to the first PokÃ©mon region, but with a new twist: Everything described above has already happened, because of the mess Maxie and Archie did in Hoenn. Yup, shit is bound to happen when you mess with the two continental PokÃ©mons to terraform the planet...\n\nFollow an all-new experience set in a never before seen Kanto. Experience the untold story of a young trainer who's beginning his first grand adventure. But...\nSomething's wrong.\n\nYou'll meet people whose purpose is not to steal PokÃ©mon or make money, nor do they use their PokÃ©mons to change the climate or anything else. They... Don't use their PokÃ©mons at all!\n\nMaybe their scheme is something beyond your comprehension. Maybe something has left them disappointed and has made them willing to fight... Who? Or what?\n\nWill those people get their revenge?\nVenture across this messed up Kanto, bigger but also more mysterious. Join the Protagonist along his journey, debunk conspiracies and become the very best, or... Die trying.\n\nTEAM (From PokemonHacking.it):\nIvanFGK, Andrea, Flygon, Lex@97, Gabriel, Stygian, Carl_J90\n\nOTHER COLLABORATORS:\nUnix, DragonType, MasterNinja98, PacoScarso, Zeppho, Zer0, Spinda94, eMMe97, fuji97\n\nCREDITS:\n874521, Kyle-Dove, Speedialga, Sagaxxy, Crito, WesleyFG, 0RCV0, CriSH698\n\nINFORMATION:\n\nWHY A BETA RELEASE AND WHAT IS ITS CURRENT STATUS?\n\nThis beta contains a minimum of five/six hours of gameplay (probably more), so we decided it was a good starting point to show the game to ROM hack enthusiasts and see how it's received among the audience.\n\nWith a bare minimum of five hours of gameplay, but probably more if you try to experience all the optional content the game offers, the beta it's currently a good indicator of how the game will play out in the future.\nWe have also used this release as a beta testing program, so that we could fix bugs and glitches people found on their playthoughs.\n\nWHAT THE GAME LOOKS LIKE AT THE MOMENT?\n\nWith the current release (1.5), we are proud to announce that the game is completely playable with barely any bug across the adventure.\n\nJust a sidenote for those who may have not noticed while reading: The game is NOT a remake, nor will it ever be one. Drab Conspiracy is a completely original adventure set in a Kanto built from the scratches, completely overhauled and with little similarities to the original region. We are not even using Fire Red, we're working on Ruby, so trust me when I tell you you won't find even a line of text from the original games.\n\nWHAT SETS OUR GAME APART FROM OTHER ROM HACKS?\n\nThe maps are so big they could almost be considered \"open world\", and they are filled with optional content players can choose to experience or bypass altogether.\n\nEverywhere in the game are hidden items, quests, and sometimes even branching paths in the story. Will you help the lab's assistant or act as a frightened child? I'm not going to tell you how to live your adventure, but be aware: certain actions could have consequences...\n\nThis doesn't mean our game is a sandbox experience, because it's not. It's a single player, story-driven game, and the plot takes a huge part on the adventure. But we wanted the adventure to be YOUR adventure, and so we've filled the game with content so that the player can choose how to live his own, personal experience.\n\nWHAT WILL THE FINISHED PRODUCT LOOK LIKE?\n\nWe are trying our best to deliver the best possible experience to our players. This means we are working hard on building complex maps filled with secret content and subquests, shaping awe-inspiring graphics and orchestrating original and fun events, involving good story and fun characters.\n\nThere will be a minimum of 15/20 hours of gameplay, but again, it could be more depending on how the player decides to live his adventure.\nWe are not trying to ship a game comparable to the \"sacred cows\" of the genre, but we'll try our best to deliver the best possible experience to our players: We won't probably be the very best, but we'll at least deliver a fun, emotional game that can let you spend some hours without regretting it!\n\nHOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THE FINISHED PRODUCT TO BE RELEASED?\n\nWe don't have a release date to share at the moment. This is not a job, this is a fanmade project we work on during our free time. We hope to release the second beta during 2019 holidays, but of course it's still just a placeholder date.\n\nOUR STORY:\n\nour journey has begun way back on September 2 2015, as a Joke between myself, the founder (IvanFGK), and my friend Stygian. From there onwards, the most skilled among the italian ROM hacking community have gathered and participated in the development of the game.\n\nAfter a long hiatus in 2017, the development resumed during summer 2018, when most of the game have been shaped and the first beta released.\nIt was a somewhat buggy release, and it would take six months for the game to be released in the current, definitive form (v1.5), with bugfixes and new content (two new maps, an old map completely redesigned, new events and gameplay balances).\n\nWe consider ourselves skilled in what we do, but we've never worked on a project of this caliber - a game with new graphics, settings and original story and characters. As the founder, I'm proud of the work of everyone who has worked with me and all the support they have given me during these years.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/GNauIaKa7Uo","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"EÂ²VaN","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2019-06-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"22c40d18-e610-4edd-95c5-f1657adf7eb9.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"cfd4d999-9a62-4318-a677-8eb2a3eb9583.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"4117d33a-df03-4aba-b1f1-42810173741d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"db19abc8-a484-4512-9484-26b8fdf39dbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"bb2a3ee2-68f4-4088-a110-a5e054f71b49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"2ed08934-02fc-4fbc-bc9e-3e4bd881f021.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"a2b91ac1-05ad-4d68-9be3-968d25d0caf1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"9f8f182c-a6b0-46bd-987e-89fcd4e5c84f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"83894b68-6bd7-4967-a00f-a261ef4da269.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"394eedc2-f862-4666-9a3c-d996e8be4932.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"de12be70-89ed-47d8-a316-583c17617721.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"33a7dc41-a031-472d-936d-fe2151e6f5b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"504bfc16-0d6e-49de-88af-8f63d4aab08e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173686,"FileName":"8b5782a4-8e06-46a4-b500-b3cb14a2751c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173686,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Drab Conspiracy","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":142463,"Name":"Pokemon Dragon Ball Z Team Training","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"About:\n\nDragon Ball Z Team Training is a PokÃ©mon Fire Red mod that makes your game all the Dragon Ball epicness you could ever want.

There are seven major division at present, with five of them published as manga in 26 volumes.he first story is based on the Red, Green, and Blue versions of the game. It is 3 volumes long as to reflect the 3 original versions of the game, with volume one being on a red pallette, 2 on green, and the 3rd on blue. It shows Red, the protagonist, and how he received Bulbasaur from Professor Oak and gets his Pokedex to start on his Pokemon journey, collecting Pokemon and battling gym leaders for the eight coveted gym badges. He later meets his rival Blue (who received Charmander) and is oddly enough, Oak's own grandson. Later in his journey, he encounters con artist Green, who sells him fake Pokemon items. She has stolen a Squirtle, the one stolen from Oakâs lab and evolved it into a powerful Wartortle. During the series Blue developes feelings for Green and hides it with his attitude.\n\nRed goes on to battling gyms after having been informed of them by the overweeny rival and he manages to receive the Boulder Badge, Cascade Badge, and the Rainbow badge from Brock, Misty and Erika respectively (who are plotting to defeat Team Rocket). He also teamed up with Misty (the Cerulean City gym leader) to foil the plans of Team Rocket on Mt. Moon and retrieved her brainwashed Gyarados, which later became his own. Other achievements include his capture of various Pocket Monsters, namely Pikachu in Pewter City, Snorlax when it blocked a route in a bike tournament, Eevee, who had been experimented on by Team Rocket, Aerodactyl from the Old Amber, Misty's Gyarados, and so on and so forth with less-used Pokemon. In addition, his Bulbasaur evolves into Venusaur and his Poliwhirl to Poliwrath.\n\nLater, Oak had been kidnapped by Team Rocket for creating a Mewtwo, and Red, Blue and Green arrive at Saffron City to take on the elite of Team Rocket. Redâs opponent is Electric-type trainer Lt. Surge, Blueâs opponent is Poison-type ninja trainer Koga, and Greenâs opponent is the Psychic gym leader of Saffron City, Sabrina, with each Rocket boss having one of the three legendary winged Pokemon, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. They managed to defeat Team Rocket and save Oak. Red's Ivysaur evolves into Venusaur in the process, and Green's Clefairy into Clefable utilising Red's Moon Stone. Red then travels to the Indigo Plateau to battle his rival Blue, having gained seven badges, but also prevails against the evil bio-weapon Mewtwo and Team Rocket's leader and legendary missing Viridian Gym Leader, Giovanni, on the way.\n\nRed later battles Blue in the PokÃ©mon League Championships and emerges victorious, claiming the title of champion of the Pokemon League. Blue is second place, and Green finishes third, after Professor Oak withdraws from the competition.\n\nThe next storyline is very loosely based on the Yellow version of the game, serving mainly as an original story to bridge the gap between the original adventure and the events in Johto. It is 4 volumes long.\n\nRed has disappeared after receiving a challenge letter sent to him by Lorelei of the Elite Four. They plan to lure him to them, so as to get information on Giovanniâs whereabouts. They also needed his Earth Badge. Only Redâs Pikachu, Pika, managed to escape, Red having been encased in ice. Yellow decided to go look for Red, as Red had helped her catch a Rattata before. Yellow asked Blue to train her in the skills of battling.\n\nLater, Lorelei catches up with Yellow and Bill, who found his way to Yellow. Lorelei traps them inside a cave using her Dewgongs's Ice Beam. Dewgong's Ice Beam merged with Cloyster's Spike Cannon to make deadly missiles. Yellow attached Pika's PokÃ©ball to her fishing rod and used a small opening to cast Pika outside to see this. Yellow used her Viridian Forest-given ability to see what Pika saw. Anticipating Lorelei's actions, Yellow does the same with an empty PokÃ©ball to have Lorelei destroy the decoy. A well-placed Ratatta breaks the ice with its teeth. Before she leaves, Yellow says her name was \"Amarillo del Bosque Verde\" (Spanish for Yellow of the Viridian Forest).\n\nYellow, Blaine, Blue, Green, Bill, Lt. Surge, Koga and Sabrina join forces to bring down the Elite Four together. They found out that Lanceâs master plan was to use the Gym Badges and create an amplifying effect at Cerise Island to power up a mysterious Legendary PokÃ©mon and destroy all humans in the world except themselves. They felt that humans and PokÃ©mon were not meant to coexist.\n\nRed turned up later at Cerise island to help Surge and Bill defeat Bruno. It is also revealed that Giovanni was the one who rescued Red from his ice coffin. The trainers send their power to Yellow, and with their combined strength she manages to defeat Lance.\n\nThe third adventure is based on the Gold, Silver, and Crystal versions of the game. It also includes the trainers from the First and Second chapters. It is 7 and a half volumes long, which is slightly longer than the first and second storylines combined.\n\nIt features the protagonists Gold, Silver and Crystal, and is centered mostly around the Johto region. In accordance with the games, Team Rocket tries to make a comeback, but instead of being defeated before Gold reaches the PokÃ©mon League (as it happens in the game), Team Rocket actually attacks the League. Also, the main goal in the story is not for Gold or Crystal to collect all the badges, but for Gold, it is to team up with a Cyndaquil and get Totodile back from Silver (who stole it), and for Crystal, it is to complete the PokÃ©dex.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/1qExTe8fxAc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Melash","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"f0e0a8e3-f3c2-4989-a782-b73e3c270397.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"2f87dd8d-f094-4704-9382-0e734101dfa9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"fd86c838-0f65-4ea7-aa8c-83cc1e093d5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"a052d79a-59cc-4f68-b498-7b6214299e0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"c500c094-de95-4ae1-b4b9-a14b416d68d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"8afa2c9a-3ad0-4dee-ab3a-59a95b88cb02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"1ff64291-4215-47fc-b6a3-1fa16ca1fc2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"9dbfa44a-fdc5-461b-8b55-251e05570bf1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"a12af97a-3223-46ca-80c8-f114dc21a191.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"466fff4a-72d1-4d1a-b947-346355e8369e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"0a07430d-4f33-4faf-89c7-1a70d61359a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"02e205f5-4558-48d5-add4-7b10e36c2924.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"973904c8-f8a6-4aa6-9999-3552f7682e91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"db597687-7108-419c-ac2b-b1848b4d8c5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"7ea5c810-1670-4f58-8400-e87de18a617c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"de5fdef5-f6e0-4bc9-9bd3-3bfee74657cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"ea784012-3e12-405a-87a9-612909f3b31b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"fa961710-e967-4bbf-86f6-baeefef08830.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"b3f3bfeb-12ac-4034-afc5-fd1249ed5f7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"f354978b-cedc-44f3-a510-3669c950b413.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"8c3fb2b0-d3e2-4e2f-abd0-6956300324ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"4fc4b6e2-12dd-4c8c-a079-211b1e3b8754.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173736,"FileName":"c439bf19-1658-4cd9-8df4-f6f19b72611d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173736,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Electric Yellow","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173737,"Name":"Pokemon Electro Ball","ReleaseYear":"2014","Overview":"Story:\n\nYou are a mere 12 year old child.

Because of these more dangerous conditions, Professor Greatbeard has allowed you to take one of his Pokemon for protection.\n\nThe unknowing hero makes the trip to Main Island, meeting researchers from the mainland that are currently studying the storm. Their attempts to glean the answer from some native Pokemon arenât working, unfortunately. Your journey leads you to Aquamaria Isle, where after a battle with Leader Fenton, you learn that the ancient elements are angered, and this is causing the disturbance.

Some favourites from FireRed Advanced make their return, like Fur Coat Furret, Fairy-type Pixilate Delcatty, and Grass/Fire Drought Sunflora, while others are new to the scene, like Strong Jaw Mightyena, Corrosion/Regenerator Garbodor, and Darmanitan with Zen Mode that doesn't suck.\n\nAnother thing this hack has in common with FireRed Advanced is that, while difficulty has generally been increased, my goal wasn't to make something soul-crushingly difficult, it was to make something enjoyable to play.\n\nUnlike FireRed Advanced, though, there are significant changes to Hoenn as a whole. Tons of NPCs have been edited, giving Hoenn a fresh feel. Many major characters have had their dialogue totally overhauled. One of the major unique features of the hack is that the Gym Leaders and Elite Four have completely switched positions. I won't spoil who's moved where (though you can check the documents if you want to know), but most gyms have been completely overhauled with new puzzles and challenges to fit their new leaders. There are a few new areas to see, too- the upper floor of every PokÃ©mon Centre, which formerly contained boring link stuff that nobody cares about and I don't feel like bothering with, has been converted into a convenient lounge where you can take a break, meet some amusing characters, and occasionally get some nifty stuff. Shell out money to an Egg Vendor in Rustboro or grab some brand-new healing items for your team at the Verdanturf CafÃ©, or check out the gift shop on the lower level of the Oceanic Museum.\n\nOf course, there are also plenty of other features. 85 total TMs are available (and they're of course reusable), and the battle engine has been updated to gen 7 standards, with all that implies. Fairy-types, physical/special split, moves and abilities and items from gens 4-7, all that good stuff.\n\nAlso every single PokÃ©dex entry is custom made and they're worth reading, I promise \n\nGeneral Advice:\n\nâ¢ Every available PokÃ©mon is viable. Yes, including Delcatty. Yes, including Corsola. Yes, including Luvdisc.\n\nâ¢ Visit the second level of PokÃ©mon Centres.\n\nâ¢ Talk to NPCs as often as possible.\n\nâ¢ A few beach routes, like Route 106, have dark sand where you can encounter wild PokÃ©mon if you don't want to surf or fish.\n\nâ¢ The in-game trades are extremely worth it, although only one is available in the current beta.\n\nâ¢ The move deleter and move relearner have swapped places, so you can get rid of HMs in Fallarbor.\n\nâ¢ Don't stress over stone evolutions, they continue to learn moves after evolving.\n\nâ¢ The \"Detailed Dex\" document has all the info you need regarding the PokÃ©mon available.\n\nâ¢ Altering Cave opens up after defeating the third gym, and the Desert Underpass opens up after beating the fifth and getting the fossil from Mirage Tower. Both are worth visiting.\n\nâ¢ Talk to gym leaders after battling them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/dgOX4Ku3FjU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Z-nogyroP","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"3cb27962-35bf-4012-ba6f-dfbdb9172a33.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"5869bbed-e96b-4b46-9ebf-0b5e7b3c4105.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"283e686f-2e48-4692-b2ae-64878f1d7d42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"ca750fef-46e6-4592-804e-617891c2ea50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"b1aa1e19-1045-4bd3-b6df-04cae4aef36c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"1457b3ba-0cc6-4ae7-8dae-6c5443994307.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"b462266e-6577-4d2a-ae8b-bf39e082305d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"af3744ea-89fd-49b6-ba5f-142d54b7181a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"3b55c8fc-74a4-4325-9959-7ae024f06391.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"854bf6f2-df52-4ee5-8dd3-bc8d50ad66ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"e04f96aa-1e3e-493a-8612-ccd0ab433553.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"d996a632-db35-40d5-924f-3662c324087e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173782,"FileName":"bee1d9d6-b584-466b-8f90-bc8de85b7670.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173782,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Emerald Advanced","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173784,"Name":"Pokemon Emerald Balanced","ReleaseYear":"2019","Overview":"Information:\n\nOnce again, I have created a Pokemon hack that aims to balance the game.

This should reset their location to behind you.\n\nPokÃ© Ball Changer: New!\nYou can now change the PokÃ© Ball your PokÃ©mon is currently held in by talking to the Ball Changer NPC.\nShe's located in the Lilycove Department Store on the 5th Floor.\nTo change Balls you need to pay 10.000 PokÃ©dollars and have at least one of the corresponding balls.\n\nAutoscaling Trainers & Wild Encounters: New!\nWild PokÃ©mon encounters and Trainers now scale to the number of badges you own!\nPlease note that they scale differently, with different ranges.\n\nElite 4 Rematch Parties: New!\nAfter beating the game for the first time, the game will default to the E4 rematch parties.\nCheck them out!\n\nIV Perfecting:\nYou can get an egg with perfect IV's and desired nature by utilizing the Genetic Code Mapping System.\n\nâ¢ You can consign up to 31 of a certain species to increase your Genetic Code Value(GCV).\nâ¢ You can use the GCV to generate an Egg of your saved species. The species you generate will have IV's equal to the GCV in each stat.\nâ¢ When you generate the pokemon, you will get to choose a nature.\nâ¢ The generated pokemon will be an Egg that you have to hatch.\n\nVisit the Space center to get started. It's the computer in the top left corner.\n\nFrontier Bank:\nThis lets you deposit money so that you don't lose as much when you lose.\nEventually, this will give you interest daily based on difficulty.\nVisit the NPC in the Battle Frontier pokemart to check out this new feature!\n\n5 Modes of play:\n\nâ¢ Hard mode is how my game was before the v2.5 update. It's vanilla experience gain.\nâ¢ Normal mode scales your EXP to the number of gyms you have beaten. It goes up by 12.5% per badge.\nâ¢ Easy mode is 4x base experience, for people who want to get through the game quickly, and aren't confident enough for harder modes.\nâ¢ Nuzlocke mode is an even harder variant of my game, with enforced nuzlocke rules.\nâ¢ Hardcore mode uses special rules. No pokecenters, Marts can be used but it's more expensive.\nâ¢ You gain less money and gain the default vanilla exp value. You deal less damage while receiving more damage.\n\n\nNuzlocke Mode:\n\nâ¢ Marts cannot be used.\nâ¢ Pokecenters can only be used three times.\nâ¢ Pokemon that faint will actually disappear from your party.\nâ¢ If you have an empty party, you fail the challenge. The game is switched to Normal mode.\nâ¢ Base experience is doubled, to offset the challenge of my game in nuzlocke mode.\nâ¢ You are given items and healed for free when you defeat a Gym leader. You only get the items once when you beat them for the first time.\nâ¢ The Waystone can only be used 3 times, but the charges get restored when you get a new badge.\nâ¢ The rules get lifted once you become the Champion\n\n\nRe-Fighting the Elite Four:\nWhen you fight them again, you will get teleported to an alternate Champion room after you've cleared the E4. While you're in here,\nyou walk to the middle, like how you walk to your throne in US/UM. At which point a random challenger will approach you and challenge\nyou for your title. There are currently 8 possible challengers, and more will be added over time until I reach 16. This is how the\ngame stays once you've met the requirements.\nNote that the tile that actually teleports you has a small delay before it takes effect. Just walk slowly for the last few squares of the final hall before the champion room.\n\n\n\nOther notable features:\n\nâ¢ Forecaster, an item that allows you to set any weather you want.\nâ¢ Completely custom jukebox. Use L in the start menu to activate, R to skip tracks sequentially. The currently playing track number is\n    displayed in the top left corner of the screen when the start menu is open.\nâ¢ Music on routes and in pokecenters is randomized on map load, so that you don't hear the same track for a long amount of time.\nâ¢ Remote access to the PC available when you complete a certain quest.\nâ¢ EXP Drive item that stores some exp earned in battle to be given to a specific mon later. Or toggle earning exp in battle.\nâ¢ Imprinter item, which replaces the broken functionality of EV Reduce berries. The consumable imprints you get reduce EVs to zero, rather than increments of 10.\nâ¢ Waystone item, which replaces the HM Fly functionality. The waystone gives you more locations you can teleport to, including each of the 7 Frontiers.\n\n\n\n\nThe new pokemon added to the game are as follows: (more in progress!)\nAlso complete with their proper cries!\n\nâ¢ Gallade\nâ¢ Roserade\nâ¢ Mismagius\nâ¢ Glaceon\nâ¢ Leafeon\nâ¢ Weavile\nâ¢ Froslass\nâ¢ Dusknoir\nâ¢ Rhyperior\nâ¢ Yanmega\nâ¢ Sylveon\nâ¢ Togekiss\nâ¢ Gliscor\nâ¢ Mamoswine\nâ¢ Electivire\nâ¢ Magnezone\nâ¢ Honchkrow\nâ¢ Porygon-Z\nâ¢ Crystal Onix\n\n\nNew Game +\nNew game + becomes available starting from the first time you visit the Hall Of Fame.\n\nâ¢ Only Pokemon in your PC Boxes are retained, including held items.\nâ¢ Unique key items are retained.(Imprinter, EXP Drive, Remote PC, Forecaster).\nâ¢ Dex progress is mostly retained, but only for the species that are in your boxes** at the time of New Game +.\nâ¢ When you start New Game+ you get to choose between Hard, Nuzlocke and Hardcore modes.\n\n\n(**Example: If you have a Kabutops that was a Kabuto, only the page for the Kabutops will remain.)\n\n\n\nQuest Lines:\n\nCurrently available and completed quest Lines: (** denotes relationship quest line)\n\nâ¢ Devon: Corporate\nâ¢ Devon: Scientist\nâ¢ Team Aqua: Shelly**\nâ¢ Team Aqua: Archie\nâ¢ Lana**\nâ¢ Dawn/Brendan** (Your rival, based on which gender you use)\nâ¢ Lanette**\n\n\nPlanned quests that haven't been started on yet:\n\nâ¢ Team Magma: Courtney**\nâ¢ Team Magma: Maxie\n\n\nCurrent Bugs:\n\nâ¢ Using some HM moves still shows your pokemon as if they were using the move sometimes. (Notably with Strength and Waterfall)\n\n\n\nAbout Emulation Compatibility:\nMy game is a custom compiled version of emerald with major core code changes. My game will only work properly on emulators that are\naccurate to real GBA hardware, or the actual hardware with supported flashcarts.\n\nThe only emulator I can confirm has 100% compatibility is mGBA.(Including the mGBA core for RetroArch)\n\nHardware Compatibility:\n\nâ¢ Real GBA, GBA SP (Flashcart. Must have support for SRAM, flash 1mbit save file, RTC)\nâ¢ Real NDS/DS Lite (Flashcart. See above)\nâ¢ 3DS (Virtual Console, mGBA port, special flash carts)\nâ¢ Nintendo Switch port of the mGBA emulator. You need cfw on your switch to use this.\nâ¢ Presumably, if you can figure out how to inject it, Nintendo Switch Virtual Console as well.\n\nOther emulators can work, but with limited compatibility. The most common issue is black screen freezes when transitioning to and from battle, and between maps.\n\nThese are not issues I can fix. Emulation accuracy is key here, and mGBA is the most accurate emulator available.\n\n\nBeta Menu to help with save compatibility\nHow to use the Beta Menu:\n\nâ¢ Open Start Menu\nâ¢ Turn off Jukebox if you have it on by holding L and pressing R\nâ¢ Highlight 'Close'\nâ¢ Hold R and press A","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/eLFrptFwje4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Ryuhouji","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171873,"FileName":"16752ee7-b5d2-4f77-8111-b88f00a497d2.png","Type":"Box -

The successful crime syndicate Team Rocket has partnered with a new company called the Trade Bureau, an organization that makes profit through buying and selling Pokemon. Together, they send operatives to catch and steal wild Pokemon by the hundreds to the HOENN Region. Meanwhile, agents in HOENN return the favor by shipping exotic HOENN Pokemon back. Because of this mess, all the KANTO Region Pokemon have decided to migrate to HOENN, while all the HOENN Pokemon did the vice versa. This event was marked as the HOENN Migration, which, in the game, happened not long ago. You, the hero, are a new trainer starting in this HOENN infested region. Grabbing the last KANTO Pokemon, you must fight your way through the region, and help the cause to destroy the corrupt Trade Bureau from causing more regional trouble. Utilizing the wild HOENN Pokemon, you will battle trainers who still have Kanto Pokemon, and ultimately, be forced to face the unstoppable heads of both Team Rocket and the Trade Bureau. The game is a true region vs. region fight, and the outcome as to which one wins is up to you. \n\nFeatures\n\nPokemon Emerald Green isnât the best rom hack out there, but it puts some quite challenging twists on the gameplay. It is recommended you Nuzlocke the game.\n\nNow, here are the core aspects of the game:\n\nâ¢ All KANTO Pokemon in the wild have been replaced with their HOENN counterparts. However, the trainers keep their KANTO Pokemon for the most part. This gives the region vs. region flare\n\nâ¢ National Pokedex is given to you at the start of the game.\n\nâ¢ Edited Storyline and Dialogue to help you immerse yourself into the game.\n\nâ¢ Boss Battles, such as Rival, Gym Leaders, and Giovanni, have much stronger teams with unique movesets. Some have both KANTO and HOENN Pokemon!\n\nâ¢ Safari Zone is better, it includes a wide variety of Pokemon.\n\nBugs:\n\n-Some dialogue boxes are slightly messed up. Doesnât affect gameplay.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/JZmhuUBH8n8","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sulfurous","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173791,"FileName":"1c326c22-24ca-431b-8ad3-8947730e9dd9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173791,"FileName":"75ede0cd-2c98-4a82-ad66-344ca34cc0f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173791,"FileName":"e535f7ce-3331-43c6-9e68-abdef65cf107.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173791,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Emerald Green","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173792,"Name":"Pokemon Emerald Hard Edition","ReleaseYear":"2016","Overview":"Introduction: \n\nWelcome to PokÃ©mon Emerald: Hard Edition, this is what I call a 'enhancement' of PokÃ©mon Emerald, which is basically PokÃ©mon Emerald, same story-line, same trainers, same gym leaders etc. but with a few added features, this is not to impress anyone but to simply make this game a little more challenging and fun, I personally made this for myself just as a challenge for me but I thought why not share it and see how others enjoy it. I am aware there are others like this, i.e PokÃ©mon Emerald 386, but this game focuses on the difficulty concept rather than All 386 PokÃ©mon being catch-able, hence the name.\nBare in mind that this game is still at early stages so it has very few features but if it's gets positive feedback then I will proceed to add more features and make this enhancement better, this is really just a test, you may think that this is simple and that it only takes a couple of hours to edit the features I have created in this but editing EVERY trainers, Gym Leaders, Rivals, Grunts, Elite Fours PokÃ©mon takes A LOT of time, effort, coordination and patience as you have to get it correct and set the reasonable levels for that certain area, I found myself working on this for 3, nearly 4 days which included A LOT of planning and preporation and I think I've put quite a lot of hard work into this so I hope you enjoy this as I have tried to make it as hard, but fun as possible!\n\nFeatures:\n\nâ¢ Increased Difficulty\n\nâ¢ Gym Leaders all have teams of six with ALOT higher levels!\n\nâ¢ Trainers difficulty and level increased, including ALL trainers in Hoenn, ALL Magma/Aqua Grunts, Admins & Leaders and your Rivals team is much more complex, that's right, no more having to put up with Mamga & Aqua grunts using the same PokÃ©mon over & over!\n\nâ¢ Rematch trainers edited to a very high level. This means EVERY trainer & Gym Leader registared into the PokÃ©nav, when you rebattle them, their teams will be ALOT stonger, and tougher!\n\nâ¢ Elite Four Team tweaked, every member has 6 PokÃ©mon plus higher levels.\n\nâ¢ EVERY trainer has been edited, some with there original team, some with different PokÃ©mon and harder PokÃ©mon, this also includes Team Magma & Aqua grunts, Admins, Leaders and your rival.\n\nâ¢ 386 PokÃ©mon obtainable in the grass areas, caves, water, all around Hoenn!\n\nâ¢ Evolutions changed, i.e Kadabra would normally evolve to Alakazam via trade but now Kadabra evovles to Alakazam at level 40.

Every PokÃ©mon has managed to achieve perfection. Because of this, the winner of PokÃ©mon battle depends solely on strategy and team building. The team building metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches.\n\nâ¢Every single PokÃ©mon is level 100 (no need for grinding. YAY!)\nâ¢Revives CANNOT be used in battle.\nâ¢EVs are nonexistent (Badge boosts are still in the game).\nâ¢In the wild, you will find PokÃ©mon at the latter evolutions than in the original game.\nâ¢Since the game is centered around catching A LOT of PokÃ©mon, Master Balls are purchasable for 10 Poke bucks in every mart.\nâ¢Fully evolved wild Pokemon have weaker/ more situational movesets than their pre-evolved forms.\n(The movesets are still true to what the Pokemon can have in the main games (mostly). These are moves either gained by level, TMs, breeding or events)\nDepending on what you need, you can use the pre-evolved form or the evolved one. Movesets are heavily dependent on the stats of the Pokemon (either in a good or a bad way).\nâ¢Your (already fully evolved) starter, however, has a solid moveset from the begining (not the best one, tho).\nâ¢Standard evolution is gone. Now, you evolve every PokÃ©mon with a Moon Stone (except the elemental eeveelotions). This means that you can transfer a better pre-evolved moveset to a evolved Pokemon. But there are only 3 Moon Stones in the game (in Vermilion, Rocket Hideout and Two Island). You should use them on the Pokemon, that you will truly require for a long time, or else you can get yourself in a lot of trouble.\nâ¢Aditionally, all TMs are obtainable only once. Use those wisely as well.\nâ¢HMs have been nerfed, because of their infinite usage.\nâ¢Since Surf is now weak, Water types get a new strong water move. The TM for Water Pulse has been changed to Muddy Water, which functions almost exactly like Surf in the original games.\nâ¢Move relearner now gives you 1 situationaly good move on a Pokemon in exchange for a Big Mushroom (Big Mushrooms can be bought in Celadon for 20000 Poke bucks). These moves can vary between different evolved forms, so you might miss out on something if you evolve early\nâ¢You no longer have to fight Brock as the first Gym Leader (believe me, you don't want to try to beat Brock first). The map is opened to you until the Rock Tunnel entrance (you can access Route 9 and 10 without CUT). This means that Misty is the first required Gym Leader.\nâ¢Gym Leaders are EXTREMELY tough. You will need form specific teams, that are capable of fighting them.\nâ¢The three Sevii Islands now contain PokÃ©mon from other regions.\nâ¢Some in-game trades have been changed.\n\nThe point of this hack is to (sort of) replicate the experience of playing a zero EXP run of PokÃ©mon.\nThe hack is still the basic Fire Red, but modified, so there is no need to grind (that's because it's impossible) and Pokemon are extremely easy to catch. With this, you can easily build many different teams very quickly, which can be used to stand a chance against very tough Gym Leaders.\nIt is recommended to just throw balls at any Pokemon species that you haven't caught already (including different evolution stages).\nYou may need to have a bit different mindset when playing this hack, compared to a regular Pokemon game. It is no longer around building a single team, but about strategizing on how to beat opponents, that are stronger than you. Pokemon you have a expendable, since there is no exp and that means, that you can SELF-DESTRUCT or DESTINY BOND as much as you want.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/nSONiK5cb-c","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Manekimoney","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":172066,"FileName":"17175484-eae6-4b5e-b780-a23287681cc2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172066,"FileName":"3940ff50-355b-425c-b434-d4fa85fb7890.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172066,"FileName":"5adc78bb-87ed-4b1c-b2b4-c09484aa652a.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172066,"FileName":"a3f8f4a6-980d-4fc7-bddf-d41b7ce57488.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172066,"FileName":"c870c004-fd39-4bb1-a355-393186176b27.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":172066,"AlternateName":"Pokemon FireRed 20XX","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172066,"AlternateName":"Pokemon 20XX","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172066,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Fire Red 20XX","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":197826,"Name":"Pokemon Fire Red Omega","ReleaseYear":"2009","Overview":"Pokemon Fire Red Omega is a hack of Pokemon Fire Red with numerous significant changes to make the game an intriguing and sophisticated experience for knowledgeable players. The first and most obvious change is the sheer volume of available Pokemon-- over 30 are available just in the opening routes/Viridian forest, and all 389 are incorporated into the game. Furthermore, evolution stones are easily accessed earlier and trade-evolution Pokemon instead evolve by level up, making everything fair game. Wild Pokemon (and trainers) all tend to be at higher levels too, and your Pokemon grow quickly as a result.\n\nBut, you're going to need all the extra strength you can get-- because the battles are real challenges. All the gym leaders have 6 Pokemon, and they are TOUGH. You can't just catch a grass and expect to beat Brock when Rhyhorn uses Flamethrower and OHKO's your Shroomish. You can't expect Nidoking or Diglett to win you the match against Surge when Raichu outspeeds and OHKOes you with Surf.\n\nBecause of the sheer challenge of bosses, not all Pokemon can be useful throughout the entire game-- you can't just keep grinding an early game Pokemon and expect to come out on top. Also with the high availability of high level and powerful teammates, switching the team up partway through becomes a real considerable strategy. You can't just think to rely on old R/B favorites like Nidoqueen and Snorlax and expect to walk through the game!\n\nIt's a frontier where we Poke nerds can really be put to the test!","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197826,"FileName":"f3942aed-93a6-4051-b777-081cb0f6ec68.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":197826,"AlternateName":"Pokemon FireRed Omega","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":173884,"Name":"Pokemon FireRed Backwards Edition","ReleaseYear":"2012","Overview":"About:\n\nHave you ever thought \"You know, man... if you like, went south of Pallet at the beginning of the game, you would TOTALLY be able to go through Kanto backwards\"?

I once saw a similar ROM where you could catch gens 1-3, but most of them were only on the islands.\n\n\nSo here it is. All Kanto, Johto and Hoenn Pokemon can be obtained in the wild. One species of EVERY evolution line can be obtained before you fight the Elite 4 (Legends an exception). A definitive Nuzlocke experience! Several additional features were added for fun. Now includes Gen 3 Special split!\n\n\nFeatures\n\n- One of every evolution line can be found in the wild\n- Evolutions fixed. Trade and Hold Item Evolutions now use either levels or Sun/Moon Stones.\n- New items added to Celadon. Training items, Evolution Stones, and cheap vitamins!\n- Move Relearner now lives with the Deleter in Fuschia.\n- Wild Legendaries! Special Legend Hunters will tell you where they hide.\n- [7/10/2015] Now includes a different version that has the Physical/Special split. Take your pick!\n\nAnd more! The rest will be detailed in the included text files.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"RemixV4","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2015-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":165406,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon FireRed Remixed","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":3490,"Name":"PokÃ©mon FireRed Version","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"PokÃ©mon FireRed and LeafGreen take place mostly in the fictional region of Kanto.

Ontak is often a forgotten region and has few memorable moments. But not all is well, the mountainous lands have succumb to terrors that were previously thought unimaginable. Ontak on the exterior may seem peaceful, but there is an underground war that is being fought in Ontak. The only thing that keeps the population of Ontak in complete denial of their detriment is that nothing is out of the ordinary on the surface. But in the Underworlds there are sinister plots at hand. On one stormy night a young trainer was born in the Southern Plateau and since that night there has never been rain on the Western Side of the Ontak region. Some believe that this is nothing more than circumstance but some have faith that this is a trainer with capabilities that have previously been unimaginable. The only thing that is certain is that this trainer has a clear goal in life. That goal is to be the very best like no-one ever was.\n\n1) This game has removed the need for all HM's with the exception of Surf and Strength. Some of the other HM's are available but there is no requirement to use them.\n\n2) Players are able travel quickly between towns that they have already visited using the \"World Map Warp\". To remove people who block the way players must do one of the following; beat the gym in that town, complete an event in that town or simply talk to the individual blocking the path.

Some may like it, some won't, that's only up to you.\n-Your adventure is far from over after the Pokemon League!\n-The story has been noticably changed(isn't that obvious anyway?)!\n-Difficulty has been increased as I think that the original FireRed(and by the way most of the Pokemon games are way too easy)lacks difficulty!\n-Meet familar faces from other Pokemon games who'll be either friend or foe(rather foe, better than if it was the opposite, right?)!\n\nVery important: Read this before you play!\n-Make sure to get the National Pokedex or most of your Pokemon won't evolve! You get the National Pokedex pretty early in the beginning.\n-Some road blocks will ony vanish if you got the right badge! For example the policeman at Route 107 will only disappear if you got 2 badges(Sometimes you need to leave and come back.\n-Talk to everyone. Seriously, even if you don't like to hear(read) what Youngster Joey has to say about his Rattata, listen to the people. I hope you won't regret this.\n-Open your eyes.Pokemon is about discovering on your own. When you've spent at least a month and you still can't progress then feel free to post your problem here.\n\nAfter the main story: If you want to continue you need to have captured at least 60 Pokemon! and then talk to you-will-know-who.

Something different and unique. And looking ofr information about PokÃ©mon, I found some communities and blogs (Pokecommunity, WaH, and so on).\n\nI use a remake of PokÃ©mon Gold (now more simmilar to Crystal mixed with Fired Red) because I believe PKMN SG was an awesome and a potential game. So I start to make improvements and learning about the rom hacking. Tools for create your own version for this game makes a new complete world to me, so I tried to make a revolution.\n\nÂ¿What if I make an improve of a remake?\n\nIn order to do that, I choose SG due to his simplicity, atractiveness, and gameplay. I made improvements in sound effects, graphics, PokÃ©mon's, trainers, history, and an unbelievable new historyline!\n\nI truly hope that you can enjoy this game and made me a critical analysis, a review, feedback, or just a comment in this section below. I would totally appreciate that! \n\nSo... anyway, thanks to all \"pokeforums\" and \"pokeromhackers\" that make me do this.

Once busy roads are cracked and overgrown with weeds, and cities - bustling once upon a time - lay in moldering ruins, home only to scavenging beasts and forgotten history. The residents of your little village whisper about a story - passed down to them through untold generations - detailing a series of devastating, terrible Flashes that had destroyed what was once, it is said, was Eden. The Flashes came from nowhere, the villagers say, and vaporized everything in their paths, leaving terrible sickness in their wake. Nothing that lived anywhere near the Flashes survived - including a mysterious race of creatures who were said to possess great magic.\n\nThis is the world you and your sister were born into - small, helpless, and innocent; and warned from your youngest days to never take a step from the secluded forest village where your small band of survivors huddled. You listened - after all, you were a timid child, and not willing to tempt fate - but something ached within you, all the same. Was the Earth ever really an Eden? What of the magic-wielding creatures - did they still exist? Had they ever existed? The answers the villagers gave to these questions contradicted each other - what was the truth? And was there such thing as a better life?\n\nAfter a horrible tragedy, you fall into a deep sleep and have a mysterious dream - a great Lord, who dwarfs you in size and in majesty, appears before you and gives you dire news...and a miraculous gift. A terrible evil that could destroy all that remains of the world is lurking in the far frozen North - and although you are young, and although you are small, the Lord trusts in your great strength of soul to vanquish the evil - and perhaps pave the way for Eden to begin anew.\n\nThe power of \"Super Rising Thunder,\" and the inner strength of a timid young soul - is it enough to save your crumbling world? But as brave as you are deep inside, there is one catch...\n\nYou're a Pichu.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHFRZNOJdkg","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Perri Lightfoot","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172039,"FileName":"fd2fccd6-2906-4ad9-8f8f-b1ebefd25615.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172039,"FileName":"dd4a3f7d-8de9-4096-98c1-f1c8730bebe6.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172039,"FileName":"9bcceeee-42e3-44da-8957-0235a14ff02c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172039,"FileName":"31fe3fc4-c52d-4d8d-bacb-93ae3bee9a7f.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":172039,"AlternateName":"PokÃ©mon Super Rising Thunder","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172039,"AlternateName":"Pokemon SRT","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":128840,"Name":"Pokemon Sweet","ReleaseYear":"2014","Overview":"PokÃ©mon Sweet is a hack of PokÃ©mon FireRed.\n\nWhat do you think and what do you see when seeing the word Sweet?

This is completely different from the regular Emerald game you are used to. However, it is different, in a very fun and cool way :)\n\nFeatures:\n\n    650 PokÃ©mon: This may not be the first Emerald sideshow game to have more PokÃ©mon than just 386, but, as of May 2015, this is the Emerald sideshow game with the most PokÃ©mon to catch. Not only that, but every single one of them is catchable, either through an event, or in the wild. Not only that, but the Trainers, Gym Leaders, Evil Teams, Elite Four, and Champion have new PokÃ©mon as well.\n    100+ new moves: In order to compensate with the new PokÃ©mon, there has been quite a few new moves added to game to add to everyone's movesets. Some with new animations, and some with new effects.\n    Physical/Special Split: To make the game more current, a proper Physical/Special Split has been implemented to the game, including icons to denote each move.\n    \"Have Specific PokÃ©mon\" Events: In order to encounter certain PokÃ©mon, or more specifically, legendary PokÃ©mon, you must have one to three PokÃ©mon in your party in order for the event to work.\n    Fairy-type: Yes, the Fairy-type that has been shown in PokÃ©mon X & Y, has been added to the game.\n    Updated Stats: Also, PokÃ©mon that got their stats updated in X & Y now have them updated in this game.\n    New Evolution Methods: PokÃ©mon that evolved through trade have a different means of evolving. Not only that, but because of the new PokÃ©mon, completely new evolution methods have been added, like Map Name Evolution, Move Evolution, etc. That, and three new evolution items have been added. The Dawn Stone and Dusk Stone from Diamond and Pearl, and the Link Cable from PokÃ©mon Mystery Dungeon.\n    Running Shoes Update: Like the newer generation games, you can use the running shoes to run inside of buildings.\n    Reusable TMs: Introduced in PokÃ©mon Black & White, TMs can be used as many times as you like.\n    Egg Hatching Level: The levels of eggs that hatch are now at Level 1, just like in the newer games.\n    Catch EXP: A mechanic introduced in X & Y, now when you capture a PokÃ©mon, your PokÃ©mon will gain EXP.\n    De-capitalization: NO MORE OF THIS.

The Main Items Pocket has been extended to hold 200+ Items!\n-100+ REUSABLE TMs: How else can I describe it haha!\n-Proper Mega Evolution/Primal Reversion: I hated the way Mega Evolutions were in the dumb alpha, so it works as intended now!\n-Battle Frontier Updated: I did this for the fun of it. The Battle Frontier has no limits to which PokÃ©mon you bring (You can use your Mega Rayquaza holding a Life Orb). But the Trainers there are allowed to use them as well ;)\n-Running Indoors: Way more convenient, in my opinion.\n-New Repel System: Instead of hunting through your bag for a Repel, the game will ask you if you want to use another one!\n-Gain EXP from capturing a PokÃ©mon: Now with no more PokÃ©dex glitch!\n-Deletable HMs: THANK GOD!\n-Level 1 Eggs: No other way to describe this!\n-New Battle Backgrounds: It makes it look a little more updated!\n-Harder Difficulty (as of 2-5-2017): I've received complaints of the game being too easy, so the game has been adjusted accordingly.\n-Level 250 (as of 2-5-2017): 7.8/10 too much level\n\nKnown Glitches:\n-When you beat the game, on the hall of fame screen, some new PokÃ©mon will show up as one of the original 386. It might have to do with some limiter somewhere.\n-When leveling up, some new PokÃ©mon will have a different colored icon if they leveled up while not in battle. As I said, a limiter needs to be fixed somewhere.\n-When selecting multiple PokÃ©mon in a box, some new PokÃ©mon will have a different colored icon.

The philosophy of the design focused on distributing encounters to the player based on the viability of a Pokemon. Each and every Pokemon within Generation 3's National Dex was discussed and debated with my Twitch chat upon whether or not they were to be included.\n\nThe only changes made were to wild Pokemon and static encounters as well as adding NPCs that restrict access to certain areas. The reasoning behind this is to get as close to beating Pokemon Emerald with only bad Pokemon as possible.\n\nThe game is optimized for the Nuzlocke challenge and that is in my opinion the most fun way to play it. That being said feel free to enjoy the game in whatever way you like.

In the future, Earth has become home to many different alien races. While most of them are peaceful, some are not. In order to protect earth, six teens were called to form the Space Patrol Delta team. Players will control a certain ranger for each of the nine levels. While the rangers' fighting abilities are similar, each has his or her own unique power. The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There's also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters. Fans of the POWER RANGERS won't want to miss this instalment in the series.

Aided by the powers of the Sands, the Prince has the ability to perform a range of time-manipulating maneouvres, such as the Power of Revival (rewind up to two seconds); the Power of Delay (slow-motion); The Power of Restraint (freeze enemies in time); and The Power of Gathering (rebuild specific objects). Making use of these powers is key to progression through the game, and both your life gauge and a number of the game's puzzles rely on them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Platform","Developer":"Ubisoft","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2006-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":172833,"FileName":"c119e171-f7b9-4e95-bd23-3a136ede21aa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172833,"FileName":"458a9fb2-3a4f-4b8f-b20e-1a381dd39ad9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172833,"FileName":"61aefae6-39ff-4a74-9ac1-697527d18a5f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172833,"FileName":"bd6448f8-82c5-4d64-93b9-24e4816df8f4.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":172833,"FileName":"34aeb91a-5d15-487a-90e0-f1f3bec338e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176693,"Name":"Princess Blue: Hime Kishi Monogatari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fortress city Silt is the capital city of the Lucitamia kingdom.

There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally, our heroes Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine make their way toward the distant dark castle, challenging - and being challenged by - everyone you come across in a game of Puyo Pop.\n\nPuyo Pop Fever is a puzzle game of the falling-block variety, the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by combining four or more of the same color, which will then vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen.

These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.\n\nIt also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Irem","Publisher":"DSI Games","ReleaseDate":"2004-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"01d6f596-52c3-4125-aacc-1a45ccdb6b4f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"fb18d41c-ae9e-40aa-9bb3-05423fbe0341.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"0a48f19e-e263-413d-a372-e64eb5c1042c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"46ea6aa7-ee9c-4011-8246-4e44be5ce329.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"1e2fa8eb-57fd-4d07-8054-1b3fe2215780.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"ffa40b1b-d4fe-4e61-8f4e-7d8e13977f78.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"d4eb9289-4528-42d2-837b-04c597986958.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"a68510d0-1f6f-4834-96d4-d5bb054b6f64.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"4445ec44-28b9-4698-b76a-22b8345aa88d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"806c934a-2b19-4b89-b779-5408524047fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"77c37701-8e94-43ee-9760-e73e73d884b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"686e0d20-3c1c-4800-91c1-4b444c7b8dca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2345,"FileName":"805bf166-8dab-4418-af08-226816f28331.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28201,"Name":"Rugrats: Castle Capers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An all-new, side-scrolling platform style game featuring six huge levels based on classic fairytales with a Rugrats twist.

With the defeat of the latter, Sam Stone, again victorious, finally returns to his time.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"The Climax Group","Publisher":"Global Star Software","ReleaseDate":"2004-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"dd030a50-ab75-4ec2-ab31-03c94d896117.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"72e94b4a-fe2d-4a7b-ba46-e52e792907d6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"e7b8d5a2-3bb6-41c8-9ccc-60cbe73fedc0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"11d50873-f7f9-442d-8020-469586f5f6f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"2c17642c-c21e-403e-8a9a-c1a690499ca1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"4ec04d4f-b3dd-438a-a39d-9402bd794d5a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"52cfe69a-b441-4f37-b2cb-10b1e144cacc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"0c756bdf-79b9-4799-8604-bf6f1ca03c82.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"298795b8-deee-4018-8e38-37c85f0f256a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"4dec6dc7-6a07-442e-8e12-170e2ff418fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"9e58dd84-e12a-4fbc-94e7-e915758967e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"8c7228d7-b6e7-4c2e-9c04-fc544669d4e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3501,"FileName":"5de7350e-95b9-4574-b0f1-fe68fe672e04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":3501,"AlternateName":"Serious Sam Advance","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":178704,"Name":"Shaman King Card Game: Chou Senjiryakketsu 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shaman King: Chou Senjiryakketsu 2 is an Action Adventure game, developed by Studio Saizensen and published by King Records, which was released in Japan in 2002.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Studio Saizensen","Publisher":"King Records","ReleaseDate":"2002-07-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178704,"FileName":"914207f9-c1f9-4cd6-aeac-7b295abf1103.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":178704,"FileName":"b5ae7566-1c53-40b4-a684-ae749676aca7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":178708,"Name":"Shaman King Card Game: Chou Senjiryakketsu 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shaman King: Chou Senjiryakketsu 3 is a Role-Playing game, developed by Studio Saizensen and published by King Records, which was released in Japan in 2002.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Studio Saizensen","Publisher":"King Records","ReleaseDate":"2002-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178708,"FileName":"af963d6c-51e4-4c39-bd58-096c6d08e41c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":178708,"FileName":"02f4a0c3-b9c0-4a94-ae28-68d656dcbfc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":178708,"AlternateName":"Shaman King: Chou Senjiryakketsu 3","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":28206,"Name":"Shamu's Deep Sea Adventures","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"All is not well within Shamu's beloved SeaWorld Adventure Park - Poseidon wants to steal the magic of the park away from Shamu and SeaWorld.

In more than 24 levels displayed in isometric view, the player controls a sheep dog and must herd sheep, moving them into a truck within a time limit. This is mainly done by approaching the sheep, which makes them move into the opposite direction. This way they must be guided around obstacles and away from dangers. The dog can also grab a sheep to carry it, bark to encourage movement further and leave treats behind for the sheep to follow him.\n\nPlayers can select from two different dogs at the start of the game who differ in attributes like speed and strength. Further dogs can be unlocked by playing through the game's various modes. The main mode is called Normal Mode and presents the levels grouped into four different stages. Within a stage, the levels can be tackled in any order, but only once all levels are done the next stage opens up. Before a level, the type of sheep to be herded can be selected. Some types are more difficult to control, resulting in a higher score multiplier.\n\nThe game's second mode is called Arrange Mode. It features the same stages and levels, but introduces a new element: the leveling up of sheep and dog. The dog levels up by reaching a certain score, which increases his abilities. The sheep also level up, mainly be performing certain feats within a level.

Players must get through specific platform challenges by utilizing each character's strengths and abilities. Shrek is beefy, so he can carry items that can be stacked elsewhere, or butt-stomp weakened floors. Donkey can leap higher and kick down walls.

Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game employs a 3D isometric view- not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D though, and while you think it wouldn't work- it does :P\n\nYou can have 9 characters to choose from, 5 modes of play; Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games; you can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, each character has a bunch of moves you can use to beat the you-know-what out of whoever you're fighting. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks, and depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard), you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.\n\nAmong the other many features, Sonic Team has also made the game more dynamic with the addition of a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to.

As you likely know, the idea behind Sorry! is to move four pawns around a game board from start to home. Players take turns picking up cards to see how far they will be able to move one pawn. The cards can show a number between one and twelve, or the word \"sorry\". Drawing a one or two will let you remove one of your pawns from start, and a \"sorry\" card will let you move one of your pawns from start to any space occupied by an opponent's pawn, knocking them back to their starting space. Some cards have special effects; for instance, an eleven will let you trade places with someone else, while a four will make you move backward!\n\nThe second game is Aggravation. While Sorry! only allows up to four players, Aggravation allows up to six. Like Sorry!, Aggravation challenges you to be the first player to move from start to home. A dice is used to determine how far you can move in this game. You must roll a one or a six to exit the starting area, and rolling a six at any time will let you immediately roll again. Once again, landing on a space that's already occupied will send the original occupant back to their starting space. Once again, there are \"shortcuts\" than can be used to your advantage. If you roll the right number, you can move to a special space in the middle. You must roll a one to leave the space, but when you do, you can move very close to your home area! If you land on the other spaces nearest this center space, you can jump around these spaces to get around the board quickly.\n\nScrabble Junior features two modes: an \"easy game\", and an \"advanced game\". The easy game is completely different from traditional Scrabble. At the start of the game, each player is given seven tiles, each with a letter on it. For every tile a player uses, they receive a replacement, until there are no more tiles left to hand out. A game board is displayed with a number of words displayed in a crossword puzzle-like fashion. Your goal is to place letter tiles on the board that match the letters shown. The catch is that you can only place tiles in the first available space nearest the beginning of a word. You score by placing the tile that finishes a word, and the player who finishes the most words throughout the game is the winner. If it's possible for you to place a tile somewhere, you HAVE to place one, so you canât just refuse to build on a word so that someone else can't finish it. You are able to see other players' tiles, so you can try to delay their finishing a word if you have multiple options for which tile to put where.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXwKs4BvgbQ","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Gravity-I","Publisher":"Destination Software Inc (DSI)","ReleaseDate":"2005-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"dec4b2de-3d8d-45aa-b492-5b50039fffd9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"3ddc735a-a264-4b85-a54d-1c3a4f77dec8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"582b4752-a61f-4f96-9531-a3ecf4aaac15.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"a73756ea-04ec-4de9-89fa-c85aa95e04a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"87e66314-1a1f-46cf-9cfb-859c32eed6c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"1e9032d9-f1d7-4e41-bebe-ce9cf09b60d2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"50c5f977-7780-4a4f-97ed-0b6dabc5b408.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"1ed777ec-4858-4e63-b49c-a0d86ff63d0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"2fc20c8a-7411-4930-8a24-9f7d2f007a69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"ac6b29c3-de8c-4549-a2f0-83ac8fe8402d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141944,"FileName":"b4105094-00db-41f4-8148-f8d591ec0f67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":141944,"AlternateName":"Sorry Aggravation Scrabble Junior","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141944,"AlternateName":"3 in 1: Sorry! + Aggravation + Scrabble Junior","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141944,"AlternateName":"Three-in-One Pack: Sorry! + Aggravation + Scrabble Junior","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":3696,"Name":"Space Channel 5: Ulala's Cosmic Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"When the Morolians invade, ace reporter Ulala scoops the story for Space Channel 5.

As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.\n\nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.\n\nThe sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.\n\nYou get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.\n\nA variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Crawfish Interactive Ltd.","Publisher":"Wanadoo Edition","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"7de9dc01-1f38-42fc-9839-40a2323239df.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"1d7e0fde-c6aa-49c3-885a-1add769ea99c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"c17fb68b-3aa6-4452-ba29-32050d0b4dd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"9a15e94f-994d-4975-a3ac-235c3da3966a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"f1072ef8-8fe1-4f97-b576-aad7a55c5f57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"17d8a83b-e7e2-498d-8ffc-a8e2c9bf2010.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"a64a9d9b-5138-48dc-9343-04018d7f0520.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"8f642dda-d584-439b-b3a6-4a05501de396.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"08c48b58-1822-45a8-bfd0-bb72b19c80db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"6ed8642f-98e3-4d2a-8ae3-e8f1ab86c54e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26178,"FileName":"db7f6e8b-eef5-4f43-98ae-2daddf338462.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":26178,"AlternateName":"Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":3698,"Name":"Spider-Man","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture.

In every level, the goal is to collect one particular ingredient for fulfilling the latest errand. Swimming or lying in SpongeBob's way are various hostile sea creatures he can dispatch with a slap from his giant red glove. In addition, he can pick up several items that allow more options, like several different weapons, including a fishing net, a coral blower and a jelly gun - all can be used to collect ammunition in the form of jellyfish or coral which can then be fired. A balloon allows SpongeBob to glide. A beating heart shows SpongeBob's health - should it get too low, he can refill it by picking up fast food items like milkshakes, fries and burgers. He can also collect spatulas - picking up 50 of them awards an extra life. Extra lives can also be found in the form of an extra pair of underpants.\n\nEvery world ends with a boss battle.

Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge.

Unfortunately Butler malfunctions and the Professor has failed to equip it with an \"off\" switch. Spyro manages to short Butler out by luring him into a power generator, then the peephole machine malfunctions and the hole in the fabric of space begins to expand rapidly.\nA terrified Professor tells Spyro about \"Hearts\" - magical objects with very special properties and the only way to control the problem. The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands. Ripto warps out Spyro along with Sparx and Butler to the Dragon Shores.\nAfter Spyro is able to travel back to the Professor's Lab and travel through the peephole's vortex to Rypto's Chateau, he finds Ripto about to lower the Professor into a pit of lava, but engages in combat with Spyro. After being defeated, Ripto captures him and Sparx. Butler reappears, and the Professor orders him to trap Ripto. Ripto, now incapacitated, yields the final heart and the Professor permanently seals the hole in space.\n\nRPG elements offer more depth than previous Spyro titles, including quests, mini-quests, and a new inventory system, creating more ways to enjoy the Dragon Realms and making this a completely new Spyro experience.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Digital Eclipse","Publisher":"VU Games","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"8db5a565-81be-4044-bbdc-b6422a50d718.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"7168c4b3-a53e-4e57-81ba-08a1c92d0618.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"616d29cf-92b0-4f64-84b1-90f0d178fa70.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"dd94fb2f-55f8-47eb-9c21-1b0d8702c8e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"5b8035e6-b5b0-4121-bb09-bf9ecd019e45.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"d97b2ec6-0fb0-43f4-91c4-e1694c656f01.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"f40be27b-e966-49c7-a334-d5da17dc1636.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"4fd971c6-b09a-4585-ba52-3c5ceb4728a8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"517b09b0-4be7-47c5-bda0-388d3416b9c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"eb209f4c-b505-4c0c-8184-8dea9462f622.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"1ea02f88-71b7-4214-ac07-f0e8486c18ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"d4555387-866b-4e6c-b1c6-e2c7ac65a9f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"5eeb4194-db69-40a1-93ff-5a0cdf164691.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3707,"FileName":"85b604fd-39fc-42a7-bea2-20d8cf4649b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":3707,"AlternateName":"Spyro Adventure","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3707,"AlternateName":"Spyro Adventure","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":3709,"Name":"Spyro: Season of Ice","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragons never seem to have had it too easy.

The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks.

But when Baby Mario falls from the sky, the Yoshis seize the opportunity to do a lot more than change diapers.\n\nThe big-hearted Yoshis vow to reunite Baby Mario with his twin brother on the far side of the island. It won't be easy, but the Yoshis are determined to take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.\n\nBrilliant game-designer Shigeru Miyamoto has crammed the island's jungles, caves and snowcapped peaks with one brain-bending surprise after another. Hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses and all-new pals await your discovery.\n\nSure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower. He can jump, hover, stomp, pound the ground and slurp up enemies. Best of all, he can throw eggs. Heck, Mario even gets to presto-chango into superfast Superstar Mario, while Yoshi morphs into a toy submarine that shoots itty-bitty torpedoes.\n\nAs an added bonus, Yoshi's Island includes six super-challenging levels developed just for the GBA. You can also take a break from baby-sitting duties to indulge in multiplayer Mario Bros. action.\n\nIn Super Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, the unlikely duo of Yoshi and Baby Mario must together brave a world of infinite surprise and challenge. Richly varied gameplay, brilliant graphics and precision control perfectly meld in an adventure you won't be able to put down!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action;

However, by the start of the 21st century, two meteors struck and destroyed much of the Earth, sending humanity into chaos. By year 179 of the Space Era, secret technology, dubbed Extra-Over Technology, or EOT, was discovered by the Earth Federal Government within a third meteor that had hit Earth at the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific. Dr. Bian Zoldark, while investigating the meteor, also found out that the creators of the Extra-Over Technology were heading to Earth to reclaim it. In order to defend earth, the government starts to develop a group of humanoid mecha, known as Personal Troopers.\nThe alien race that created Extra-Over Technology, called the Aerogaters by the Earth Federal Government, initially attacks an Earth ship sent out to investigate their presence in the far reaches of the solar system. This initial skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting them to sue for negotiations with the Earth Federation Army. Talks are arranged to take place at a secret facility in Antarctica, but the talks are targeted by a rogue faction called the Divine Crusaders.\nThe Divine Crusaders destroys the Aerogater delegation, then turn on the Federation forces. Bian Zoldark, revealing himself to be the leader of the Divine Crusaders, announces the existence of the Aerogaters to the world and rebel against the Earth Government. As Earth spins into civil war, a new Aerogater force is on the move, seeking to reclaim their lost technology...","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Banpresto","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2006-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"70f89ef0-fb16-4450-ac08-8d140aa014ff.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"9cf5a8ea-1536-41cc-a859-bc2444b7053a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"05a98f8a-8e12-4c1a-bf2f-4a49edaf5285.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"30bdf610-8de2-4d69-b48f-603202b136bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"54007440-7491-4796-9d42-c41126dcc214.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"f9aa8560-d588-4c34-b082-4df66f78d780.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"2ad2c152-6dac-40b6-aaac-fc96714bdaa7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"31d8aaab-7607-4c70-bf22-d8dcceb9d20e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"5163efd2-333e-4851-a523-ea47d4ee19f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"4f09eac6-f426-4eb2-b058-b3fdb9c30a79.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"a2747714-e210-49c1-84fa-ea2a6ada8ea6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"33bb86ae-a504-48d3-a49f-c26e24525a53.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"c5b528d2-e22b-47b9-8cc7-488ad6bd4649.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"c2ca70ba-b23b-41dc-b369-52028db892b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"55135463-303a-4362-9feb-c826a2d27fd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"b24b2d36-fd2d-4023-899a-e9fa4f4ccff4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"26a02611-295f-4acd-b9fe-dc0210e555ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"d83b5749-492e-4043-8c33-d1b527654c13.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"8b26a96b-e355-4324-81a8-66013f6a3096.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3515,"FileName":"f2364cad-220c-49f2-8258-a8a9e74ebcdf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":3515,"AlternateName":"è¶çº§æºå¨äººå¤§æï¼ååä¸çºª","Region":"China"}]},{"DatabaseID":3516,"Name":"Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The battle rages on!\n\nPeace slowly settles over the planet Earth after a brutal war against the alien armada.

Unlike most Superman games, which have a heavy action focus, Fortress of Solitude is instead primarily a puzzle game, with only minor action elements.\n\nThe game consists of twenty chapters, each consisting of a set of crystals in the Fortress of Solitude. Behind each crystal is one puzzle challenge. There are two kinds of puzzles: Kryptonex is a Sudoku variant with crystals instead of numbers. The board of cells must be filled with crystals, with only one kind of crystal per row, column and group allowed. The board is pre-filled with some crystals so players can deduce where to begin.\n\nThe second type of puzzle is called Crystallization. In this game, rows and columns must be filled with crystals. Completing a row or column energizes it and removes the crystals. The goal is to energize the entire board. Crystals (taken from a group of three, with random additions after removal) can only be placed next to other crystals that have either the same shape or color. Only wild card crystals can be placed anywhere.\n\nSuperman's powers can be used to help in puzzle completion. Each use of a power depletes a power meter which slowly recharges. In Kryptonex, Superman can show the correct crystal placement of the entire board for a short time or put the correct crystal into the current cell. In Crystallization, he can energize fields without having to complete a row or column. In both games, he can also stop the clock for a short while.\n\nThe puzzles come in three different difficulties, with higher ones being played on larger boards. Some of the crystal challenges require playing several boards in a row. All puzzles within a chapter must be completed within a time limit. It is possible to replay puzzles to improve the completion time, leaving more time for the remaining tasks. Completing a chapter unlocks a digitized picture from the movie.\n\nBesides the puzzling, there is also a small action game. During each chapter, one of Superman's arch-enemies (including the likes of Metallo, Brainiac, or Mr. Mxyzptlk) will attack and send his minions. In a side-scrolling shooter level, it is then Superman's task to shoot down the minions, who come in red and blue varieties. Red ones must be taken out with super breath; blue ones with heat vision. Shooting down a group leaves a red or blue crystal. Collecting enough crystals before the level ends is necessary to defeat the bad guy.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Santa Cruz Games","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2006-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"be6927e5-a2d8-447f-8b5c-064be06f0919.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"88d03295-2a7f-489e-a89f-812f07668226.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"86d07ea7-f308-48b8-93e9-83efa83249a9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"31f00442-762d-4ca0-911a-22ea3704f895.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"040e9a48-1f42-43ae-8802-cef40c85a167.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"8afcc32a-fb35-4ba4-a5ef-d8ce43112432.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"8de5c412-bf8c-493c-a720-d2df981d4785.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"6b4197d3-b43a-44f6-97fd-d57f35dcb4eb.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"6f1953c8-420f-498a-a906-8cc02fe0325c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"e2b54192-b514-4290-a070-084c87c72652.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"dc80bce8-bf9c-4038-ae14-4aabb401f739.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"ab82a441-a905-4c9e-89fa-b28d8e7866ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"f38d930e-ed7d-4691-bfac-50e9a845712c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22318,"FileName":"26105068-9fcf-45d3-9acb-5d91713a2136.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3726,"Name":"Superman: Countdown to Apokolips","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lois Lane has been kidnapped, and only the Man of Steel can save her!

In this game, Tak's juju magic is triggered by holding down one button and pressing combos of other buttons. Tak also earns juju powers gradually throughout the game instead of having to seek them out.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Avalanche Software","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2004-10-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"8f885762-870a-4831-ba29-490315ceefd3.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"d177c6d5-47d3-4305-a650-66c120f9f88d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"f2ac36f1-ea9b-4616-a9b2-afa14bbf3a79.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"4efa5b3e-e7ce-4055-8f67-119ac274ecf9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"daf505dc-a9ac-4987-a5db-3c3f8e77558e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"e002ac1a-d5e4-4de6-a7e7-c8a0b0fb39b9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"e588caf5-cedb-408d-bfd9-30beb2f20cf4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"af7c9441-2e26-42cf-9849-02cdc8c37072.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"87907313-4ffb-4350-b761-f7fe738c872e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"105a1b50-de0a-4efb-81b2-9be8ac294bc4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"00166e08-43d2-4253-86eb-675e3b45bbcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"205b1edf-102b-48b9-9cc8-b1ef367818b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"1564b854-6380-4c6d-aa5e-1cecfb0023ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"a37ad2cf-16fd-4304-9ef0-dcdeeb840c2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"ac994319-61ab-433f-9bfa-fa9733512bbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4040,"FileName":"b1e4aa68-c448-41f0-99dd-386db4d80133.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19863,"Name":"Tak and the Power of Juju","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tak and the Power of Juju tells a tale of good versus evil, set in an ancient world where magic really works.

Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.\n\nThe player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.\n\nBlizzard re-released the game for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The GBA port is identical to the SNES version, but the password feature has been removed and replaced with three save slots, meaning the player cannot replay any level at any time.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Blizzard Entertainment","Publisher":"Blizzard Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"c0f254cb-da25-4ff4-b54c-2b61723c221e.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"46f33e62-ee61-4910-8db5-dd3bd49140f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"07c53572-6eea-4346-9f0c-f18544da2c12.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"3635dff6-2281-48da-a5a3-3831ea0613ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"b98de262-9449-4e42-b966-e62bf89aab25.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"6df149ef-04ce-49f9-9534-ee97bc03ec62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"753754bd-beb7-4b27-ba4c-0a85a236c033.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"2e0424dd-4784-4cef-b279-32b7584da0a4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"501cbeb9-ab0b-4f3f-a0db-8b92f2b2d733.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"b1a7f45a-b741-4ba8-bfbc-533832eca222.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"e672ee4f-7c41-4e54-91e5-84ba9381058a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"a0b9f00f-2036-4dd6-b1f0-e30a4050b2a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"d8b18a7e-e7bf-4572-b837-13bb1ff28e5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"657c9e1b-919d-46c5-a0bc-9a04ce89701e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"32af88a7-e015-4814-8602-11dd57edc22f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24956,"FileName":"beb51b79-78a2-4efa-99c8-5bf58d489c90.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168147,"Name":"The Morning Adventure","ReleaseYear":"2003","Overview":"The Morning Adventure is an platforming advergame for a Spanish breakfast food known as a MaÃ±anito.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168147,"FileName":"55fdac90-660b-44dc-b9cf-1c53f911387b.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":168147,"FileName":"ef85504a-792d-444d-8c3e-e94b0df5220d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":168147,"FileName":"85fc050d-f613-4c2e-bb1d-6acf13f03621.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":168147,"FileName":"0c830fa5-5d11-41ba-8b19-495704eaa537.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":168147,"FileName":"4e62cd15-be28-4ba5-8a31-3c83708f2f66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":168147,"FileName":"1f6c9ed2-01e2-4b3c-b78a-6dd4a49e3dbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26053,"Name":"The Mummy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Mummy for the Game Boy Advance is set in the 1930s, combining exotic locations with high-adventure and action.

Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Griptonite Games","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"5583ed57-04df-482e-966a-8b50acf6f6a9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"b7d5d250-e036-4573-8dae-3334f44a8029.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"a73272b4-b89c-4f45-b071-cabef3484a75.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"cde3f76b-215a-4cad-befc-1bf10046db67.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"1c18d87c-e8f8-4773-b5b2-3b605c6bf653.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"90eb2119-a421-4875-b6f0-a71af3a7d196.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"2e347a0c-c81e-4c4e-9f6e-19b3ad7d019f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"93094a69-ab70-46eb-9795-b9c6fce3f0ee.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"47ae1d5f-4e76-43c4-b4c8-ca6d0f6c7168.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"5b10d141-3653-433e-8d2b-91047812ae79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"ae96273f-5cef-467e-baea-a4549f903ca2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"b0f0476f-7590-4da7-852f-6c3b67c26c75.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"36fb2749-7ea0-4cfa-b67d-81e606371c64.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"03953f6d-9938-440f-ab6c-64aa33ff6418.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"073e1568-795e-4281-9132-cad7aa597a99.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"31d0ebd5-9996-44f4-871b-9f82bc1720ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"51020415-18a7-4655-9a8c-0f6601e8aefe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"c9ebf4ab-1ac1-4816-a0b3-b70060dc5970.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"627aac02-caf1-4d07-8dfc-34c2690c9ac0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3688,"FileName":"ac8841a3-6676-4073-b20c-0d43b89bf6e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":3688,"AlternateName":"Los Sims: Toman la Calle","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":22305,"Name":"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An all-new adventure for SpongeBob SquarePants, based on the animated feature film.

Square off a against a field of tough AI opponents, practice a few holes by yourself, or link up and get as many as four virtual golfers chipping and putting.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Rebellion","Publisher":"Destination Software","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"827f7f78-2614-403b-8caa-abd711a31147.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"a8ae0197-7b91-4c43-aced-821167cd89b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"1fd29c57-f160-4584-957d-e841faef17be.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"3cc07508-398f-49f6-973c-da4f8f2ceeea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"805c7e26-0f32-48c5-ad3c-6bbee2f5fabf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"361736b8-d57d-425a-98d0-cad68590eca4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"c1dba730-f33c-49d5-ad69-ae42fd65fa69.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"6bccb276-51dc-46d3-a81e-7375eb5669bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"24aa5c28-e046-41b7-80ae-ded640165f26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"95f5b61e-9842-44c1-906a-04a83f42c46c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"456477dd-6b2f-44dd-9eb6-c59563cd1614.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22325,"FileName":"6195c52c-3e21-43c8-823d-68ee95ad2f59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20896,"Name":"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Much to the dismay of Jack Skellington and the citizens of Halloween Town, unusual bugs have started to infest their township.

It simulates football matches through players taking turns to throw dice for attack and defense moves. Combinations are formed through multiple throws of three blue dice (attack). Further gameplay also involves a white one (more risk through double or nothing), a green one, and a red one (defense). The concept borrows some elements from poker dice with risk assessment based on retaining dice after the first throw. The gameplay involves different types of shots, but also penalties and foul cards (causing a player to wait a turn).\n\nAt the start of the game the original or the arcade mode needs to be chosen. In the original mode all actions are shown on a stadium board, while the arcade mode shows the actual shots and the keeper's defense. Further options then include training, a versus game, a friendly match or a full cup. In the training mode shots can be practiced as in a regular football game, by timing a button press for power and then determining a direction for the shot. Each type of shot (lob, volley, penalty ...) has slightly different game mechanics, with both offensive and defensive sides. The game includes a selection of French teams and countries playing in the World Cup. The versus mode can be played against another player using a Link cable.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Titanium Studios","Publisher":"Titus","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":168146,"FileName":"8f02ee07-5786-4695-8426-3e76f0e6f15d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168146,"FileName":"162ed249-ba9d-49fe-b9b3-9868e468c002.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168146,"FileName":"72cfc087-60d4-4257-878a-1573afb76a3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168146,"FileName":"e1bb69cd-5c3e-44b9-9779-bc6c2905a92f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156274,"Name":"Titeuf : MÃ©ga-Compet'","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Titeuf : MÃ©ga-Compet' est un jeu vidÃ©o de type party game, dÃ©veloppÃ© par Eden Games et Ã©ditÃ© par Atari, commercialisÃ© le 24 septembre 2004 sur PlayStation 2 et Microsoft Windows, et le 1er octobre 2004 sur Game Boy Advance.

Players control Titeuf as he attempts to play tricks on people in his environment. The challenge mode consists of a series of levels with specific objects. In each one Titeuf runs around in an environment such as the school or a playground. He can pick up objects such as bananas, firecrackers, exploding cans, toy cars etc. He needs to launch these at the people in the environment to scare them or to make them slip. The opponents have three alert states: blue, yellow and red. Blue means it is safe to launch the object, yellow means he is spotted and red makes them chase after Titeuf.\n\nTiteuf can be moved in eight directions. He receives points (trophies) for completing a gag. When an enemy has a red alert state, the player quickly need to press B to sprint and avoid a confrontation. If he is caught, a life (a red star) is lost, but additional ones can be picked up sometimes. After a while chasing opponents will become tired and return to a blue state. There are various objectives to complete, such as performing a number of gags, collecting other types of items, or sprinting for a certain amount of time. When the objective is complete, the exit is opened up. After each completed challenge Titeuf's performance is rated, also taking into account the amount of time. The second mode, crash test, is a practice mode where all objects are available right away, there is an unlimited amount of lives and there is no time limit.

Typical trucks such as Mighty Dump, Mighty Front Loader, Toughest Mighty, Mighty Cement Mixer, Mighty Crane and others are used in different scenarios to build foundations, dig canals, clear trees and more. Every job starts at the Tonka Garage by deploying a vehicle. The gameplay is shown from a bird's-eye view in small 2D-scrolling environments with dirt yards, cities, gravel pits and forests. Every vehicle has a specific use. For instance, Mighty Dump can carry up to four loads of dirt and can dump the load anywhere. Jobs gradually become more complex as more vehicles are available and the player has to switch between them to complete the task. For instance the Mighty Front Loader is used to pick up certain types of dirt to load it onto the Mighty Dump which can transport it more efficiently. Once deployed it is possible to switch between vehicles on the fly.\n\nSometimes additional tasks appear during a job with a time limit, such as unexpected fires that can be put out with the Rescue Fire Truck. Completing these is usually not required, but rewarded with bonus fuel. The performance per job is rated with up to three stars. Next to completing a job the game for instance also takes into account fuel efficiency, which is at its best if no redundant driving is done and the vehicle stays on the roads as much as possible. Later levels introduce dodging traffic. Special actions tied to specific vehicles also require more fuel. Most tasks have specific steps such as clearing, grading and constructing, but these do not always need to be completed in a fixed order. Often there are multiple approaches or solutions to get the job done.\n\nThe game can be played as a series of jobs or with freeplay for unlimited construction and destruction through deformable moments. The GBA version contains 11 trucks and the PC version 13. While the PC version has a much higher resolution with sharper graphics drawn in a different style, the content itself including the gameplay and scenarios is largely identical.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Webfoot Technologies","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2006-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"4a19db63-339d-42bb-b8cc-db83e3344f80.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"d2b38b6d-7093-4ae4-bfb0-50713cd94f76.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"a3fcfb32-7962-4200-8de1-1d5dea08ea77.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"c0533201-a6c0-4e78-921c-4e7c5e1785fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"0f3a0f1f-3649-4c48-99e3-429d60814da2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"470a4e9f-b683-42e8-b7d8-86ea6e8aefc2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32758,"FileName":"b7a238b6-45b6-4594-9f6b-719bbcb718e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22326,"Name":"Tony Hawk's American Sk8land","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Activision invites players to hit the streets of Las Angeles and show off their movies in TONY HAWK'S AMERICAN SK8LAND for the Gba.

There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.\n\nAll the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHcpLwKq900","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Vicarious Visions","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"06b4baf4-db06-43ea-b5a4-af92fc9eafe9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"533824c2-0124-4e8c-9ad4-9270fb2207a1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"c85d02ce-5743-4e48-b677-017416be8af8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"9f5e0a33-bcd2-4a52-9f0c-c5288dc62ae1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"0646bafc-ded6-4312-8e9c-7d3306de5043.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"a6057fe9-378e-49d2-b2cd-d13c05e20e6c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"235ce636-a59b-4dbd-9e6d-91d3924dbbb0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"dda6153b-de06-4ef6-98f5-3151187734cb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"9fa5adfc-8c59-46d1-8613-76d7e2f3a5ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"d72e3427-409d-4344-9913-6965c63d9b0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4121,"FileName":"f141af96-7ebd-41a4-9b3d-7eccf03ad042.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4122,"Name":"Tony Hawk's Underground","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Activision's definitive skateboarding game returns on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance and PC with Tony Hawk's Underground.

Eventually, players will find themselves facing off against big name tennis stars like Andy Roddick, Venus Williams, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, and Lleyton Hewitt.

Players race along the track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain speed is reached, and the \"Trick Star\" appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost.\n\nIn League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and progress to the next set of tracks.\n\nTrick Star also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results are shown.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Tantalus Interactive","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2006-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"f260d573-ef9a-4958-90b4-c486838a21d3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"341d646d-f308-47f5-8a42-a953aeec2c34.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"5eb1f912-189c-4ce8-adb8-bea6a939e336.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"59e2730f-b356-4dc2-b8db-49aaa741e55d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"fde8e16e-6a81-4c07-bac4-13d5f73c807e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"4a361c1c-81d6-4a03-a36e-98579ce73930.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"e9a3f812-8eb8-42e8-918c-d86826d3cfc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32701,"FileName":"e2670c19-72ed-48af-ac2e-42f20246bee7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26150,"Name":"Tringo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tringo combines elements of puzzle games and bingo in a challenging brain-twister.

The sprite graphics of Ty and his pals have been rendered from the 3D assets of the console bigger brother to retain a consistent feel throughout the game design.

Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Vicarious Visions","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"0a30fe84-5fae-4792-8105-a7552b046e35.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"14093fe3-cdfc-452c-9626-21a3e546a63c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"9451abff-d05b-47f1-955a-335f9464f158.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"e2d27a38-5a1f-4e8b-8580-981118b3155b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"388f8e78-f407-4ad8-88f2-83e066f4e84c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"265ad43d-69b8-4824-838a-7079f023f811.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"d892ab77-6259-4561-8c8a-da1ed085cc37.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"91eb5a1a-cb37-4940-80c7-951086307b44.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"67d0594a-9a1f-4a60-a720-2a6e2aee824e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"05f06450-475b-4219-8472-c940e873a44d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"e38af631-5656-4f12-a2f3-b775caa61a4d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"06f20907-749f-4586-8996-18b8b662b039.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"594e2802-03eb-4b05-884e-ebbf3b861fd1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"a21d1915-2d67-414d-89cc-3b43734860f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"bafb5356-0607-4069-b22c-ab4b0035a3b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"460951c7-88ec-4bef-b37c-00eb3ba960bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"fc562390-2365-487a-98e3-ad4d61a3350b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"50dab162-b97c-40d0-824f-58a933db363e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20823,"FileName":"bc00e908-abe0-4707-acd7-a079e27d4fff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4132,"Name":"Ultimate Winter Games","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ultimate Winter Games features four different Olympic-style events to play: Downhill Skiing, Snowboarding, Bobsled, and Curling.

Woody must face the same types of challenges he faced in previous five worlds as he heads toward the throne to meet the demon that occupies Crazy Castle.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io5tGs-Rlhk","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Tantalus Interactive","Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"0f6a622d-bcc7-4835-8ec4-a4dc49dc949a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"29044993-4c33-4f9e-8467-2911d1cf9fba.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"3b20b9ce-19c5-4bf7-81fb-0925e660017d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"55a2ca83-d0a0-4a43-8041-24eb85102d58.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"a5eae9d4-7acb-4d40-aa3b-c4c58719a447.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"2c444d7a-2e74-45f8-88d4-9717a6eb6f38.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"6c9ae259-249b-4671-bb7d-d22f7975faae.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"0ac4946e-a32a-4268-973b-91b8af0d39c3.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"e8e7afb2-3a77-474a-b91b-e92e50ade06f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"a9fdc517-5da7-4245-96a7-775062abc38d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"76f36463-4123-4ff0-898b-341b0b9bf3f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"c140704a-3eda-4672-8b9b-11a14d21ee26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"e39b6afc-7fdb-4663-87fa-597e2b240bc1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"9e9d7302-5675-40d0-9301-76c1c43ee948.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"fa29f854-8fe9-4763-b666-d6f4b7102169.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"b093f88d-47db-4b15-bdc7-8f33bd191e38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"033be7b2-26c0-4df2-8fd8-fef249970165.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"ffb6dc7b-4518-48c2-8482-d1af946a6788.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26139,"FileName":"0a4e0c22-253f-4e93-817a-ea6609241b7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":26139,"AlternateName":"Woody Woodpecker: Crazy Castle 5","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":91316,"Name":"Word Safari: The Friendship Totems","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Word Safari combines the best of adventure video gaming with true learning content.

There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka.

The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations.\n\nThe worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm.

However, one day Yusuke tried to save a little boy, and was killed in the process. Unlike most of us, he has been given a second chance: he can continue living if he agrees to become a \"Spirit Detective\", a supernatural fighter who hunts down demons that plague our world. So the young man is back to his school life, with only a few people aware of his new secret identity...\n\nBased on the initial chapters of the Yu Yu Hakusho manga, Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective is an isometric action role-playing game. The player can switch between various characters from the manga and anime, including Yusuke himself, his rival Kuwabara, his love interest Kayko, and others. Most of the game consists of accepting and completing missions, which usually involve tracking down and eliminating specific demons. The characters can fight with bare hands or use special \"spirit attacks\". Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. Once a character levels up, he/she can learn more moves (punching, kicking, etc.) and new spirit attacks, up to three per character.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocCsnUrUOf4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sensory Sweep","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"357cc76d-2094-4540-a8b2-6b862f99d8a0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"3b16fb51-45a1-47eb-a24a-430be77e4859.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"c4a94f32-2c8b-4451-bb5c-e51e741087e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"e1e81d20-3bdb-414b-b2c8-2bdb20747720.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"e7c94ab2-066d-47d4-a958-dfdc2e499325.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"8e5aaaf1-8f50-40e9-9cd7-b362eee7d918.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"3ca629d4-4a53-43c3-8515-71c59fbdcc4d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"c80f20b0-93d0-4b69-bdb6-750e69618a33.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"cb180e57-0727-4c58-8121-41acf7226ad7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"f7337932-2453-4948-aee5-005580fea38f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4151,"FileName":"0ed2c19a-2a18-4d51-945e-eb3c85354b3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4151,"AlternateName":"Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files: Spirit Detective","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4151,"AlternateName":"Yu Yu Hakusho - Spirit Detective","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":4152,"Name":"Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files: Tournament Tactics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Yu Yu Hakusho Tournament Tactics follows the Dark Tournament storyline of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime series.

The premise of the cartoon and comic books revolves around a group of magical alien-like creatures known as the mamodos that have come to Earth to fight for their world's crown. The only problem is that they have to use humans in order to access their powerful spells. The main characters are a fourteen-year-old human named Kiyo and a mamodo boy named Zatch. The game offers players the opportunity to play as several different characters as well as several different modes. Like to play air, this does allow for a variety that will keep players engrossed in the world of the game for extended periods of time, but one of the modes allows for a link up to fight it out multiplayer style. In the game a team of players face off against another team in a basic two-dimensional background much like fighter games of the past. In order to win, a team must win two out of three matches, and although the human character is the only one that can take damage the two characters must always move together. Fans of the characters will quickly become reacquainted with the characters and story, and newcomers to the series will have fun learning what it's all about through ZATCH BELL: ELECTRIC ARENA.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"Dimps","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"ea1ffe23-d9be-4419-8fcb-88e8e56c2868.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"62f63b51-b1e6-4826-ae14-1e595de0d56a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"31fd3402-b8d0-4b68-a010-7f5fd8c48587.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"555bb32b-35a2-4d8f-893b-9e4e2cccee3f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"ca966fd4-92a7-47e1-b1fc-4f58a5078e73.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"1b82ed2b-cba0-4075-8603-22b8da62607c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"b17ccf89-2f20-4418-b606-a9c0addd86d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"ebe6d9e6-3b19-4458-96c6-3fb26b500ddc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"6afd0620-fd16-494b-9acc-f6a69df7bf56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"8e7f3f3f-636d-4551-9fca-5fdf0dfa987c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"a0b5a586-fb8a-4478-81e9-c442afa06328.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27896,"FileName":"90e1dd22-65de-46eb-a932-60ba42f0959a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":27896,"AlternateName":"Konjiki no Gashbell!! - Unare!

You take control of a young man who, after a series of events, finds himself in possession of a new type of L.E.V. (a giant combat robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces with the Anti-Terrestrial League.\n\nZone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars is a side-story in the Zone of the Enders series. The gameplay alternates between story sequences and tactical turn-based combat, in which the player controls a number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, durability, movement range and armament. Unlike close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. (interactive action system) comes into play. When attacking, the player is given a limited amount of time to move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an enemy, the player must try to keep his/her own target icon away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on and off in the options menu.\n\nAt the end of each chapter the player is able to upgrade the controlled L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can sometimes be found during missions. The \"balance\" sub-screen allows to determine whether an L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, evasion or minimizing damage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WjuDp1sb40","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Winky Soft","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2002-02-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"c34eb9f1-6d6f-48f1-a110-22cededa5cee.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"d40faf12-6234-450c-bdc5-bd624bcf44b4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"f6662bdf-cb27-48e9-809a-12f03884dd01.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"c50006ec-6608-4109-81c8-5a2a86206911.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"5255925b-9b71-48b1-8d3f-864aa4d0905c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"da7d75bd-0c62-46dc-bb10-edbb0b1e8869.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"afcf7af3-dfa3-405e-bdc0-233f70d09ce2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"8335f0f1-19ec-4743-83c9-c7f61722922c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"874be911-7c2f-48f5-83e4-5fab7e3df2e7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"17ebb2d9-907c-4ce4-a430-1ed5b6547f8e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"79061355-92a6-4c22-8e14-e77149e4bef8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"1a25d2ac-8fdd-4783-8369-4a44aa14cb4f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"26249018-75d9-4f0e-ba80-80f8c88759c7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"c87dc703-1d65-48f0-86ff-778ff38d61ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"16550f5e-1bd5-4ae4-816d-44cac324dad9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"6797391a-8f37-45bc-8dbd-abf20eae7a27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"935e1a3a-4ae8-4d3d-9003-8c91b780b349.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"62543490-3d79-46d4-8964-9a18a5c71057.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"968444d3-7aab-4d8f-add6-83c9451efbcd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4154,"FileName":"c3db5b5e-ce8c-4986-9d17-c825bfffc61f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4154,"AlternateName":"Z.O.E. 2173: Testament","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":4155,"Name":"ZooCube","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Created by PuzzleKings, ZooCube takes puzzlers to a whole new dimension - the third dimension.
