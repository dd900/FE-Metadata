Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWwgY2CVKTE","Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"SIMS","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"4932cc7c-4516-495a-ad8e-710e3844e0f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"e434114a-d5d8-4bf0-8efb-8a5faaa62d1c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"91c04c78-fbda-4b2c-9f0f-41b6c4e115a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"88eec3ba-6726-4751-8ba8-854d361411d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"f3a9b016-0205-44fe-8a33-8feffba3c778.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"7b6e587f-71cb-42bf-8948-3e683c96bd66.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"d70e7321-e3a9-4e69-9ace-30ac9e2b0334.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"a17dd2df-8039-46a7-935f-c0aa501044e9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"35b26553-9634-422f-8501-cac8dd6b0146.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"831a494d-615b-40c4-a87f-f949e53515be.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"6bbdd126-9f53-4766-bac2-af0589a3819b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"56240fa6-8be1-414d-8caa-6cc78f9b7ba1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"8103c666-b3d1-4a99-8fb3-b026a11ef2e6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"4b38ca7f-0d45-4e45-96cd-45365abb44b1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"dfc774e9-aa22-49a4-9d3d-6b8733422fe4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"c5b32ea1-19fe-4ba1-8636-672e4102b259.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"70c2b20f-a8a5-48be-93c8-2947c34ff222.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"f70eeefa-5a33-4938-8013-bf775b9e2413.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"1252a975-f6b2-45cd-ac47-1b36e2bd39e9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"d2e57afa-61b2-4797-a2a5-f31f460281e0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"66e751c2-33bc-447e-8740-9a0fceecc1ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"6879303b-10b4-44fd-a073-4fd17b0a512f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"73e445d7-f55a-4e32-a2a4-efad2d4f6160.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"9f0a9a68-09ff-4c69-ba2e-e4e3480e11c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2867,"FileName":"e86895f8-983c-4bbb-af34-05ef37034571.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200091,"Name":"Alex Kidd 3: Curse in Miracle World","ReleaseYear":"2021","Overview":"Here is the last post for my Alex Kidd fan game.\nI am happy to close this chapter which will have lasted several years.\nTo all the people who have followed and supported me, thank you very much!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Platform","Developer":"Yeti Bomar","Publisher":"Yeti Bomar","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":200091,"FileName":"32b67946-0091-4a23-adeb-3adaea5b495c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200091,"FileName":"3243db09-3090-46e5-a12b-d8018df866de.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200091,"FileName":"eaee74f7-580c-460b-97b5-fe4e65af0863.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200091,"FileName":"1a96d201-5805-4b4b-a807-cd3151338356.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200091,"FileName":"2f470ddf-adb0-4fef-b024-cc2233856718.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2684,"Name":"Alex Kidd in Miracle World","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your name is Alex Kidd.

The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. \n\nIf you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying \"I haven't got anything\". That's when they will be replaced by bandits. \n\nSome men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"64440a53-2852-435e-9df3-bffc22e64922.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"4c68d1af-c4f4-4bf5-95a6-0ad16fdb8be3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"c1aeb9e2-2d70-4820-bd4f-80332ca6167f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"65852681-ffbf-4e96-bd3e-0d4f1e56482c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"09eade4a-ec4c-46e7-8411-d0c1c3b0d57f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"6606c648-27c9-46a8-bb7f-b506078c46c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"5d5e23da-e336-439f-b116-9c8ecd16a92e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"aaf79aab-92ee-4679-a874-8d0a3c90fdae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"3a0d145e-ec3f-4051-8c41-99aedacc632b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"2d753ee5-2433-4857-8496-c951c9762625.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"51192aa0-0378-4bbf-8202-e39b44d4d191.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"45a1b649-dd79-4dd7-8365-c63c8c62d60e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"21d70087-b35e-4bb4-9033-15d749e67833.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"325e35cb-f6c0-49ff-9ab8-237d6c8a1ce2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2702,"FileName":"9a15498d-c5c8-401a-a14f-86d85fb4f076.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2703,"Name":"Basketball Nightmare","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"You are the captain of the Hometown High School's basketball team.

To solve this demographic problem comes Chapolim!\n\nChapolim X Drácula: Um Duelo Assustador (which translates Chapolim vs. Dracula: A Frightening Duel) is an authorized \"hack\" of Ghost House, with Ghost House's hero, Mick, replaced by Chapolim (or El Chapulín Colorado in original Spanish), a famous Mexican character from a TV series. Chapolim is a parody to superheroes in general. He dresses a red grasshopper costume with a yellow heart in the chest with the leters \"CH\". He also usually carries his Marreta Biônica (Chipote Chillón in the original, Squeaky Mallet in English) a red (toy) hammer.\n\nAt each stage, Chapolim must defeat five vampires that are in torpor within their coffins. The coffins are locked, so he must first find the keys to unlock them. He'll find the keys killing the most diverse enemies that haunt the mansion he's in, such as ghosts, bats, fire blowers, mummies, etc. Once he's got a key, he must unlock a coffin and then defeat the vampire who sleeps there.\n\nIn order to kill his enemies, Chapolim can jump over them or punch them.

Gameplay is very similar to Punch-Out!!: players are given the option to block the opponent's attempted punches, evade in two different directions, and throwing a wide variety of punches. Victory in a match can be won by knockout, technical knockout or by decision. A knockout requires a boxer to knock his opponent down four times in a three-round match; on the fourth knockdown, the downed boxer will fail to answer the 10-count. A technical knockout is awarded if a boxer is knocked down three times in a single round. If neither of these occur by the end of the third and final round, one boxer is declared the winner by a judge's decision, which is determined by each boxer's punches thrown and landed, knockdowns and total damage done.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"SIMS Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Flying Edge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"38fe5475-f710-401f-97f1-c00eda5790b4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"de195a89-158c-4c04-b223-a1e74e1d69e3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"76a28fa6-e2b2-49fd-b897-eb81a2224815.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"b493a914-e968-4c72-8027-36c7cba7b961.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"ec491b5d-1606-4e59-983f-8d4e51569276.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"6f88363a-a566-4543-aaab-a4edaf2fc98c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"b367187c-dedb-4d13-afe4-65ab43e77b63.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":161937,"FileName":"e51a6b3c-17be-4315-8200-c1005be3a29f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122368,"Name":"Geraldinho","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Geraldinho is a retooled version of Teddy Boy, produced by Tec Toy and released exclusively in Brazil.

The player controls Popolon and Aphrodite, entering the evil priest Galious' castle to free their yet-to-be-born son Pampas from the priest's evil clutches. Being able to control Popolon and Aphrodite means the player can switch between two characters that have slightly different abilities. For example, Popolon can push stones and open heavy doors. On the other hand, Aphrodite survives longer under water and she can shoot more projectiles. Should either character die, the other can visit a shrine and pay for resurrection.

All of them involve problem solving and for every problem solved your character will move forward eventually reaching the end of the screen and clearing the stage. Your opponent varies depending on the speed setting set at the options screen. For example, if you choose Snail you will race a Moto Bug, but when hare is selected you will race a much faster Rabbit, and the time limit is decreased.\n\nMost of the levels involve find the word puzzles where you have to spell out a word using the available letters. These levels are sometimes interrupted by a match the letters segment, where you must find a certain amount of matching letters among the available letters shown onscreen. The match the letters segment is somewhat broken because sometimes no matching letters are ever shown, or actually matching the letters may give a wrong answer anyway. In those cases you have to select the wrong answer to get the right answer.\n\nOther levels involve solving mathematical equations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Tiertex","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"948a912c-57be-4831-ba19-714bb76044d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"08b0b2f4-ffe6-418f-8e19-a4cc3ee89764.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"43da4c69-3946-40fe-97e3-f64b0e6374a4.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"f865edae-a174-4e22-8e1b-44d26c605151.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"830ed6b4-52ae-4aa1-bc7d-10bb093b6ea4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"9cbd430f-568e-4ec1-a23e-232de3630443.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"9ca9bae6-379d-493d-85cf-1362c2bc1b7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3018,"FileName":"38d65878-226c-4e92-9a1d-49c525113260.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3019,"Name":"Space Gun","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"From a crippled starship at the edge of the galaxy comes a cry for help.

It is not a port of any specific version of Street Fighter II, but rather it is a mix between the Mega Drive versions of Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition and Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, mixing elements from both. The title itself, Street Fighter II', features the same blue fonts as the Champion Edition logo, as well as the prime symbol (') next to the numeral, which is pronounced Dash in Japan, but is usually unspoken overseas.\n\nThough severely watered down due to the weaker hardware of the SMS, this version of Street Fighter II is still a reasonably faithful rendition of the game. It also features the announcer's vocals which the Mega Drive's Special Champion Edition lacked. However, the game is held back by a lack of moves (the Master System only has two buttons on its controller, as opposed to the six used in the arcade game) and character voice samples, and the framerate is low. The music has also been tweaked in places.\n\nThe SMS version only retains 8 fighters out of the 12 character roster from Special Champion Edition. E. Honda, Zangief, Dhalsim and Vega (Claw) are the four fighters who did not made the cut. None of the additional fighters from New Challengers (Cammy, T. Hawk, Fei-Long and Dee-Jay) are present either, despite the use of character portraits from that version.\n\nThe character-specific endings are also not present in this version either: instead the ending screen consists of portraits of Balrog, Sagat and M. Bison (the same ones used in Special Champion Edition when the player clears the game using a boss character) with a generic message underneath. The staff roll is also lifted straight from Special Champion Editon, but with the addition of people who worked specifically on this version.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Tec Toy","Publisher":"Tec Toy","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"dc445c8d-57d3-4377-a20a-b96bd7dbab8f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"0d2de66c-7bfb-474d-8fa5-61ab0fb74beb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"44927874-8f63-42c3-8fee-a541fc1f9d13.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"f69af7b8-bf5a-4bfd-9093-39be753d54bc.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"5d080f79-bbaa-4a4a-959e-099ef01dc4b6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"3e0088d3-6962-4f98-aa6f-6198b60e60f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"edd1930b-f6be-41e7-a95e-56e8d83b60f5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"f75d6d9b-8ac7-4177-9554-a5ccd935b45e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"50d35278-05c1-4783-9666-8e42ccdb35e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"8fdc50c7-2216-447b-8681-8e418abafd14.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"3fe42b4f-537c-4168-8d80-4eb415e890ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":3031,"FileName":"5c13fc5d-6e63-41ad-96da-060d2fd80291.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Brazil"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26745,"Name":"Street Master","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Street Master is an unlicensed port of Street Fighter I.

The series follows a Japanese schoolgirl who has chosen to fight crime after flaunting the law herself one too many times. Her only notable characteristic, as far as this game is concerned, is the use of a weaponized metal yo-yo to pummel her foes.\n\nThe game is one part brawler, pitting the main character Suki against either a wave of criminals which she must defeat en masse or a single boss with a considerable amount of strength and health. The rest of the game is presented as a first-person adventure game, like Portopia and other text and point and click adventures available for Japanese home computers at the time. The player's actions in one mode generally leads them to the other, as enemies are met in the adventure's story and are then summarily dealt with in the brawler mode.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Master System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"df6c0a7e-a7e6-43b0-b7cc-69e40f7b64af.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"dce8d407-a220-43a6-bae0-5df15b6aec7c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"9f2741fc-bc9a-4667-b210-f94cf83e0fa3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"a40975a7-e959-4275-8cc6-0c0dc374fe6a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"646c9399-2977-4fd2-9c38-5bde47550fc7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"d52cadee-9b83-4acf-be4b-7e4ffdd37b2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"9625f8e8-6fdf-4c15-86f1-6b9b95d5fbf3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3037,"FileName":"f29c6648-6913-41a7-9c65-b04d5b1cc457.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3038,"Name":"Summer Games","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"The ceremonial flame is lit, the pigeons released... the Summer Games have officially begun!
