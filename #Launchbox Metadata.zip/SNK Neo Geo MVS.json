{"Name":"SNK Neo Geo MVS","Games":[{"DatabaseID":6466,"Name":"Bang Bead","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bang Bead, known in Japan as Bang Beads (バンビーズ?), is a ball-and-paddle game developed and published by Visco exclusively for the arcade cabinet known as the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware. Bang Bead was one of two Visco-developed games being considered for release in 2000, alongside Bang² Busters. Ultimately only Bang Bead saw a release, which was very limited and exclusively distributed in Europe. This release was so scarce that, when it first surfaced, it was rumoured to be a leaked prototype and not an official release; this rumour was dispelled once full kits began to surface, but to this day certain websites still incorrectly label it a prototype.\n\nYou can select from 9 characters and play against another player or the computer. Knock out the stars behind the other player then get the bouncing ball through to win the round.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo MVS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Visco Corporation","Publisher":"Visco Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"431873f2-4487-43f0-b27d-4bc454a6ef03.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"a358a73c-d056-433f-8fd6-a091cdd58ede.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"dfe03b42-4b4d-4b12-8878-22eba53e3a72.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"87be5b59-d89a-4db6-a8ff-be29ac8805bb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"ef5976ec-839a-41fb-8102-d70a8e192ae9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"9de527b0-e7b0-491d-8f19-7390e398ccee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"381ff4fc-bf05-448b-b555-911ea6608aae.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"e80dc8e0-4e9a-40ca-b43c-6a3753dbc061.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"2bc97a92-03da-42dd-b862-177e95332d94.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"7877d92b-5ae0-4b39-8b41-0dd353e582f7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"ad414e7a-49a6-4db2-ae65-23598900c102.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"31668cc5-1f64-4fd5-83ca-154cffbe7f3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":6466,"FileName":"ca9cd901-1425-4728-afa1-1c9cdde3b5f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":6466,"AlternateName":"Bang Bead","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":127207,"Name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","ReleaseYear":"2003","Overview":"Released in March 2003.
