All the blocks are attracted to a magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at the south of the field and then puts it to the north what was the top of the block pile will now be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was the bottom.

It uses the characters from Tekken 3, including an exclusive playable character to the game, Crow, which was previously appeared as NPCs in the original.\n\nTekken Card Challenge utilizes a system similar to its Pok√©mon counterpart. Two opponents are to fight at a time, with various cards for different maneuvers and a 100 point HP total for damage accumulation. The player begins with a hand of four cards, drawing more as the duel proceeds. The battle system is similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! in that the three types of cards perform in a rock, paper, and scissors pattern. Attack cards are played against each other to compare values with the loser being discarded and deducting HP, an attack card played against a defense nullifies each other (except in the case of a counter), and two block cards cancel each other out. There is also a minor system of air juggling, which can be quite damaging given the correct order of cards.\n\nTekken Card Challenge also provides the player with a variety of game modes. There is a link mode via Communication Cable to connect two WonderSwans for a fight, 1-player battle, and (the main mode) Adventure, which allows the player to unlock more characters and duel opponents. In adventure mode, the player is given movement of a character sprite in a full environment taken place on a 15 x 15 square grid to traverse. The point of each stage is to defeat each \"duelist\" given limited number of steps and gain entrance to the exit.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"WonderSwan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1999-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"a823ce49-0964-4fee-b5cd-bd91acfa80b7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"6ace1257-76c6-4fee-b33a-d27b609d25b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"94d43428-8989-45d3-a35b-51ae51baedb1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"6346e1b5-62f9-40ae-8bfe-0e1983d1bf0c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"4507aa5e-e1dd-4432-a0ad-e84084309cc8.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"ca5fdc7e-9a8d-444f-b58d-bd37963a3b2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27674,"FileName":"c2fca42f-fafe-4d51-bbb9-d5dcc9d4f588.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200872,"Name":"Tenori-on","ReleaseYear":"2000","Overview":"Toshio Iwai, creator of the DS title Electroplankton, also developed the digital musical instrument Tenori-on with Yamaha in 2007.
