One day, a group of peasants approach the castle, and the elder tells Gabriel about a terrible death of a little girl, who was killed by a vicious wolf. Suspecting the wolf could be a supernatural creature, the peasant asks the Schattenjaeger to purge the evil. The investigation brings Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura to the mysterious Hunter Society and to Bavaria's dark past.\n\nThe game utilizes a cast of live actors and full-motion video technology: the actors are filmed over photorealistic images of Munich and its surroundings, and nearly every interaction with the environment leads to a FMV sequence. Despite its visual style, The Beast Within is not an interactive movie, but a full-fledged adventure game with many dialogues, detective work to do, and puzzles to solve. Unlike the first game, it is entirely controlled through point-and-click actions - all the icons have been replaced by a single cursor. Both Gabriel and Grace are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6cEbsrPBulo"},"11473":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microsoft","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2da92ad6-64c3-4ae4-8fa6-36e72de91c3a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"77994328-9512-4d89-bc1a-2e5df1e28518.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a2d27f6-b2e4-4ef0-9385-95f5eeff97d5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"985c107e-6cab-447a-a5c9-a8552a26d769.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2176e429-6f93-491f-9164-1f00228e3ba9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SkiFree","Overview":"SkiFree is a computer game created by Chris Pirih, who was working as a programmer at Microsoft at the time.

With Elmo as their guide, children explore the neighborhood and visit with many Sesame Street characters. Eight activities will acquaint children with numbers, counting, spatial relationships, and other pre-math essentials. There is also a special interactive phone used to call favorite Muppets, as well as interactive storybooks, televisions, and radios. The games include the Present Game, the Paper Clip Game, the Near and Far Game, and \"I've Got Your Number.\" As players explore Sesame Street, they will encounter characters and games. The Present Game is a number identification and counting activity hosted by Elmo. He will ask for a certain number of objects. Objects are then placed inside a big box and he counts them. If he's given the number he asked for, a fireworks display will appear. If not, players may try again. In the Paper Clip game Ernie has hidden all of Bert's paper clips and needs help in finding them. Ernie will give children clues as they search his apartment. This game teaches identification of shapes by their physical characteristics. The Near and Far Game takes place in Big Bird's Nest and reinforces listening and deductive reasoning skills as well as the concepts of near and far. Big Bird hides his birdseed and players must hunt for it all around his nest. As children search and click on objects in his nest, he will tell them whether they are \"near\" or '\"far\" from the birdseed. In \"I've Got Your Number\" elementary addition and subtraction skills are emphasized. Bats are hiding behind one of the numbers in Count Von Count's Castle. The Count will offer clues for the correct number.","Publisher":"The Learning Company","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=intBZz1Ft4Y"},"136940":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Media Station, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Vehicle Simulation; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"781b3fa3-63fa-4a45-ac63-723c37866cd5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fbc44fcb-7fb8-4074-aa96-92dcf3ec173a.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7f9cf583-b23e-4780-898d-e4b69a35700f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7cb09f9c-aee8-4161-bb02-84816cf094bb.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"090e6c80-63eb-4692-ad5b-c227c4a74946.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"27922cec-d2d8-4292-b3b4-61e5f0b6aa7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"23a9832f-9660-45a2-bd9b-5c42b423f884.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tonka Search & Rescue","Overview":"From rescuing to repairing, Search & Rescue has a variety of missions and activities to choose from.

However, it does not continue the Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar saga, but instead starts a new tale set in a different fantasy world, known as Ramar.\n\nThe story begins with William Escobar, the son of the governor of Pianda, sailing home to meet his fiancee. The ship is attacked by pirates, and William escapes in a life boat with a mortally wounded traveler. Before he dies, the stranger gives William a medallion, warning him of a conspiracy against the Empire. William meets a young magician named Aren, who has just discovered devastating powers within himself, and the two decide to meet William's father and ask for his advice concerning the unsettling information.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to Betrayal at Krondor. The player navigates a party of three characters through the 3D world - this time with an optional full screen view. Enemy encounters occur at set positions on the overworld or within the few dungeons. An encounter triggers a separate battle screen, on which player-controlled party and the enemies engage in tactical turn-based combat. It is possible to sneak on enemies for a surprise attack if the character's corresponding skill is high enough. Unlike the predecessor, most towns can be physically explored, though a few are still displayed as a map with icons representing locations. Indoor environments and characters, however, are presented as hand-drawn images.\n\nLike in Betrayal at Krondor, characters join and leave the party as dictated by the plot. Aren is the only character who can cast spells, while others act like fighters or rangers. Magic elements can be researched and mixed to create spells, and include a wide array of protective and offensive magic. The skill system is very similar to that of the previous game: skills are improved by repeatedly using them and marking them in the skill menu for faster learning. Elements like a day and night cycle, weapon and armor repairing, navigation on world map, the necessity to eat and sleep regularly, etc. are also brought over from the earlier Dynamix game. Although the game is somewhat more linear, there is still a large amount of side quests taken from NPCs populating the game's many towns.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1997-07-31T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"142966":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Humongous Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ef114fd6-1e6c-4354-9eee-c8db3aec4bbc.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"142d9869-cb62-44f5-aa56-fdbaebc9ed8a.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"80ef1bb8-bb55-4827-909f-902a55e93d27.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0cbe9d2a-d6c5-4ec6-96a0-191d0b621388.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b30be49d-b04e-4e1e-8ba2-76a13a0825cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"9aef2357-91f1-4237-a7be-3732ae58c354.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"efb94132-535b-4115-8529-df2c89861204.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Backyard Baseball","Overview":"In this first installment in the Backyard Sports series, the player's goal is to assemble a team of backyard kids and take them all the way to the championship - in this instance, the Ultra Grand Championship of the Universe.

The two end up in different parts of a land known as Eldritch, with Rosella being transformed into a troll. They must find each other and eventually defeat an evil sorceress who plots to ruin the land.\n\nLike its predecessors, King's Quest VII is an adventure game primarily based on solving inventory puzzles.

Of the many skills a child acquires during his or her development, perhaps the most valuable to lifelong pleasure and further learning is the ability to read.","Publisher":"Discis Knowledge Research Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"149244":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"After Dark 3"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Berkeley Systems","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"673d8ee2-b3db-410e-bbf5-e9b342b7675f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d88aed2e-a8d9-46e6-bd0e-89b84e5bf8bf.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cbe28069-6ae2-409e-a8ac-f2c156c8dabf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7a160368-6243-4987-b7a7-f3004fc04fb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":3,"Name":"After Dark","Overview":"After Dark was a series of computer screensaver software introduced in 1989 by Berkeley Systems for the Apple Macintosh, and for Microsoft Windows in 1991.\n\nFollowing the original, new editions were introduced including More After Dark and Before Dark, as well as editions themed around licensed properties such as Star Trek, The Simpsons, Looney Tunes and Walt Disney Company characters.[2] The screensaver modules were often noted for their intertextuality, such as the flying toasters appearing in the Fish screensaver, and the cat from Boris screensaver appearing in the Bad Dog screensaver.\n\nAs well as the included animated screensavers, it allowed the development and use of third-party modules, of which many hundreds were created by the height of After Dark's popularity","Publisher":"Berkeley Systems","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"149246":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rainbow America","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"edc42ddf-981b-40b5-88b4-9e337e96d91e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"04a921c1-af08-4d28-96ee-9164e307f281.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c87b1ffc-5736-48eb-bc52-38081011fdc7.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"818066b9-a3e5-4404-a4bd-0379a7a0e1ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8a9402bd-5448-4ef0-a418-f7ddeaab2b35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Air Havoc Controller","Overview":"Essentially an airport traffic control tower simulator.

The games are all controlled with the mouse, and all have the same theme of aliens and outer space. The graphics are colorful and cartoony, and the arcade action is designed to be non-violent and kid-friendly. Each game has its own highscore table.\n\nCtrl-P is used to pause a game, Ctrl-A to stop playing the current game and choose another one to play, and Ctrl-Q to quit Alien Arcade altogether. The games run at 640x480 pixel resolution, but only a 512x342 pixel region of the screen is used for the games. Outside this is a static border featuring background art (such as the surface of a planet, or the inside of a spaceship) which changes randomly each time you play.\n\nThere are six games in the collection.\nAndromedroids: in this game you build up robots one piece at a time, by dropping them into one of seven assembly bins. There is also a recycle bin for dropping unused parts, and a special bug bin for dropping Mercurian Metal Bugs that may appear. Dropping the bugs in any other bin will cause damage to your robot parts.\n\nFungus Patrol: you control a ship in the middle of the screen that can only rotate, but if you click the mouse, the ship shoots out in a straight line on a bungee cord, touches the edge of the screen, then snaps back to the center. Green fungus encroaches in on you from the edges of the screen, and you clear it up by hitting it with your ship, which has a big suction nozzle on the front of it. The fungus can damage your bungee cord, and if it is completely eaten away, the game is over.\n\nNerdoids: you control a ship at the bottom of the screen that can only move left and right, and shoots comic books. Moving across the screen, on multiple levels, are orange aliens wearing glasses. If you hit an alien with a comic book, they will start reading it. If you hit an alien already reading a comic book with another comic book, they drop the one they are holding. The aim is to have all aliens still be reading a comic book when they leave the screen. The aliens will also randomly drop calculators and pocket protectors, that can subtract 5 comic books from your arsenal if they hit you.\n\nQuasar Klutzes: you control a ship at the bottom of the screen that can only move left and right, and shoots bananas. There are blue aliens walking back and forth on multiple levels. The aliens are clumsy and will either slip on bananas, or two aliens may collide trying to grab the same banana. They will then start falling towards the bottom of the screen, but if they hit your ship while falling you lose 5 bananas. Your goal is to cause all the aliens to fall. There is also a robot dog that sometimes appears, and drops clouds of gas that subtract 2 bananas from your ship if they hit you.\n\nQuasar Rain: this game takes place \"underneath\" Quasar Klutzes. Blue aliens and banana peels are raining down from the top of the screen, and you control a spring-loaded platform that slides left and right at the bottom of the screen. When an alien hits you, they are flung over to a wall of bunk beds on the left side of the screen. The aim is to avoid letting 3 aliens fall off the bottom of the screen (although the instructions assure us that the fallen aliens will be caught by a safety net, just off-screen) and also to avoid the banana peels, as they lose you points.\n\nStink Snakes of Saturn: you control a ship on the left edge of the screen that can only move up and down, and shoots pies. Yellow snakes appear from the right and slither towards you. If you hit a snake with a pie, it turns into a smiley face, that you can collect for a point bonus. You have a limited number of pies. If a pie misses, it will bounce back towards you, and you can collect it again. However, if a snake gets past you to the left edge of the screen, you lose 5 pies. When you have no pies left, it is game over.","Publisher":"Luxenberg Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"150237":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Robert Epps","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"58f417e0-83f1-41b3-ad47-ba8344b8df41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8b6699ca-db84-4039-a98e-0860c51bd3c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alien Force","Overview":"Alien Force places you in control of a space ship on a mission to destroy all enemy ships.

This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.\n\nThe most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for less amount of turns used) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.\n\nEvery turn the player plans the actions of his units and tries to defeat his enemy. The complexity of the game mostly comes from the many different units and weapons - everything has their use and weaknesses. It is vital to use the resources in the correct order and combination. There are also other factors to think about, e.g. fuel. Allied General tries to be player friendly by giving feedback during turns, e.g. by showing the probable combat result before the player issues the attack. He can also undo a turn as long as no new enemy units are scouted. Other extras are historical film material and optional combat animations.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"150242":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Gigglebone Gang: AlphaBonk Farm","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Headbone Interactive","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"9b9862f2-90b4-468a-8eb0-ad2a029ae230.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"368a3b33-3135-4dcb-bb02-8f01fa6f59bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"22e19889-00db-4ae8-84c0-44d333938545.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"AlphaBonk Farm","Overview":"This is a rare children's game that features some segments involving exploration in a storybook style similar to \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\" It's the first in the GiggleBone Gang CD-ROM series and provides more than 35 hours of playtime for children ages four and up.

One clown gets up on stage and holds a banner of an ending letter. The task is to scan through the other clowns and find the one who is holding a picture whose word ends with the same letter seen on stage.

The first teaches children about the stares of the USA, where they are and what their names are. The second teaches children about other countries in the world and where they are located.\n\nThe 'Geography Puzzle Game' is the game that teaches the US states. It has two modes of play, easy and hard. Both modes of play break the states of mainland USA (i.e. not including Alaska & Hawaii) into four zones. The player selects a zone and is presented with a sliding tile type of puzzle in which the tiles are in the shape of the states in the selected zone. In the easy mode all the player has to do is place the tile into its correct position and the game will display and speak the state's name. When all states have been positioned correctly Snoopy walks on screen waving the US flag and music plays. In the hard mode the player again places the state in its correct position, upon which the game displays a list of all the states in the zone, so that the player can choose the correct name for the state that has just been placed. \n\nThe Great Country Shoot game takes place in a circus in front of a globe and is a 1 or 2 player game. The player is asked to help one of the Snoopy characters find a country. The player jumps into a cannon, the globe spins, the player clicks on a region with their mouse and the character is fired from the cannon to parachute down to the selected location. If the player has selected the correct location the player gets a message of congratulation and is shown the character standing in the designated country.\n\nThe gameplay changes depending upon the level that has been achieved by the player(s). In level 1 when the player is asked to locate a country the correct region of globe flashes red\/green before the globe spins so that all the player must do is click on that region as it comes into view. In level 2 the player proceeds as in level 1 but when the region has been selected correctly the player must then select the correct country from the regional map. Level 3 is the same as level 2 but with a wider range of countries. Levels 4 to 7 have progressively more obscure countries to find and give no hints as to which region of the globe they are in. There are ten questions per level and at the end of the level the player is given their score.","Publisher":"Image Smith","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"150669":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d9436ec0-0f45-48b1-9dfd-47397ce099d3.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3f236d6d-daee-4177-8386-590454a90130.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"936ecf0c-f723-4b2e-85f1-58de10d6eb25.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c6d5dc3d-6ef3-427b-bd2b-d5be75bab750.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"85e14420-a50d-4fa0-a596-e78d279feefa.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hoyle Solitaire","Overview":"Hoyle Solitaire is the Windows version of the MS-DOS Hoyle Official Book of Games: Volume 2 with the 28 solitaire games found in that old release, upgraded with new looks, sounds and mouse control.

The main objective is to reassemble the picture by sticking the objects in their corresponding areas. Once the image is back to its original form, the player can click on some of its elements to explore them. For example, after completing the park, clicking on the circus within it will trigger a new such puzzle. Clicking on a particular object in the final exploration puzzle will reveal a separate animation featuring it and its name. This way, the kids can learn new words and associate them.\n\nPuzzle Maker - A puzzle editor. Using the toolbox and a selection of premade objects, the user can create new puzzles or modify existing ones. Puzzle Maker will automatically import the last picture seen while playing any of the other puzzles. The picture can be cut in three different ways and after that you need to reassemble it as it's normally done in Jigsaw.\n\nConnect the Dots - Clicking the numbers or letters in their correct numerical or alphabetical order will trace the margin of an object. After connecting all the dots correctly, the game will show the full object, its name and an animation for it.\n\nMix and Match - It involves combining different body parts to obtain a funny-looking character.\n\nJigsaw - An ordinary jigsaw puzzle.\n\nIn every puzzle it's possible to modify the original image's colors and draw other stuff on it using the toolbox.

The learning adventure begins in a virtual plaza where the player\/student can choose from a number of destinations to visit. Among the destinations are sizable, cross-referenced databases of both paintings and painter biographies.\n\nThe main attraction of Artrageous! is the rich variety of activities present. The activities cover 5 categories of understanding and appreciating art: Color, light, perspective, composition, and the life of art. The color category includes a color mixing game in which you must use varying amounts of red, blue, and yellow components to build a hue\/saturation color wheel. Another activity demonstrates the effect of adjusting the brightness or contrast of a picture. These and other activities are supplemented with narrated explanations of color concepts.\n\nThe activities covering light include a sphere with lights placed around it -- click on one of the lights to understand the visual effects of different light sources. Also, a game that explains light demonstrates how outlines create shape. The player's goal is to match a number of outlines to their respective images within a mish-mash painting.\n\nOne of the perspective category games is to arrange a roomful of floating objects where they would fit more appropriately on the painting backdrop. Both the painting and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point line grid for help.\n\nThe composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings convey meaning.

Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s\/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. \n\nThe game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.\n\nBattles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his\/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow. The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace. If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again. If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon\/character combinations, and immune against some.","Publisher":"Synergy Interactive Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996},"151597":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Image Smith","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"c7793807-fc35-4028-96db-42a3b51317ad.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01075fa7-94c3-4889-bf92-09e6ca68ef21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d3b68792-a189-4e77-a72c-3631e878bd10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yearn2Learn: Peanuts","Overview":"Yearn2Learn: Peanuts is edutainment software for kids aged 3 to 10, hosted by Snoopy and the Peanuts gang.

It's a game of global domination, like Risk, except that there are no cards to award bonus armies. Each player represents an ideology – Populist, Militarist, Socialist or Realist. The world is divided into 139 nations, each of which supports one of the players' ideologies. When you conquer a nation that supports your ideology, they greet you as liberators and require only 1 army to hold them, whereas nations that support rival ideologies need additional armies to remain in order to prevent a revolution. Armies are awarded at the beginning of each turn based on the number of nations held, plus bonus armies for holding an entire continent. World Empire II adds an \"all nations conquered\" option, in addition to the \"all nations neutral\" starting position of the original. Populations and national capitals are now listed for each country. Starting with v1.5, the game became \"Deluxe\" because it adds a real world simulation mode to the registered version, in which population and development are taken into account. Version 1.5 also adds an option to have all sides start with 30 armies instead of 56, and to check the status of all countries on the continent. The shareware version can be played by one to four players, with up to two computer players (one in v1.0). The registered version can be played against up to seven computer opponents, and adds three new ideologies.","Publisher":"Viable Software Alternatives","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"151811":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gregory Braun","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"07cbdbbe-cc83-42ba-aabe-3b5fa5529638.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c9a5e0a6-9c52-4c58-8376-c496eb78d32f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BattleStar","Overview":"BattleStar is basically a Battleship-variant for one player.

Journey back to a story retold in the classic tradition of Charles Perrault and the Brother's Grimm. Carry on the tradition of the highly valued, original tales passed from generation to generation. The story is told in considerably greater depth than the Disney version of a few years back, primarily because there's so much text and (therefore) so many more details. It is this preponderance of text – whether you're reading while listening to narration in \"storybook mode\", or just listening to narration in \"movie\" mode – that is the disc's greatest strength and fatal weakness. The simple, mostly black-and-white drawings and the pathetic excuses for animation (a flag that moves back and forth between two positions, to simulate waving in a breeze, is by no means a \"movie\") are disposable fluff. This storybook is really about using the computer, very straightforwardly, to read the story aloud while letting kids follow along.

In the meantime, a peaceful race of human-like creatures, the boozooks, populated the Earth. After the humans ascended to the surface again, they started a bloody war against this race. The boozooks were mercilessly destroyed, their culture demolished, and in the end of the war they were enslaved by humans.\n\nThe vertical, economically self-sufficient city of Vlurxtrznbnaxl was erected, controlled by a corrupt leader known as BigWig, who oppressed population with heavy taxes and freedom restrictions. The genius Professor Azimuth, sympathetic to the cause of the boozooks, has discovered a mysterious object or entity known as the Schnibble, which apparently could bring peace and prosperity to the world. However, BigWig's henchmen kidnap the professor and even shoot a teddy bear that belongs to his little adopted half-boozook son Woodruff. Applying a device called Viblefrotzer to himself, Woodruff physically ages fifteen years, and feels strong enough to begin a search for his foster father and find a way to dethrone BigWig.\n\nWoodruff is an adventure game with a cartoon-like appearance and many tricky puzzles, similar in art style and design to the Gobliiins series by the same creators. Unlike Gobliiins, this is a full-fledged adventure where the player character can move around freely, explore the large city, and interact with many characters. The interaction with the environment is done with a simple point-and-click system, without separate verb commands. The majority of the puzzles are inventory based; beside items, Woodruff can also use various spells (such as, for example, levitation) as well as ancient boozook formulae, which he has to learn and collect in order to advance in the game.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"152220":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Spiderweb Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"55fb0a42-b4c9-43d8-afe9-2893142fdd75.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"adb2132a-73ed-41c7-b0e3-dae34b312b7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9663b97c-20e2-429a-9c03-8fdb8a2bdc90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Blades of Exile","Overview":"This is the final game in the Exile series.

Die total verrückte Rallye) is a strategy game for up to eight players with similarities to board games like Monopoly. \n\nThe players join a rally through Europe and North Africa which consists of several stages. At the beginning of each stage a TV moderator names the capital of a country. The one who gets there first will win a lot of money. At first there are only Western European countries available but eventually the Berlin Wall falls and you can enter the former Eastern bloc.\n\nYou play on a map of Europe consisting of many fields merged with each other through lines. Before every turn a player dices and then he can move his figure over the fields. You can freely decide the route to your target but you have to notice on which field you would end your turn. There are:\n\n- Red fields: When you end your turn on a red field, you'll lose money.\n\n- Blue fields: Money will be credited to your account.\n\n- Yellow fields: You get a playing card. You can use these cards before every turn to your own advantage (i.e. use five dices instead of one) or to your opponent's disadvantage (i.e. having him transferred to a corner of the map).\n\n- Purple fields: On a purple field you can buy or sell cards.\n\n- Gray fields: Gray fields are cities. In a city you can buy buildings and earn rent every turn. When you own every building in a city, you have a monopoly and earn more rent. Contrary to Monopoly you don't have to pay anything when you come to a city where one of the other players have buildings.\n\n- Black and white fields: These fields represent the capital of a country. Buying buildings there is much more expensive but you will earn more rent.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is Dr. Drago. Drago is played by the computer and appears after stage one and will follow the player who had the highest distance to the target of the previous stage. After every turn Drago will waste parts of your money, sell or buy buildings to terrible prices or destroy your cards. To get rid of him you can use a Drago playing card (if you own one and Drago has not ripped it to pieces yet) or overtake one of the players. When you pass them, Drago will leave you and chase your opponent. \n\nThe winner of the game is the one who has the most money on his account after all stages. You could even win without winning a single stage but it's more difficult because you won't make that much profit with trying to end your turns on blue fields. And of course, Drago will haunt you the whole time when you are cruising in Northern Africa while all the stages end somewhere else.","Publisher":"Blue Byte Software GmbH","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Die_total_verr%C3%BCckte_Rallye"},"152680":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pigworks","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"12262992-0007-42a0-9817-70fcd6cde894.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d08971c8-c216-40ed-98e3-a469c949e4ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"46cb720a-b9cd-4043-9804-6cbdac57a464.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Capitalist Pig","Overview":"Capitalist Pig is one of the most fun - and the most obscure - business simulations released in the early 1990s. In this innovative game that foreshadows Capitalism Plus years later, your job is to start a company from scratch and build it to a conglomerate.\nThe game is more focused on the operational level of running a business, similar to Free Enterpri$e, than the strategic level of Capitalism Plus. The first thing you need to do is fill an empty building space with various departments: administration, marketing, and so on. Then, hire employees, launch the products, and watch the cash roll in. Of course, like real life, things do not always go as planned, and there are many random events to keep things interesting. These events range from macroeconomic news and world events, to company-specific accidents like a break-in and fire (for which you can buy insurance). You will also face the risk of embezzlements by employees you thought were worthy, grueling tax audits, and even terrorist attacks. One of the nicest touches are the historically accurate world events from 1901 and 1991 that are built into the model. Colorful animation, crisp cartoony graphics, and realistic sound effects add to the fun. The mouse-driven interface is also a breeze to learn, and the difficulty is about right.

In twelve stories that pulsate and migrate across the screen, narrator Jim Petrillo considers the strange lives of great inventors of the nineteenth century: Alessandro Volta, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Samuel Morse, and Nicola Tesla. But don't expect a dry treatise on the history of science. Petrillo's idiosyncratic perspective takes in the history of Sicily; Shelley and Byron's shenanigans during the summer of 1816 (Byron's daughter, Ada, wrote the first computer program); Joyce's X-rated love letters to Nora (the program takes its name from a movie theater opened by Joyce in Trieste in 1909); the cave paintings of Lascaux; Frankenstein; naked people; vampires; big noise; and the artist's own childhood memories. Often ironic (electricity was first used, he notes, to make dead frogs twitch), Petrillo's commentary weaves together an arresting collage of images and text. The subtitle promises \"Weird Science and Childhood Memories.\" Weird it is, and not for everyone.

It represented a new level of maturity for a century-old art form; namely comix, which to that point had mostly been a medium for superhero fantasies and funny animal stories. With the appearance of MAUS, the point was made simply and clearly that a comixture of words and pictures could be used to portray any subject matter 0 even one so fare removed from the traditional comix subject matter as the genocide and persecution of Polish and German Jews during the years surrounding the Second World War. The Complete MAUS CD-ROM grants the user unprecedented access to the historical and structural details behind the finished book. The pages of MAUS are linked to preliminary sketches, alternate drafts, archival photographs, and drawings made by prisoners and audio from the interviews between Art Spiegelman and his father that were the basis for the narrative.

If the opponent doesn't reach 61 this is considered a Double Skunk and is quadruple(four times the money).

They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!\n\nFortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him. Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid. Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him. Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map. In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited. Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.\n\nOther features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the \"drop\" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision. Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death. (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however).\n\nSome versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon. Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"153290":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Houghton Mifflin Interactive Corporation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"4b1cb542-732b-4f63-8fec-d0be7669c99c.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f8a3230-ab69-4b27-b64f-f94c5f346511.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ca11c79-54c0-42fd-99dc-c1480adb0620.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b7a06b40-60e2-4329-86eb-a5b1e6986252.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Day The World Broke","Overview":"The world is spinning out of control.

The navigation is impeded by islands that must be hopped over, volcanoes that spit hot lava, powerful currents, deadly spikes, and dangerous predators such as octopi and giant eels. The sonar ability has multiple functions: you can communicate with friendly animals, map out the nearby area (echolocation), activate glyphs, and eventually defeat enemies. Activating glyphs is necessary because they can unlock unexplored parts of the current level, including the exit that leads to the next area; some of them can even bestow the gift of invincibility on Ecco for a limited time.\n\nYou must keep an eye on the life and breath meters. Dolphins can't stay underwater for a long period of time and must return to the surface for air. However, the cavern systems may hide the occasional pocket of air as well. Every time you are hit by spikes, lava, or an enemy, Ecco loses health, and once it reaches zero you will have to replay the level from the beginning. The life meter can be replenished by eating fish or by finding healing clams, called the Shelled Ones, and communicating with them. It's possible to avoid most enemies, but Ecco can kill troublesome creatures using the death sonar or by charging them head-on.","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"153542":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Headbone Interactive","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"3d29fcde-4654-41c7-a6cd-ee72f9b7ad61.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cb1ad1cc-5aac-406f-97f1-e130b8aa8395.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c629bfc2-edd8-4584-9d7a-716f440e637a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d9464eef-2e3a-4470-8bfa-3cfa21bd4204.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c01aed88-7455-4349-bab8-5a96113066a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Elroy Goes Bugzerk","Overview":"Elroy loves bugs and has entered the 10th Annual Insectathon.

This time, footprints of bear, moose and rabbit are used as measure units.\n* Prop Sorter. The sorting machine needs a bit of help in gathering all the animals that fit Babs' description. The player can click on the bottom buttons to operate the platforms and throw the animals sitting on them all the way to the top stands.\n\nAfter completing all the activities, the player can view the performance at the local theater.

To succeed you'll need to pass through 5 levels of BOT soldiers shooting them at will, including a larger BOT boss at the end of every level. Try to pick up extra grenades, armor protection, and more powerful weaponry along the way to assist you in accomplishing this task. Finding the experimental lightning gun is especially helpful, since it inflicts twice as much damage on enemies as your normal gun.\n\nBUBBLE TROUBLE\nYou control a spaceship which you must use to clear the starlanes of subspace vortices (which look like terrestrial water bubbles). You must avoid contact with these vortices and shots by your own weapons, or your energy will slowly drain away. Your ship is armed with two weapons: guns, which are weak but use up little energy; and penetrators, which are strong but use up much more energy. Ship energy is used for thrusting, subspace jumping, and conducting repairs. Shields are used for defense only, and you lose shield power when you come in contact with vortices, bullets, penetrators, saucers, or stationary energy barbs.\n\nFLAK ATTACK\nA horde of robot commandos are attacking your base from the skies above. You control a single gun which you must aim and fire to stop the invaders, but don't run out of ammunition, or your base will certainly be destroyed. When a robot parachutes to the ground, it will walk towards your base and stand beside it. When 4 robots gather on one side of the base, they will destroy it, and the game will be over. The enemy ships include satellites, jets, and helicopters. Satellites fly past at high speeds, but they cannot harm your base directly. Jets fly overhead quickly, and the pilot will eject if you fire enough shots at it. Helicopters drop parachuting robots as they pass. Friendly UN Helicopters will drop extra ammo on your base if you let them fly peacefully overhead. \n\nMOLE'S QUEST\nAs Monty the Mole, you must rescue your belongings which the miners have scattered throughout the mines after they destroyed your beautiful home. Jump from platform to platform from the left to the right, grab the belonging, and jump back to the left to safely pass each level. Each time you save ten belongings, you will see an animation of Monty taking the rescued belongings to his new home. Since the mines are covered with radioactive ooze, you must limit your exposure to no more than 5 minutes at a time. That should be sufficient time to rescue each of your belongings. Every time you save a belonging, you will be given a password, so you can continue from the level where you stopped, even if you shut off your computer.","Publisher":"Mallard Software Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"154200":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chestnut New Media","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d04f2883-9336-4099-bccc-d6060888b832.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9dfc7a9c-8c4d-4b15-9fb1-16b649738960.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5618312-0745-4942-a17b-558f0a30fe85.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"eb81c066-016a-4d76-9ba3-db81596dc2e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"19bc63b7-66aa-4481-a2f3-402caef860d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Fate of the Starlords","Overview":"Action, adventure, and thrills will transport you to another world as The Starlords invade your reality.

These are cartoons that show the full extent of how the program functions with a finished product. One is semi-finished, as it is used by the manual as a tutorial to instruct the user on the use of the program. Once the mini-toons are viewed, the only thing left is to create your own cartoon. To accomplish this, many, many tools are given, along with quite a few scenery areas and props. Picture it as a movie studio, ala Roger Rabbit's Toon Town, on CD and you are the writer, director, producer and script writer. One is only limited by the imagination of the user.

Players take the roles of aliens deadlocked on a planet surface. The game has seven different races with special abilities, for example the Maugs are great scientists, ChCh-T have the highest birth rate etc. They spend turns building, expanding, and ultimately warring. The planet's surface is divided into smaller areas. Each area is home to one of the cities that need to be constructed. To colonize a new area, the player must build a colonizer. Players can expand their cities by erecting residential buildings, farms, factories, mines and research centres. Inventions made in the latter provide new units, new materials and better buildings (for example a hydroponic farm is far better than a normal farm). The residents' satisfaction is important - dissatisfied citizens (taxes are too high) protest and don't work.\n\nThe battle begins after the player places their units in a foreign land. Battles are separately animated - after being initiated players have no control over them. The game also has a spying mechanic that spies can use to steal technologies. The player wins by fulfilling one of the victory conditions, for example remaining the last living race on the planet, or reaching a set number of city centres first.","Publisher":"Accolade, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996},"154240":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Human Code, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"e139996b-1f23-4183-bd50-b972989a98bd.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6a16a905-86d2-46b1-b5ec-790516391ec0.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef2cc1b4-3257-4e1c-836e-ca964c0d2524.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8afe73e1-9f02-4f52-87e7-586e9bf70b4d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a1095a8a-eb55-47ad-8d9e-7f377da45929.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wishbone and the Amazing Odyssey","Overview":"Wishbone And The Amazing Odyssey is a lesson about Homer's «Odyssey» in which Wishbone (a Jack Russell terrier from a PBS educational television show) plays the role of Odysseus.

The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.\n\nBuilding on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.\n\nWhile flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.\n\nWhile playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.","Publisher":"Paramount Interactive","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"154754":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Powerhouse Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"338a33e5-5e5f-4794-9040-6f87e0f9474d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f3f55be1-e059-41fe-affb-a43a4552ec4a.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1913e051-5b47-4e45-afa8-41750c4be77c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"037a3d02-2d39-45d3-88bd-c15f4e5fb5c7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"18b02a23-ccd2-4745-abc1-216d6a4923d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"de9b1484-204c-43c9-be9d-6be42e0c1be6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jungle Book","Overview":"Deep within India's Black Jungle, a scandalous crime has taken place.

However, in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny, he was outgunned and had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Coarsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.\n\nFreddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click adventure game bearing many similarities to other Sierra titles in the same genre, in particular Leisure Suit Larry series. Players use the command bar at the top of the screen to choose a verb command that is combined with locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up. Like other Sierra games, successful actions add to the player's score, judging the player on 1000 points.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"154884":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Goodsol Development, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4da815d8-6f5b-4bbb-95ca-d66b25e9314d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6d81e69e-cc30-4fb5-acbb-57f1b46db6a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"FreeCell Plus","Overview":"FreeCell Plus 1.x contains the following solitaire games:\n* FreeCell\n* Sea Towers\n* Stalactites","Publisher":"Goodsol Development, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"154890":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Philippe Basciano","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"009cda98-fb95-438e-a35f-8547998c8612.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ae1b3bd8-d16e-4255-a420-b84d976fb240.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fructus","Overview":"First to say, Fructus based upon Columns.\n\nBefore you start the game, you can choose in the options your starting level, the higher the level, the faster the fruits will fall.

The player is presented with three tiles, two of which are empty and one of which has a gecko depicted on it. When the gecko is clicked, the three tiles are reversed and then re-arranged; the player then has to click on the tile which, in his opinion, is the one with the gecko. The tiles are then revealed again, and the player can see whether his guess was correct. A successful guess gives 10 points. The game can be played at one of the 10 levels - the higher the level, the faster the tiles move.\n\nThere are two game modes: the \"Single Level Shuffle\", where the player chooses the level he wishes to play on, and has an opportunity to make 20 guesses (correct or not) before the game ends; and the \"Progressive Level Shuffle\", which is based on the same rules, but the level increases with each successful guess and decreases with each failure.\n\nAfter each guess, the player can see an instant replay of the tiles re-arranging, but in slow motion and with the tiles revealed.","Publisher":"Public Domain\/Freeware","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"155103":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Educational Insights, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"4c30a351-c917-467b-b359-de135a42a423.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"578b002b-65e1-4e25-bcce-189f6b966416.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"164df0a2-73f0-4b04-82f8-39d46ee13ebe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"GeoSafari: Geography, History, & Science","Overview":"This multimedia learning game has 15 dazzling games that bring geography to life.

The galopetra (\"milk stone\") has a hieroglyphic and a maze carved on one side, and a Minotaur on the reverse. Intrigued, he travels to Crete and starts to explore the newly discovered Knossos ruins. Searching the labyrinth, he stumbles upon a time machine, dubbing it the \"Loony Machine\". He leaves instructions at the site on how the device works, for future explorers willing to travel to 2000 years in the past and assume the role of Theseus, the slayer of the Minotaur.\n\nLoony Labyrinth is the 4th pinball simulator created by LittleWing. It has one table with classic proto-Greek mythological themes. As an explorer and later as the legendary hero Theseus, the objective is to first find and activate the time machine, and then go back to ancient times and defeat the Minotaur.\n\nIn the first part, the goal is to collect all the five galopetra stones and install them to activate the machine. The ball has to hit drop targets near the stone ramp to make one of the STONE light letters start flashing. One stone is collected by sending the ball up the ramp while the light is blinking. Getting all the stones awards five million points. To install them, the ball has to hit several times the energy charger bumper, raising the energy level to 100% and turning on the install hole.\n\nAfter traveling to 2000 B.C., the music changes and a multiball starts to indicate the switch. The goal is to rescue nine human sacrifices and kill the Minotaur. The LOONY LABYRINTH lights at the center of the table turn on to show the number of hostages, turning off with every saved victim. Shooting the labyrinth ramp rescues them one at time. After everyone is safe, a multiball starts where the player must sink three balls in the Minotaur chamber before the moon phase indicators near the flippers turn off, to defeat the creature and win the game.","Publisher":"Starplay Productions, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"155139":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Berkshire Multimedia Group","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"6420df65-3d8d-46c1-b19e-2847809d98ea.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b2761663-1150-42f5-b0d4-62f1c0cce613.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5853091e-8e2f-435b-9c86-c918c0926e74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Louis Cat Orze: The Mystery of the Queen's Necklace","Overview":"necklace has been stolen, and you, the trusty investigator, have a short six days to track down the thief. The Royal Palace at Versailles is the scene of the crime. Aided by the mischievous Louis Cat Orze, a feline of royal descent if there ever was one, you must explore the palace and the surrounding countryside, listen in on conversations, and occasionally pick a pocket. Louis Cat Orze isn't a free ride, though-fees must be paid, palms greased, and while you begin the game with a certain amount of livres, you have to investigate thoroughly and learn about the era in order to earn more. Or you can try your hand at the Palace Games to increase (or decrease) your purse. Once you think you know the identity of the thief, you can present your accusation to the king - if you can afford to see him, and if you haven't been thrown into the Bastille! It has its share of pitfalls; some of these you learn by doing, and some are buried in the manual (read it completely). You'll need to listen carefully to understand what's going on, for what people say can lead you in different directions - some are plausible dead ends, but some will be of real value. Learning about the 17th century is the only way you'll win. The drawings are somewhat cartoonish and the animation is minimal. Secret passages, exchanges of money in the Orangerie, the clink of gold coins in the Grand Apartment and gossip in the Hall of Mirrors all play an important part in this riveting mystery. You only have six days to solve the mystery. The game includes 75 biographies of people who lived during this period.

Crisscross is a sort of crossword puzzle, but instead of clues you just need to figure out where the words go. Flash cards are flash cards… You hear or see a word and then spell it out. Word finder is a grid filled with letters wherein several words are hidden. \n\nOnce you finish the above you can enter a spelling bee where you face the Master of Mischief and\/or his robots. Winning opens up new levels of competition such as Regional or International.","Publisher":"The Learning Company","ReleaseYear":1999},"155196":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Learning Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"23deddf2-615f-4e0c-9dd2-9190ae877b24.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Solvers: Treasure Mountain!","Overview":"Treasure Mountain is an educational game designed for children ages 5-9. The Master of Mischief has stolen the magic crown as well as other treasures and hidden them on Treasure Mountain! Your goal is to locate the magic crown and as many of the treasures as possible while climbing your way to the top. To make your way up the mountain, you will need to find keys which unlock a path. The keys are hidden somewhere behind an object on each level of the mountain. To find out what is behind an object you need to use one of your magic coins. However, the number of coins you have is limited and there are many places to search so you first need to find clues as to where keys (and treasures!) are located. Wandering about the mountain are numerous elves; if you catch a scroll carrying elf in your net, he'll ask a question. A correct answer will provide a clue. After reaching the top of the multi-leveled mountain, all the treasures you collected along the way will be put back in the treasure chest, and you begin again at the bottom with a tougher difficulty level. After all treasures have been brought to the top, you can find the crown and win the game!","Publisher":"The Learning Company","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Treasure_Mountain!"},"155198":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Friendly Software Corporation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2314a20e-ea19-4236-ad00-624a88572d24.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2d684b39-0736-4a08-9553-872df437000e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e19c3842-fe5d-4f8f-8db1-b111758f3580.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6f9571c0-3c14-4b31-b8cd-ed2073d43e8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"da9392f8-6833-4264-b86b-c0a221c0b7f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Greg Norman Ultimate Challenge Golf","Overview":"Endorsed by pro golfer Greg Norman, this golf sim places you on the Medalist Golf Club stationed in Florida (which Norman himself helped to design), and Norman acts as your host in the course, giving fly-by narrations and insight on the course, as well as accompanying you on golfing rounds.\n\nGameplay is standard golf fare, with the addition of two modes: arcade and simulation.

The player with the higher face-up card wins all cards in the war. Next to the cards, each player has three tanks that shoot at each other as cards are drawn. When a player loses a war, a tank is also lost. When all tanks are lost the opponent wins.

The two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division.","Publisher":"Microsoft Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"155844":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rhode Island Soft Systems","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"ebc67492-df12-4499-b936-c3766cbc161b.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"70de2428-8242-4f01-af49-bc85cc30c212.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ee8611c-447d-4c9c-acff-b6360521949b.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"886798f3-6611-46d5-9fb7-e7cf4081fb12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf770855-a427-4acc-9727-b3e4ea54ed1a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Jixxa","Overview":"The world's first CD-ROM jigsaw puzzle game.

After the opening credits, you enter an elevator and walk down the corridors of a gray office building matching the set for the music video \"Jump They Say\". You are given a choice of entering three rooms: the David Bowie suite, the video suite or Room 2901. Inside the David Bowie suite is an office with desk, filing cabinet and chair. By clicking a camera sitting on the desk, you hear a 10-minute audio interview with shallow off-the-cuff commentary from Bowie, illustrated with photographs from a recording session. Clicking a briefcase on the floor launches an equally unsatisfying 10-minute video interview. Room 2901 contains a telescope. Looking through the telescope, you enter rooms in a hotel across the street to watch four music videos: \"Jump They Say,\" \"Black Tie, White Noise,\" \"Miracle Goodnight\" and \"You've Been Around.\" The videos play in a window filling an eighth of the screen and look almost as good as MTV. Inexplicably, the hotel rooms contain little hidden surprises that seem to have wandered onto the disk from some children's game - click on a dog, for example, and it barks; click on a bowling trophy, and a bowling ball rolls across the floor. The video suite puts you at the controls of a video-editing machine where you create a customized version of \"Jump They Say.\" The creativity is strictly limited, however, to selecting from five video tracks playing simultaneously, designating one to display on the main screen.","Publisher":"BMG Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"156007":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Life Simulation; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"76ddb73b-fb07-4d18-869d-997e856f7ca2.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c7927cae-e093-45f1-848f-ca102b7d0970.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9924214-bc11-4b44-aaa5-98e232acdcaf.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"768e5740-3a00-4275-9ce4-ffe295bccdcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"89b0eec9-8a43-4292-9af8-b6309f168d06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Jones in the Fast Lane: CD-ROM","Overview":"Functionally identical to the original Jones in the Fast Lane, but delivered on a CDROM and containing the following enhancements:\n\nWindows 3.1 version: Redbook CD Audio for the voice acting; additional animation and actor portraits; with the addition of a native Windows executable and MIDI music.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"156290":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Funnybone Interactive","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"e8da9b05-3ddf-4df8-94ba-f4f5f982f738.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7b73a65f-750b-4beb-ac26-f014acf249fd.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Lie","Overview":"The Lie is an entry in the Puddle Books series.

When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.\n\nThis CD version had full speech throughout the game.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"156465":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"bce5b4dc-e954-4452-883e-e7d3b5ea558b.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0dd6ee1d-f804-4041-9760-9b682545f544.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6187f367-5b4a-467c-8827-5b4858f9985c.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3b826a7d-1b83-4fcd-b970-28c19ef73483.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"536eb6e6-93a9-4a9a-bbd9-99f515d7d0e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow","Overview":"For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.\n\nLike its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs (\"walk\", \"examine\", \"use\", \"talk\", etc.). \n\nThe CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a pre-rendered introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"156989":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"BVM Produktion GmbH","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"1b1ae52e-a5d3-47dc-9af0-a9f1b71cba3d.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b7c7729-352e-48d2-a087-08f18b46e385.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Oscar the Balloonist and the Secrets of the Forest","Overview":"Carmela, Oscar the balloonist's treasure chest, has gone missing.

There is a considerable degree of freedom in the interaction, allowing the player to perform actions not connected to the main story, some of which will, however, lead to the protagonist's death.

It is set in Southern France in the year 1208. Summoned to his father's side, the protagonist Simon Lancroix is told that he must obtain a valuable manuscript in a secret room and deliver it only to Petrus, a friend who lives in Toulouse. His pleading hints that this mission might be dangerous, but Simon agrees even though he doesn't understand. Shortly thereafter, his father dies. The interaction begins in the library as you start Simon's adventure.\n\nThis is a first person, point and click game with a somewhat unconventional interface. The inventory contains objects which can be used as well as clicked on during conversations. Icons of the people Simon has met or heard about also act as conversation topics when clicked on. The game features an in-game hint system which provides very vague clues to the many puzzles Simon will encounter. A comprehensive encyclopedia is accessible at any time to document and elaborate upon the historical facts of the era and to the game itself. \n\nAngels, demons and people from all walks of life will help (or hinder) Simon's progress towards his goals as he travels around France's towns and countryside. Locations are varied with marketplaces, villages, a ruined fortress, gothic churches and, later, fanciful environments. Puzzles include several mechanical problems, helping other characters with objects and information as well as creative environment manipulation.","Publisher":"Infogrames Multimedia SA","ReleaseDate":"1998-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"164457":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Spidersoft Limited","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3a1420ce-985a-495d-bbad-a8a63eb22280.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a69d5ef-0090-47d0-8195-f6a0bb0ca5be.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"40b9259f-50cc-4368-aa70-97ea18813137.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ecb6e5fb-8916-4b3d-914b-dff7f89c0d8e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7c514a3b-604b-4542-bff7-240cb645973b.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0fa7c6cd-1b15-4a61-9c4a-d990ae6e3f09.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2473fa8-e454-4b74-8b6f-8c867a2d2f4f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"63936755-177f-4170-ac19-aab090b8e846.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0ccb18da-0bb5-4428-a733-5cf6bc424901.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pinball Builder: A Construction Kit for Windows","Overview":"From the creators of the Pinball Dreams\/Fantasies series comes a pinball construction kit for Windows.

It plays animations and videos of hurricanes and other weather phenomena. It also contains clues to the solution of some of the puzzles. In an effort to further dispel any attempt at any meaningful amount of challenge, a hint button is provided on the interface at the bottom, placed between the inventory and the volume control and a compass.\n\nGameplay is the standard fare of this type of game: instead of Myst's focus on mechanical puzzles, most are inventory-based.

Imagine a unique story told in an unprecedented way. Developed by Xiphias, the company that introduced the first computer graphics system to be used in television news (KNXT in Los Angeles), Soft Kill is a unique techno-thriller based on the latest in hi-tech that explores the possibility of a world power using non-lethal warfare to bring the U.S. to its knees. Two politically opposed characters are thrown together in defense of the United States as a rogue element of the Japanese military attacks the Alaska Pipeline, the Panama Canal and the Malaccan Straits. The action explodes from a secret U.S. Navy base on Kauai to an ancient military shrine in Tokyo, from the North Shore of Alaska to the Palaces of Riayadh and the deep bowels of the United State's computer systems. Founded in a deep understanding of the vulnerability of the American infrastructure to attack and disruption, and the age-old attempts of governments to contest each other's territories of influence, this story combines high drama with photo-realistic imagery and video of secret places. The disk contains more than 70 digitized images and more than an hour of narration, which tell the story of what \"nonlethal warfare\" will be like in the not-so-distant future. Soft Kill owners can have the story told from different perspectives, including those of a narrator and the story's main characters. The innovative gameplay system consists of seven rows of ten cells each (called the Matrix), with four storytelling modes possible: Author (basic storytelling), Point-of-View (first-person views of varying subjects or subplots), Random (play sequences within each cell), and User (create your own path through the cells).","Publisher":"Compton's New Media","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"165872":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fringe Multimedia","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"facb5f83-314b-495f-853f-61cb83973102.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8b224983-2f44-4b05-bf54-9d436b8c624d.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c05564ae-6c39-4de9-b8e4-91ff4ded4907.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dbb0cf74-c13b-437b-923d-a9d7077c18d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SkyBorg: Into the Vortex","Overview":"This graphics adventure game from Skybox (the well-known trading card company), came with three packs (18 cards total) of Skyborg trading cards.

The game is set in an alternate world where it is normal to see zombies and monsters roam the streets. They are kept under control by MEI (Mortality Enforcement, Inc.) - an organization that \"helps the dead stay dead\". As the monsters grow in number however, they organize themselves and demand civil rights. Since they are a common sight and fairly harmless, people do not worry about them, but a mysterious substance known as Goop changes the monsters' character drastically.\n\nMEI brings in the freelancers Mortis \"The Skullcracker\" Rigor and Penelope \"Bonebreaker\" Jones to bring back order. Players can choose between one of the two characters, each with a distinct fighting style. With side-scrolling brawling gameplay, they need to travel through four main locations of four levels each. Some of the places visited are a shopping mall, an arcade, the graveyard, a playground, the MEI headquarters, and more. Next to moving, jumping, and climbing, they can punch and kick opponents, and use power-ups such as flare guns, flame throwers or supersoakers filled with holy water to take out enemies, while replenishing health with pick-ups.","Publisher":"GTE Entertainment","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996},"165875":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maxis Software Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"c247534c-ee0d-4016-a795-0f2db0648ed3.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3095d850-bb0d-4a0b-8d7e-c2b65d8f75a0.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f2bbaef-d4df-4223-a633-58edbf2b03da.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1616f32c-a3cf-41d9-bfd6-8badcf09b9a1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e51cf5f1-e0bc-4299-a786-8aa6789ee407.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SimTunes","Overview":"SimTunes is based on \"Music Insects\", an interactive audio-visual exhibit which was designed and created by Toshio Iwai in 1992.

Through such precision control of molecules, Maxwell's Demon would be able to reverse entropy and, among other things, create wonderful perpetual motion machines. But could such a demon work?\n\nFor nearly a century, scientists argued about whether Maxwell's Demon could really defeat entropy. Finally, Maxwell's Demon was undone by the argument of French physicist, Leon Brillouin, in the 1950s. The argument? Simply that Maxwell's Demon would have to work too hard. Maxwell's Demon was put to rest.\n\nBut wait! He's back! Only he's not a demon anymore. Now he's a maniac! And he's trying harder than ever to keep those molecules flowing in the right direction.

Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes.

As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.\n\nStriking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing.\n\nThe courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations.

The player takes the role of Frank Carlson, a disgraced British secret service agent. His career having ended after he failed in a mission on board the HMS Titanic, he now lives in a small apartment, surrounded by mementos of his past. Somehow, however, Carlson is thrown backward into his past to April of 1912, giving the player an opportunity to change the events on board the doomed ship. While the player is not able to avert the sinking of the Titanic, they are able to influence not only Frank's timeline but that of the other passengers on board the ship and, indeed, the progression of subsequent human history. As a result, details of the game's plot are affected by the player's actions, which can result in one of any number of significant or minutely different endings.\n\nThe game is a puzzle-solving adventure game which utilizes a simple, point-and-click system in order for the player to interact with the world. While the game is played in the form of a traditional adventure game, it expands on this established system by constructing its game play around the idea of a continuous, transitory world. While the player still progresses through the game primarily through solving puzzles and interacting with other characters it presents these interactions as taking place within an active, malleable world. Characters, for instance, periodically move about the ship, and can be found in different portions of the ship during different times of day as they pursue their lives apart from the player.\n\nPuzzles are similarly tied to this progression of time, and players may choose to pursue plot lines how ever they think is best, influencing both the plot and other puzzles within the game, allowing them to completely overlook or pass over entire puzzles and story points. Early in the game, for instance, the player is asked to locate an item hidden by another character. If they're able to discover its location early enough, they can take the item from its hiding spot before someone else does. If they're sidetracked by other characters within the world, or in some other way too slow in locating the object, the hiding spot will be empty and the plot will accommodate this development. It is important to note, however, that the game does not progress in real-time as other adventures, such as The Last Express, do. Rather, time progresses due to the player solving a puzzle or in some other way advancing the game.\n\nIn addition to the traditional puzzles within the game, there are also mini-games which the player can participate in either for fun or to influence the plot, such as poker and fencing.","Publisher":"GTE Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Titanic:_Adventure_Out_of_Time"},"179377":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dynamix, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"34f2beb2-2f1d-4098-83fd-a7bbb42858d9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"47eaed84-0478-425f-b8b3-a5c693ec6720.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"de2fd008-7f09-4d47-b6b3-b9256909d4f7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"359a288a-fd5b-4cd6-b154-9830cf5f7a5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3b41e797-a93c-4c24-b2d2-042c70dc7d1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"84b0f497-5c30-47d9-ba4b-7e000d11defb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Trophy Bass","Overview":"Trophy Bass is a fishing simulation.

Your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. However, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. With each eaten mouse, Paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. You must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. Another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. Keep in mind that Paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. The same happens when Paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. This means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game.\n\nYou are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. The faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. When Paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. If you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five.\n\nThe python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. For clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. It is also possible to freely choose a level. Furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. The registered version of this shareware game features the ScreenSculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.","Publisher":"Public Domain\/Freeware","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":1993},"197934":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microsoft","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a63b6b54-f37d-4337-b04e-01f0ebe37b42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3ddf70f6-60e9-4bba-b0d7-c565021396f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rattler Race","Overview":"Very much a snake game, Rattler Race adds a few twists to the long-held conventions of the genre: in addition to a competing snake foiling your routes, a ball bounces around the play-field, Pong-style, killing your snake should the ball ricochet against its head.\n\nThis game is largely known on account of having been included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2 for Windows.","Publisher":"Microsoft","ReleaseYear":1991},"199183":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"4951de0f-1a6c-490d-9ca5-17c69a4b1ad6.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e1b2ffac-2bbe-4f98-b8c0-31f5941d978c.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"56dc6b77-c605-48cc-ba13-2d21ae7aa571.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"56475a5a-fbf0-4506-adcb-acd57923d9fa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e16ee644-2bcd-407b-9c72-3ad3bccba244.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"044ac82e-945d-449e-9bb3-0bff1936c4e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6610d7e1-05f2-49b6-aab0-158be0bb0b4d.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bbe303ec-428b-4c2c-88f1-49eee71ec2e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1a1147d5-d50a-4032-9df6-73efc8eb89c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sid Meier's Civilization II","Overview":"Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri. As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect. There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns. Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city. There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.","Publisher":"MicroProse Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-02-29T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iiDSfWeCr3Y","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Civilization_II"},"199534":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"United Pixtures","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"30892243-2cba-459e-bd0d-a1214f186359.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0ca67cdd-c30c-48c0-a1d8-640162ce4cee.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56647392-6c21-47f6-9964-b72cce6b63ea.png","Region":"South America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Plumbers Don't Wear Ties","Overview":"Plumbers Don't Wear Ties is an adult-oriented \"romantic comedy\" graphic adventure game\/dating, and interactive movie, sim developed by United Pixtures and published by Kirin Entertainment for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.

Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.\n\nGabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g. Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games.\n\nThe game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically, Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers"},"199569":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Oxford Softworks","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"7d3b12ff-2c90-4f4b-b8bb-68818935e314.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7222b1d7-715e-4716-8433-7194642f0ac8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a4b929d-b230-4d57-b33b-50d293e16711.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"83ac5250-9f8d-45fc-891a-5859544cd35f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"68dc6af3-b904-431a-aaff-350472e507d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"83802214-8cf3-4057-9e2f-931ab2d2a8b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"44ca65d7-f6af-42ad-b9c4-a88971c21afb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e37a2d1e-d355-4ccf-90de-34803cd9bc03.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"91c8116b-8e77-4f8a-b520-a417972da597.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mind Games Entertainment Pack for Windows","Overview":"Mind Games Entertainment Pack For Windows contains ten classic games for Windows, including Chess, Chinese Chess, Bridge, Backgammon, Reversi, 4 In A Line, Checkers, Go, Gomuku, and Renju.

It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.\n\nLike the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).\n\nCombat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quest_for_Glory:_Shadows_of_Darkness"},"199572":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"New World Computing","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"1a58312f-682f-4b42-bc70-e3ea983def4a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd7295ba-a3f1-4947-ba98-27d974c23852.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e643845c-11b2-4a97-ae0f-1209619db816.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"46bac78f-b4b7-411d-80c5-80195c8886b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"60fee8b4-0b26-4f32-b1b9-f1ec42d97862.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a52d609f-497b-4257-b482-9951b11bce7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Multimedia Celebrity Poker","Overview":"Heartfelt, but rather unrealistic wishes like ruling the world, unlimited processing power or an evening playing poker with three celebrities usually fall into the sphere of competence of a fairy. In case one happens to show up in your home: don’t ask for that poker game. That’s already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.\n\nIf you’re into TV series, then you’ll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan „Riker“ Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid „freezing“ of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.\n\nMultimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, it’s always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The program’s poker skill is mediocre; it’s playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.","Publisher":"New World Computing","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Multimedia_Celebrity_Poker"},"199573":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TSi, Inc.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"327cc61c-cbc7-41df-8812-cf952a8f529f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f1c9f765-07a0-428d-90f0-eb699e7ddc8c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed5bb2d8-cb06-4119-9612-9366c47859b5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b032105d-2d9f-4307-98f9-ba0654fae3b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8942f123-5427-417c-8cc4-8f12f58101d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cc688231-60f1-4f22-93e3-eb47f08460c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a458991e-7a8a-4292-8fa2-a7f447ca479c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Noir: A Shadowy Thriller","Overview":"Set in the 1940's L.A., you are a classic P.I. and your detective buddy Jack Slayton has gone missing.

Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.\n\nOut of This World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.\n\nTypically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.\n\nEach level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.","Publisher":"Interplay Productions","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Another_World_(video_game)"},"199576":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Time Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"5a176c84-488b-4dc1-ac4d-fa898ce38a92.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"13b5305b-2add-4532-ae99-23e22eb19dd6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a199c7e7-e429-4744-9d14-52b265821d33.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"da6a8827-ae24-46e1-9c6e-d2d74a7183bd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"daf94b8a-9805-4ee4-aff9-decb43a4cb4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"59e4cde9-cc24-4cfe-a292-ae008e245d27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Over the Reich","Overview":"Over the Reich is a turn-based strategy\/flight simulator hybrid.

You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.\n\nThe game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American Revolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading\/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your colonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.\n\nColonization is much like a more developed version of Sid Meier's previous game Civilization (1991) in visual design and handling, but the two have marked differences in gameplay. Instead of forging a nation from nothing, the player manages the cross-Atlantic expansion of an established one in the service of the Crown. As the colonies become more self-sufficient their subservience shifts from boon towards bane, and to win the player must ultimately declare independence and defeat the Royal Expeditionary Force in battle.","Publisher":"MicroProse Software","ReleaseDate":"1995-05-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sid_Meier%27s_Colonization"},"199583":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maxis Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Life Simulation; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"7ceb42e2-c910-4360-8ec7-0cf0a3b483bb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b4181821-ed39-4428-87c8-d2a56ea9f25c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"03393b5c-458d-4b05-be6a-c05931ba9326.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6c28aa1b-3b57-43ea-9192-494d31b445e6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6fddf502-1661-40bb-861d-ca9eb81449dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fb5f0b8d-5308-4078-a8c2-2e0df63233aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SimLife","Overview":"A complex game in which you can create your own ecosystems, animals or vegetables, then watch them eat, evolve, mate, or die.\n\nFeel free to create funky animals!
