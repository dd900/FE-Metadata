The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2012-06-12T00:00:00-07:00"},"12027":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihilistic Software","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2cb771fe-e805-459c-916a-0d7ba70fbc28.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f67b7e35-1f75-4cb0-85b5-c33aebf94e1f.jpg","Region":"Russia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4db30183-4638-43f0-b389-6f3626038480.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"531a16ff-b7a1-4c6c-ac89-a46e77cc70f9.jpg","Region":"Russia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"040ce725-c0df-49e7-9afc-ec4a27632f64.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"561a0c37-1afd-49f9-9284-6c9e760a7811.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"3ea29177-e0be-44cf-9046-4228354938f0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"817837f7-4fea-48f4-8f61-864d0cd56046.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"61d9a578-d77d-4518-a21a-701344074051.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ce427833-88fe-43ca-bdd3-df4e7aec2470.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Resistance: Burning Skies","Overview":"Resistance: Burning Skies is a unique Resistance experience developed specifically for PS Vita that takes full advantage of the system's dual analog sticks and features an all-new hero and story written by William C.

It was developed by Acquire, authors of the Tenchu and Way of the Samurai series, as a sequel to Shinobido: Way of the Ninja and Shinobido: Tales of the Ninja. A downloadable content pack, Mirror Spirits, was released on May 9, 2012.[citation needed] The game, along with its DLC, was removed from the PSN Store in 2016, most likely due to the license expiring from Bandai Namco in North America and the PAL region.\nPlayers take the role of one of the two main characters, Zen and Kaede. The main town features various menus. Some allow players to equip ninja tools such as caltrops, mines, shurikens, potions, smoke bombs, etc., while others let them accept missions from the three primary daimyou. As they progress through the story, players have the choice of which daimyou they want to help, and they are encouraged to only help that daimyou, encouraging three separate playthroughs. The daimyou issue various missions such as assassinating a certain target, protecting a shipping crate with supplies, freeing captive peasants, or stealing resources. Once a mission is selected, players are dropped into a map filled with enemies and treasures to collect. They must utilize stealth and a variety of skills such as a grapple hook, silent assassinations, counter attacks, etc., in order to complete their objective. Once they level up, they can put attribute points into max health, attack, defense, an extended special attack meter that allows for the Zankoku attack (a teleporting silent kill), and a longer grapple hook. Along the way, players will encounter various bosses, such as enemy ninja clan leaders, and eventually the other daimyou themselves. Players can utilize items to weaken their foes or try to lure them into a silent kill, allowing for a wide variety of play-styles.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-21T00:00:00-08:00"},"12446":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WayForward Technologies","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5e56d5d6-ea0a-48a2-b07b-09a1d1ea4aec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e5683b85-7d97-4020-b1f5-948c049e2787.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7747f9dd-97e0-4123-b615-04942c085d4f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"69ec002d-83e1-4877-bc49-42195441c64f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"a5a30760-ea2f-49c1-b433-089266ff6c32.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"84e960b2-ecfd-4b10-83bc-c22c6d62668f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Silent Hill: Book of Memories","Overview":"Book of Memories is an all-new game in the Silent Hill series, with a unique premise and storyline.

The game features 53 missions where you fight against aliens on city streets, in underground caves and on coastal zones. You have access to 170 weapons divided into 7 categories including assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, grenades and more.\n\nYou unlock new weapons throughout the game by picking up Weapon objects, dropped by killed enemies. Weapon objects provide you random weapons including those the character already has. On some maps there are also helicopters, battlemechs, tanks and bikes that can be controlled.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version features 2-player split-screen multiplayer where you can play cooperative or versus battle. The PS Vita version has an online cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players.\n\nEarth Defense Force 2017 is the first game in the series that features AI controlled EDF forces on its maps; in both previous games, the player fought completely by themselves, despite supposedly being in an army.

Each Faction card can be equipped with powerful Resource and valuable Fortune cards, which enhance their stats and give them special abilities.

By being successful at events (either normal races with 16 athletes, checkpoint races, elimination races, a head to head race with two drivers or freestyle\/trick events), the player earns money which can be invested into improving the driver's statistics (endurance, instinct, mobility and strength), equipment (e.g. energy drinks which give a speed boost), the next events, switching to a better team or unlocking the three other drivers. Each driver is a specialists for a certain events which results in more price money.\n\nThe other playing modes are single races, playing the Championship (either MX1, MX2 or custom) or participating in freestyle events in which the player needs to perform stunts in order to gain points. In the regular races, tricks only plays a small role because there is only one to perform: when the bike is in the air, the player can press a button with the right timing. With correct timing, a scrub is performed along with a speed boost; when it is screwed up it results in a Whip without advantages.

Batman catches Catwoman as she attempts to steal from an enterprise and during the encounter they are interrupted by security guards who do not want Batman to interfere. After a chase that also acts as the tutorial, he learns from Catwoman that the Arkham Blackgate prison has been taken over by Black Mask, Joker and Penguin. They each control a different part of the prison (the industrial complex, administration and cell blocks respectively) and have taken hostages. Batman ventures inside to restore order and he can choose which area to tackle first.\n\nThe game is played on a 2D plane, but with the option to move up and down as well. There are also many sequences, for instance when using the grappling hook combined with different camera perspectives, that Batman seemingly moves around as with full 3D movement and many rooms also have multiple vantage points. The game borrows many mechanics from the main games in the series. During combat Batman can punch, kick, counter, evade and string together combos. The grappling hook is used to move around quickly. He can also run, jump, hang from ledges (and do takedowns from there) and shimmy. By touching and holding the screen an analyzer is activated to scan the area. This can highlight objects important to progress and Batman can for instance interact with them by throwing the batarang. A detective mode is activated to highlight objects in yellow and enemies in red by swiping (Vita) or using the circle pad (3DS). In this mode clues can also be revealed to solve side mysteries and sometimes it is the only way to get access to additional WayneTech. Batman can switch between targets, keep track of them, and for instance attack from the air with a glide kick.\n\nBorrowing elements from the metroidvania genre, the game requires backtracking to open up new routes when certain items have been found, such as an explosive gel or the batclaw, in additional to the batarang provided at the start of the game. There are small amount of stealth, but usually as a means of environment based puzzle solving (i.e. not getting killed instantly) instead of an alternative approach. Batman can for instance rappel up to the rafters or hide in sewer gates. There are one-on-one bossfights and these rely heavily on quick time events. There are also enemies not present in the main Origins game, such as Catwoman and Bronze Tiger. Cut-scenes are shown as still, drawn images with voiceovers and minor animations.","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults, a lower quality in X-2 and some of the collection's added content.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2013-12-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"20163":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"LEGO El Hobbit","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"82fe3124-c07a-4019-9569-2cc7aa3c6e19.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e0d50371-bfa1-4bf9-812a-ec147b106a1c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"071e187a-3b98-4375-92d3-77be4d18bf8c.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7d75b473-38fd-4451-b0aa-8445c8479e6e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"LEGO The Hobbit","Overview":"From the makers of the immensely popular LEGO The Lord of the Rings, comes LEGO The Hobbit, inspired by the first two films in The Hobbit Trilogy: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and the upcoming The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, productions of New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures (MGM) as well as the collection of LEGO The Hobbit constructions sets.

The player controls a protagonist simply known as the The Boy, who is said to enter the world Limbo in search of his sister. However, the story as a whole can also be seen as a metaphor for the search for companionship and getting around in a new environment. Not a single clue is given at the start, there are no cut-scenes and the game starts right away. In that world filled with hazards and danger, his means are few and he is extremely vulnerable. Only two buttons are used, a feeble jump and one to perform an action, combined with movement. This allows him to explore the world and hang on ledges, slide down slopes, push objects, pull levers, and cling to ropes, but the player has to make most of what is present in the environment to get by, often with physics-based elements.\n\nThe gloomy world has a dusty filter showing the game through misted glass, and no vivid colours are present. It is divided into 24 chapters that seamlessly flow into each other, only from the level selection in the main menu can be derived where a new chapter starts. The world is rendered in 2D but with different layers of depth in the scenery. It moves from a forest to an abandoned city and eventually an industrial zone. The player faces three kinds of challenges. There are obstacles where The Boy simply needs to find a way to progress, there are dangerous creatures that hunt him down and try to kill them, and finally there is a gang of children who band together to ward off the intruder and set up traps for him, with a touch of Lord of the Flies. Encounters with other humans are however brief and rare. These account for most of the horror moments, of the psychological kind, with other unnerving sequences like when the player is forced to use the corpses of other children as a bridge.\n\nMusic and sound effects are minimal and there are no on-screen elements referring to health or other statistics. Every single misstep, often with gruesome consequences, is fatal. In the same vein the boy cannot jump from great heights or jump very far. When dead, the game immediately reloads before the current puzzle. Most of the encounters are centered around puzzles and these are sometimes based on timing or speed when being chased. Other elements serve only for setting the scene, when The Boy gets to ride a boat to cross a lake (he cannot swim and drowns immediately) or finds the corpses of the people who did not make it in Limbo. Most of the game elements are discovered through experimentation, like the effects of a glowing worm that attaches itself to The Boy's head, changing the flow of gravity, or what happens when a giant spider captures him. There is only a single path through the levels and generally there is only a single solution to a problem.","Publisher":"Playdead","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Limbo_(video_game)"},"20874":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rayark Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"7ae0666b-f262-443c-b535-46d34b1da814.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cytus Lambda","Overview":"Cytus is a story-based rhythm game divided into several chapters. Gameplay makes use of a system called the Active Scan Line, in which a black line moves up and down across the screen. Black circles called notes appear on the screen as the song plays, and must be interacted with when the scan line passes over them. Depending on the type of note, they may need to be tapped, dragged, or held. Hitting notes with good timing and building up a combo increases the player's score, which is then used to calculate their rank.\n\nSongs are divided into sets called chapters, each of which tells a story. The first ten chapters, I through X, form the main plot of Cytus. They tell the story of a future in the 22nd century in which humanity has been wiped out by a virus. In an attempt to preserve something of themselves, humans uploaded their memories into robot bodies; however, technological limitations necessitated a separate storage system for emotions. The memory storage system, Cytus, allows robots to access their human emotions in the form of music. The story follows a robot named Vanessa as she comes to terms with her new life and identity as a robot.\n\nSeveral chapters exist outside the main story, most of which need to be unlocked through in-app purchases. Each of these chapters tells an isolated story, which is sometimes related to another game by the same developers.","Publisher":"Rayark Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-06-26T00:00:00-07:00"},"20881":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Armature Studio","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"b9d22b0b-70a0-443d-af4a-3c160a492d38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c72328a1-2d01-48a8-9404-afea18d24bb8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c720cef2-6948-47ec-901a-ce232d01da9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0abc6b8d-a8b7-48d8-8cda-a4d1f58ae54c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"beec300b-d874-4541-ac31-41d8e89874a1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d8cf971f-ed29-4bb7-bd3d-45351e651de7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"daa526d5-c74b-4b12-a08b-0074d1336771.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d07d71ec-1bea-4931-8228-15527eb08ca8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"549bbd19-bdd3-4299-a8e8-713a11b00ec5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7141309c-db72-45ea-884b-06e998bb8816.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3c0fc782-3182-4b4f-b04a-28f1208f2c7e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"584ac4a9-2205-4dba-8312-bbec7b9b29e5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"57c78c2a-4698-4467-9d9c-592704fcfcd1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"59b19806-2a4e-4b0b-93b1-f42df22d1a44.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"33b5fc58-3c70-43a9-9236-b88b0f37e206.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"44b613a7-5af1-478d-96ab-db29a20ece3d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b583c75f-568a-4224-aad3-ea121e735f05.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7021f6f2-c014-4bcb-935b-c16c2b7613b9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e657596e-aee5-4394-97f7-8088afd88f31.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b22bd61c-86ce-4c1a-8315-3c826e77febc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"60552c5c-e2c7-4420-ae7f-3686e215bec4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a625634b-50e0-4a2a-a8a2-fa619c31d3ae.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bc69fb79-bed2-4b11-b566-07da4472aa00.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"41e419c9-1692-490b-be2e-f646d19b79bd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"05f0168d-a258-43b6-9dca-9742c603b84c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Injustice: Gods Among Us: Ultimate Edition","Overview":"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting video game based upon the fictional universe of DC Comics.

The player guides a character using a side view through an environment that reacts to actions, movement and input. Most of the times the character does not need to touch anything in the environment for it to react. Shapes start to move, numbers appear, platforms appear or disappear and so on. To get through the puzzle sequences the player always needs to experiment with the effects of input and then find a way to move platforms or overcome obstacles. Initially all reactions are based on movement and jumping, but later on several Vita-specific types of input are used, such as the touchpad, camera and motion functionality.\n\nThere are about 60 puzzle sequences divided over six worlds each with a different theme. The game never provides hints, but often there are clues in the environment, such as numbers adding up to show how shapes can move or percentages changing based on movement. In later levels sequences sometimes have multiple types of checkpoints that can be used to respawn at a further position than when initially starting the sequence. In some levels projectiles can be shot to reveal or hide platforms, or alter parts of the environment. The back camera is for instance used to capture certain colours in the real world to solve puzzles in the game. At the end of each world there is a choice between two doors to progress and the choices by players worldwide are compared.","Publisher":"Digital Dreams","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3v4IFX5hkrk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrico"},"22540":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"0e8e430b-9186-4c38-80bc-4b16e11a11b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"13356001-17f0-455f-9ada-98499c39e888.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"J-Stars Victory Vs","Overview":"Your favorite Shonen Jump heroes jump off the page and duke it out on your screen in J-Stars Victory VS, a 2v2 brawler that features an insane roster filled with manga & anime stars.

Players control Lt. Kai Tana, a PowerLev test pilot who works for the military wing of Earth's defence and deep space research divisions. By entering a black hole she is suddenly miles from home and locked up in a facility where she is studied by aliens called Vokh. The black hole has also altered her characteristics, introducing many bio-mechanical changes. With the help of a character called Hjun Ralan III who works at the space station where is interrogated, she manages to escape. She needs to find a way back and Ralan hopes she will also free his people from the Vokh oppression.\n\nThe game combines two very different types of gameplay. The first type of level is a top-down shooter with puzzle elements controlling her Quarp Jet. These sections are similar to the gameplay of the previous games. Rather than a pure shoot'em up it focuses on the ship's movement, combined with rescuing survivors, shooting enemies and obstacles using a pulse cannon, dropping strategic bombs, solving small puzzles for instance based on switches, and using the series' trademark teleportation technique to quickly hop between fenced off areas. There is also a powerful boost function to move quickly as getting a very fast time is rewarded.\n\nOn the other hand there are 2D side-scrolling platforming sections that are an entirely new element for the series. They are accessed by docking during the top-down flying sections, briefly solving a puzzle to remove a barrier for instance, but they can also form entire levels. Just like the flying sections these levels focus on quick movement and also incorporate teleportation through the ability to launch telepods and a very quick teledash. In the side-scrolling levels Kai Tana can run, jump, glide, collect rekenium shards and needs to avoid dangerous surfaces. While running she can shoot in any direction. Both types of levels have multiple checkpoints. To fully complete a level and earn the maximum amount of experience, multiple objectives need to be completed, such as a fast completion time, scoring a high amount of points, and rescuing all survivors (flying) or gathering all crystals (running).","Publisher":"Futurlab Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RGsrGmIWxV0"},"23314":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mojang Specifications","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Construction and Management Simulation; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"71c231c6-859d-4128-bf0b-60b73ad73388.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9f9c403f-8c71-4e6b-8dbb-3ab8f4f520cb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e167d95-b2a9-4911-ab96-6313a0b53d3f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb2a8727-f57c-48c0-b42d-03cf8546bb73.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"79770871-8dbf-449a-a819-b5a2b29c7338.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8c82f6a9-a04a-4218-bf2b-8889ecff79b2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"eaba69da-325d-4505-a17a-6c9b775cbd1d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Minecraft: Playstation Vita Edition","Overview":"Minecraft is a sandbox building video game which allows players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D world.

Just like the first game it is a platformer and the story picks up after the events of the first game. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and the other characters from the Wasteland start rebuilding their world, when it is threatened by a series of earthquake. The Mad Doctor (always speaking in song) and Oswald team up, and Mickey Mouse, the protagonist of the original game, is brought back in the Wasteland world by Gus, the leader of the Gremlins, and Ortensia, Oswald's girlfriend.\n\nIn contrast to the first game, here Oswald and the Mad Doctor are on Mickey's side. Even more, Oswald becomes a support character for Mickey, as referenced in the title. He is either controlled by the computer or entirely by a different player. The game also supports a drop-in, drop-out system for the second player. As in the first game Mickey's most important way to interact with the environment is through paint and thinner with a reticule controlled separately. Thinner is used to rub out pieces in the environment, while paint can restore parts of the scenery. Paint can also be used to befriend or attack characters. Oswald attacks with a boomerang (using his arms) for ranged combat. He also has a remote control used to zap enemies or to charge items in the environments, and can take off his legs. In addition he can spin his ears to hover in the air and lift Mickey over gaps. He can also revive Mickey and be brought back close again with a group button. In many sequences the two need to work together to solve puzzles. For instance Mickey can drag fireworks to a specific spot and then have Oswald ignite it.\n\nThere are many different environments, such as a Western gulch, a spooky bog and the 1950s-style Autotopia. Next to the movement-based controls for the Wii and Wii U, the PlayStation Move peripheral is supported, but not Kinect for the 360 version. For the Wii U version the GamePad can display the map with hotkeys to zoom in or see the location of objectives. Off-TV play is not supported, as it uses regular split-screen for local co-op.","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-06-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"23505":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eiconic Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2492e6c2-fad9-48fa-acd0-7edcddc2acdd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5c53490e-ef74-48d7-9f7b-b143c604a23a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Total Recoil","Overview":"Look lively soldier, grab your gear and fall in line for the biggest, baddest, craziest and most explosive war game to hit your screens and assault your senses.

However, something goes wrong, the great Cube explodes, and Gomez wakes up in his room now able to traverse this mysterious third dimension. He is greeted by a curious entity named Dot, who claims to be his guide, telling Gomez that it's up to him to find all the pieces of the Cube, and restore the world before the very fabric of existence collapses.\n\nFez is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer with a twist: the world exists in 3D space, but is always viewed as a 2D plane. The player can switch the perspective at any time between four different views; in a similar manner to Crush or Super Paper Mario, Gomez traverses the world as he sees it. Two platforms may be quite far apart, but suddenly appear right next to each other when viewed from the proper direction. Similarly, a hazard may be blocking Gomez' path, but when rotated out of view, it will no longer harm him.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find the 32 Cubes -- some whole, some broken in to eight smaller \"Cube Bits\". The player must manipulate the perspective, as well as various objects that can be moved in 3D space, on order to find and reach them. There are no enemies and few environmental hazards, and if Gomez dies, he simply reappears at the last solid ground he stood upon. There are also many puzzles in the game, entirely optional to basic completion, which are much more subtle, and often require careful observance of the environment.","Publisher":"Polytron Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"23991":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"80b17868-b894-4574-a806-975c1f35a212.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"33306b9b-3953-43c2-b705-8140dd4b6be6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Wolf Among Us","Overview":"The Wolf Among Us is a five episode series from the creators of the 2012 Game of the Year: The Walking Dead.

The game was initially started as Wasteland Kings, a prototype created for the 2013 Mojam game jam. The developers then started work on a full version and took it to Steam's Early Access. Typical for the genre the game is meant to be played in multiple runs, with randomized environments, and weapon and monster placement for each session. It consists of several levels played in succession, each with a different theme, until the character gets a shot to claim the nuclear throne and become the new king. Many levels contain bosses with a brief introduction.\n\nThere is permadeath and up to twelve different playable characters can be unlocked, representing different playing styles. Next to the basic attack each character has a unique secondary action such as a roll or forming a shield, along with a general perk. The game is played as a twin-stick shooter where both movement and firing in any direction can be independently combined. Levels are short and always consist of a single, scrolling room. When all enemies are defeated a vortex appears that sucks the character into the next level. Levels contain random chests with weapons such as a revolver, machinegun, smart gun, minigun, shotgun, rifles, an incinerator, sluggers, bows, grenade launchers and bazookas, but also melee weapons such as a wrench or a screwdriver. Ranged weapons usually have a limited amount of ammo and require ammo pick-ups to keep using them. Up to two weapons can be carried and they can be swapped when a new one is encountered.\n\nEnemies leave behind radioactive fragments known as rads. These can also be found as pick-ups. They fill a meter in the top left corner and when a sufficient amount has been collected the character levels up and a mutation is offered after completing a level. Mutations are perks permanent for that run and include a larger bullet capacity, less damage, more health, better range, better movement speed, slower enemy bullets, increased drops etc. The game supports cooperative offline games for up to two players. Next to the main game there are daily and weekly runs."},"25956":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"General Arcade","Images":[{"FileName":"19e83842-4883-4e91-9e79-ff3674f40783.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eff564a2-bb5c-4e40-a7e7-feec074bb1ae.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition","Overview":"Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition is an enhanced version of Duke Nukem 3D.

This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more.\n\nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you.\n\nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self.\n\nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going.\n\nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out.\n\nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils.\n\nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness.\n\nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve.\n\nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better.\n\nSeems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in.\n\nThat's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.\n\nThis description was compiled from the following reviews:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/articles\/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pspminis.com\/8859\/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here\/","Publisher":"Dakko Dakko"},"26997":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acid Nerve","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"92aecf89-a841-4302-b194-ed1a1dcf1b29.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73fcd7d0-d953-489c-97f9-8273b1b7f54d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2fb31db4-c056-4790-9bb7-9cfe7a08b7fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Titan Souls","Overview":"Titan Souls is a 2015 action-adventure video game developed by UK-based indie studio Acid Nerve and published by Devolver Digital.

With help of the Russalki (giant war machines that guard Sudra), Trace has to fight back the invading forces and return back across The Breach to Earth.\n\nThe world of Sudra is an open world in which Trace can travel back and forth, but needs access to better gear and weapons to keep progressing. Several areas can be travelled to by means of opening up pathways with the items Trace can find along the way. This also involves backtracking. Such items include for instance the Modified Labcoat, Grapple, Laser Drill, Address Disruptor and Remote Drone. Some weapons can be used to open secret paths. None of the available energy based weapons consume ammo. Upgrades for health and weapons can also be found while exploring every nook and cranny. Backtracking is needed for optionally completing the game entirely, but most of the weapons that are needed to finish the game can be found in a linear playthrough. \n\nThe amount of alien flora and fauna on Sudra varies from area to area. The enemies respawn after leaving the general area. After killing them they leave behind some health.","Publisher":"Badland Games","ReleaseDate":"2017-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Axiom_Verge"},"27619":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Phantom Compass","Images":[{"FileName":"a6b20f3e-ca4b-46da-b083-fb2ebd0a4782.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Rollers of the Realm","Overview":"Rollers of the Realm™ combines the frantic physics of classic arcade pinball with the character-driven adventure of fantasy role-playing games.

It's the story of a city known as Caelondia after it has been destroyed by a disaster called \"Calamity\". The game follows a silent protagonist known as \"The Kid\" who tries to create a safe haven (Bastion) with the help of Rucks, who is also the narrator of the game. The kid has to defeat the game's many foes with a variety of melee and ranged weapons and also special skills. The Bastion, which acts as some sort of headquarters in the game, can be upgraded with useful buildings as the player progresses.\n\nAs the Kid travels through the world, he will discover new weapons, upgrade materials, mementos and fragments. Mementos can be discussed with other characters residing in the Bastion and may reveal more about the world. The Kid can only hold two weapons and one special skill at a time, which may require switching them with others, considering the player's preferences and the enemies' weaknesses. The fragments are the game's main currency and they can be collected after destroying objects, defeating enemies and, sometimes, by simply finding them. The player can later use them in the Bastion in order to purchase upgrades and useful trinkets.\n\nThe Bastion encloses a total of six buildings which the Kid can restore and utilize. In the Distillery, the player can assign spirits (drinks) to a maximum of ten slots, providing various passive bonuses during the gameplay. At the beginning, only one slot is available for use, the rest being unlocked one by one every time the Kid levels up. The Arsenal stores all the weapons that the protagonist gathers during his adventures; the player can switch weapons and special skills here. The weapons are enhanced and upgraded in the Forge, and this is possible only after collecting the required upgrade materials in the world. The Memorial offers various challenges, which if completed reward the player with additional fragments. In Lost-and-Found, the player can spend fragments in order to restore upgrade materials and unlock idols and spirits. Finally, the game difficulty can be increased by invoking the gods in the Shrine.\n\nOne of the notable features in the game is dynamic narration. Narrating in the game is based on the player's actions. For example, when the kid has fallen from a height the narrator gives a comment about the incident.","Publisher":"Limited Run Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bastion_(video_game)"},"30044":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ac50cd69-25d1-4a1e-aa50-385abeb3adb9.png","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Gyossait","Overview":"Gyossait is a side-scrolling platform game with a horror theme. The player controls Oyeatia, the creator and god of mankind. He surrenders his divine privileges to travel to Earth in search of his lost love. That is Gyossait, a mythical woman who sleeps in the heart of the dying planet and who has her dreams seep into the mind of man.\n\nAfter Oyeatia crashes down to Earth, he travels through different environments to trace Gyossait. She often leaves behind messages written in the backgrounds and there are also short cut-scenes. Everything is controlled through the keyboard. The character can move around and jump. Initially no means of attack are available. The only available action is to raise a shield and deflect bullets to return them to enemies. The goal of each section is to reach the exit to the next part. This often involves puzzles including launch pads, switches, and keys. At a certain point Oyeatia learns the ability to temporarily transform (beheaded, with a bleeding stump where his head was) and attack enemies with an endless amount of bullets. Activating the form is often optional through an object in the environment. In the \"fighting\" form it is often not possible to activate switches and solve certain puzzles. When dead, the character respawns at the beginning of the level. He has but a single life, so every hit leads to a restart.\n\nThere is a strong focus on sound to enhance the atmosphere, and in the opening scenes the author suggests to play the game with low lighting and minimal external distraction."},"30319":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Roll7","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"11630802-03a2-4b41-a3ad-d82a991280b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efd03241-43ab-44e3-bda7-1aa358bf8c50.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eb8f3ee5-6e7d-4a5e-984d-1427f2fa7902.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood","Overview":"Drop in to Olliwood and prepare for finger-flippin’ mayhem in this follow up to cult skateboarding smash OlliOlli.

He is a thief who finds a device called Volume that is a military training simulator, but allows users to simulate heists in virtual worlds as well. The game opens showing how Locksley is discovered and captured. It then rewinds three hours and 100 missions explain what happened before. Locksley broadcasts his simulated heists over the internet for anyone to match and finds an antagonist in Guy Gisborne, CEO of Gisborne Industries, who has also taken over the country of England. More of the story and the background is revealed through notes found during missions. Volume also has artificial intelligence called Alan who guides Locksley through the mechanics and has conversations about events while the missions are in progress.\n\nThe game is played from an elevated, almost top-down perspective and consists of short, maze-like levels. To complete a level Locksley needs to collect all gems and then the exit opens up. Levels are guarded by characters called Pawns. They are stationary or patrol and it is possible to see their line of sight through a cone. When they discover Locksley they go after him and shoot. The level then has to be restarted unless a checkpoint has been activated first. There are no means to kill opponents, so strategy is always about distractions and staying unnoticed. Locksley can cling to walls, with slower movement, but at the same time ducking slightly to stay out of sight when near lower objects. The game moves to a completely top-down perspective at that time and it is possible to hop between walls around corners. He can also move in any direction while walking regularly.\n\nThe initial approach to distract guards is by whistling, but eventually many types of gadgets are introduced. Gadgets can only be used when they are present in levels. The first one introduced is the Bugle that can be fired in any direction. When it is set off, also in flight, it makes a sound that draws attention. The Oddity has similar mechanics, but can only be shot at a high wall, where it will attract the attention of a guard for some time when it is spotted. Mute gives a temporary speed boost and mutes the sound of pressure plates. Gadgets generally take some time to recharge, but can be used without limits. During levels only one gadget can be carried at a time. Locksley can also flush toilets or run water taps to create sounds, and he can hide in closets behind doors.\n\nAdvanced levels include new types of opponents such as turrets, and hounds with a 180 degrees line of sight. Guards will often activate alarms alerting the others when Locksley is spotted. They will then run much faster and it can only be averted by hiding for a while or hacking the security system to disable the alarm. Some levels have pressure plates that make a sound and sometimes there are forcefields blocking the path that require some time to deactivate. Levels do not always have a single solution and can often be solved in different ways.\n\nThe game includes an editor that allows users to create and share custom levels online. It is also possible to edit and remix the existing levels."},"31459":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Novarama","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1bc91363-cc02-470e-89cc-4ea4f991b6e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43dd5794-5d1b-4649-96fc-6acea2ace92a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4353a3e1-21a4-46a7-aa14-0dee473db444.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Invizimals: The Alliance","Overview":"Get ready for some fun on the run as the hunt for Invizimals goes anywhere and everywhere.

It is set in the same universe as Eternity's Child and it is very similar to the earlier titles Mecho Wars and the remake Mecho Wars HD by the same development team and many characters from those games return. Just like in Mecho Wars two factions known as Winged Crusade and Landians fight over land and resources. The single-player campaign is split up in three episodes with multiple levels each, in-game story sequences with events and conversations between characters.\n\nThe turn-based battles combine fights with resource management. Different types of buildings such as factories and cities can be captured by infantry. Once captured, they generate an amount of gold per turn that can be used at those locations to train new units. They are divided into four types: infantry, heavy, air and water with multiple units per type. They each have a cost and different statistics based on movement, attack range, an offensive bonus against certain types and a weakness against certain types. Slower and heavy units can often attack from a distance and take a lot of damage, but movement is slow and they are weak against certain types. During a turn the player can move units, train new ones, capture buildings and attack. For movement a green grid shows the available options.\n\nThere terrain also influences the gameplay. A road and a bridge lower the defenses, but improves movement, while a mountain extends the attack range. There are flying units that can travel anywhere and water units that can cross large gaps and attack from a distance. Cacti are used to replenish health. The game uses a day-and-night system with an hour per turn. At night, water freezes and units have the ability to travel over the ice. In the story campaign there are different win conditions, but usually opponents need to be defeated and buildings need to be captured. Once captured they change colour, but the opponent can also retake them. Buildings can only be captured by fast, but weak infantry units. Battles are shown in a separate screen with a side view and are executed automatically. The attack is shown as well as the damage done to the opposition, with two large health bars near the top. Before attacking a percentage of success is shown at the targeted unit. A single unit almost always represents a larger group and some creatures have the ability to retaliate right away.\n\nIn the skirmish game mode custom battles in all levels are available. They are played as games of Conquest (capture all H.Q. structures) or Annihilation (defeat all enemies). Online multiplayer is supported with an additional game type, Assassination, where a specific, marked creature needs to be defeated to win the game. For multiplayer games a turn time can be defined as 5 or 20 minutes, or 8 or 24 hours. Multiple games can be played at the same time, in both single-player and multiplayer and these can be accessed right away from a menu by clicking a snapshot of the area. The game also includes unlockable perks to customize the armies.","Publisher":"Nine Tales Digital"},"34013":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","Genres":"MMO; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"4f5e0c57-c386-4ec0-bfb4-85b6803abfd6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Monster Hunter Frontier G","Overview":"Monster Hunter: Frontier G was an expansion pack for Monster Hunter Frontier Z, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in the Monster Hunter series for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, and Wii U.[2][3][4] As of August 2014, the game had 4.5 million registered players.[5] The entire Monster Hunter Frontier service was officially shut down on December 18, 2019 after going free-to-play for its final month."},"34180":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team Meat","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"06db243f-cad1-4dba-b29c-063d49ebf2ee.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"05db6222-f1f9-4575-b5bd-a9c5ddb0d11d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"717a75d9-dfbb-46f4-9e90-6040e29215dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e0d2270f-f7b8-40c3-beea-00fd8c2a8333.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Super Meat Boy","Overview":"Super Meat Boy is an independent video game designed by Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes and developed by Team Meat. It is the successor to McMillen and Jonathan McEntee's 2008 Flash game Meat Boy. Super Meat Boy was released on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade in October 2010, on Microsoft Windows in November 2010, on OS X a year later in November 2011, on Linux in December 2011 as a part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4, in May 2012 as a part of the Humble Indie Bundle V, and on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in October 2015. In the game the player controls Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing as the player runs and jumps through over 300 hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. Additional player-created levels are available for free download.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in January 2009. McMillen worked on level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested primarily by the pair and their families. Initially intended for release in early 2010 for personal computers and the WiiWare download service, the release date was pushed back as the design was changed to include more levels and exclude multiplayer modes. The WiiWare version was canceled due to the service's technical limitations. The music for the game was created by Danny Baranowsky, who had also composed the music for Meat Boy. The soundtrack was released as an album, and music from it was released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3.\n\nThe game was critically acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned that not all players would appreciate the level of difficulty. The game was a commercial success, and sold more than one million copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development.[1]","Publisher":"Team Meat","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34407":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"f81d1174-8722-4a33-be08-2dcae0e37528.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f601d7dc-456b-4db3-95d0-6ca1490e1be1.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bac8182e-2752-474d-9377-69282e13fcbe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend","Overview":"The most definitive installment of the renouned 2D fighting game franchise, BlazBlue, can finally be taken into your living room.

While those put a twist on the concept of Robotron: 2084, Resogun draws inspiration from Defender, but with fixed patterns of enemies similar to Galaga rather than randomized attacks. The game consists of five levels (Acis, Ceres, Decima, Febris, and Mefitis) with bright neon colours where the player steers a space ship that needs to survive as long as possible through three phases followed by a boss. Levels consist of backdrops that are wrapped around as a cylinder and it is possible to get a glimpse of the other side of the level. The ship can shoot and move left or right and there is no border to it.\n\nBonuses are earned by saving humans. These are shown as green figures locked up in chambers. Different types of space ships will attempt to kill the humans, who are only vulnerable when they are out of the chamber, and this need to be prevented by shooting down the invaders. At certain moments a human will be freed when certain enemies marked in green called keepers are destroyed. The ship can then pick up the human and drop it off at a marked location to set it free and receive bonuses such as boost, overdrive (more powerful weapons), smart bombs (clear the screen), shield or extra points. Boost provides a short moment of invincibility where the ship can crash into other ships destroying them, but also extending the boost. That way it can be maintained for a long time if the ship races through the enemy formations in a structured way.\n\nPower-ups and bonuses appear as large green crosses that can be shot to open them. Players are encouraged to keep the destruction going to maintain a score multiplier, which has a different cap based on the chosen difficulty level. The game can be played in an arcade mode (complete the levels one after another) or with single levels. There are four difficulty settings (Rookie, Experienced, Veteran, and Master) and three ships (Nemesis, Ferox, and Phobos) to choose from with different parameters for agility, boost and overdrive. The game supports online cooperative multiplayer games, but not local ones.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC","ReleaseDate":"2014-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34997":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalanche","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"5c933759-2348-497e-9477-1d7f678b7d4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c5c8a216-80b2-4ae5-b0b4-01f3bb1c4001.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition","Overview":"Heroes and villains.

Unexpectedly, robots across the United States begin to go haywire and attack anyone and everything, leaving the humanoid Beck and Call as the only bots still functioning properly. Beck is a combat robot and the latest in the Mighty Numbers line, and the only among them able to manipulate Xels, the nanomachines that all robots are comprised of. Thus, he is asked by his creator, Dr. White, to bring the other Mighty Numbers back to their senses and discover the source of the robot affliction.\n\nGameplay is heavily inspired by the Mega Man series, and consists of running and gunning across platform levels while defeating enemies along the way. Beck's basic weapon is fairly weak, but once he has sufficiently damaged an enemy, he can dash into them to instantly defeat them and absorb their Xels. Each enemy has a different type of Xel, which can grant Beck temporary power-ups such as healing or increased defense. After defeating another Mighty Number in a boss battle, Beck may also use their unique Xels to transform and gain new weaponry. Call is also available in co-op play; while she cannot absorb Xels, she falls slower, dashes farther, and has a shield that absorbs projectiles.","Publisher":"Deep Silver"},"35287":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Climax Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e9c257b7-7c4a-4b8b-9743-804f60d0d1e3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d81f0b87-4d22-4af5-8409-2227e0e4760f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles","Overview":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles is a compilation containing:\nAssassin's Creed Chronicles: China\nAssassin's Creed Chronicles: India\nAssassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia","Publisher":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"92550":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beatshapers","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9fbc5d7e-2343-4d89-aa88-4d628e66c8f7.png","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2ecb152f-7e39-40c4-b02c-5305da993144.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"44e11b3d-0062-425a-b321-0ec056b70ca7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Z-Run","Overview":"Z-Run thrusts you into a world that has fundamentally been overrun by a virus that has mutated people into flesh eating zombies that will do anything for their next meal.","Publisher":"Beatshapers","ReleaseDate":"2014-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dgug6sDkE1w"},"93200":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Honeyslug","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"dd0dd825-89d2-4801-844a-7df692721dde.png","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Exploding Zoo","Overview":"Round up herds of exploding animals and rampage around 80 destructible levels - defend your precious egg by slamming your herd into the greedy alien marauders and blowing them up.

Run!","Overview":"Run Sackboy! Run! is an endless runner platform game featuring the lead character from the LittleBigPlanet series. When starting out we find Sackboy being chased by the Negativitron and it's up to the player to help him out so that he is not caught. Like in other games of its kind all forward movement is automatic and all the player has to do is tap the screen at the right time to make Sackboy jump. Jumping is needed to avoid obstacles and enemies as well as collecting bubbles and other items that can be found. Colliding with an obstacle like spikes or an enemy and the game ends, however enemies are knocked out if jumped onto. What also needs to be avoided is the pink goo which slows down Sackboy and allows the Negativitron to catch up. To escape it the player has to swipe across the screen to gain speed.\n\nThe game is free-to-play and the bubbles are the main currency used in the game. These are collected in the game but can also be acquired with real money. In the game's shop bubbles can be used to acquire costumes and power-up upgrades as well as lucky chests with random content. Like in many other free-to-play games there are boosts that can be activated before a game and also these cost bubbles. Another way to spend bubbles is to skip mission challenges. Missions are done by clearing specific objectives and by doing them the player can level up. By levelling up the player's score multiplier increases. Another object that the player can collect in the game as well as acquire with real money are the save-me-hearts. These can be used at the game over screen to revive Sackboy and allows the player to continue playing without losing his score.\n\nSome power-ups can be found around the stages and they are automatically activated when picked up. This includes a magnet that allows Sackboy to collect bubbles at a a greater range and the jetpack which allows him to fly. They are active for a limited amount of time but by spending bubbles on upgrades this time can be extended. Other objects that can be collected are stickers. Once all stickers of a certain theme have been collected the player is awarded with a special prize. There are also some stickers that unlock content in other LittleBigPlanet games.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment Europe","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"125594":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ratchet & Clank: QForce"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Insomniac Games","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f1dbe719-d569-4846-a305-80e0b53029e4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"62ec4e75-2e3d-41c5-845c-f0f0cacc8fd8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3d90d6c4-8199-4a65-88ea-fdd5e3b6b3c3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault","Overview":"In this installment of the popular intergalactic franchise, Ratchet & Clank, along with the galaxy's own Captain Qwark, must stop a sneaky villain from Qwark's past.

The game consists of circa 40 levels divided over five environments. Shown from an isometric-like viewpoint, Lara is guided through swipes. A level is built up through nodes connected by lines. A swipe moves Lara to the next node as long as the path is not obstructed. Puzzle elements appear through obstacles and branching node paths. Levers are used to move platforms and certain path elements are fragile so they can only be crossed a few times before they disappear. Certain levers or switches are only active for a few turns.\n\nThere are animals (snakes, spiders, lizards ...) and enemies that can move every turn as well and have different movement patterns. Lara can take them out with a gun or a throwable spear, but they often need to be positioned in a certain direction so Lara is not attacked after completing a turn and moving to a node where she is vulnerable. There are also moving traps such as saw blades or rolling boulders that change position with every turn. Unlike Hitman Go that focuses more on stealth, this game is entirely about puzzle-solving and introduces vertical planes with surfaces that can be climbed next to horizontal ones.\n\nAlong the way Lara can collect hidden gems and fragments that form relics. It is a commercial game with in-app purchases to access the solutions for all levels and additional outfit packs.\n\nVersion 2.0 (November, 2015) introduced a new chapter - Cave of Fire featuring 11 new levels with harder puzzles, a new gameplay mechanic, new collectible items and so on.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2016-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lara_Croft_Go"},"131998":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"b6acf37c-d04f-4139-a54f-38310cc9bc76.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"621a2557-ee82-4e59-a8d5-2eb6489bdfd9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2158ad3-cbc3-4e23-9879-67362841643d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b5ebcb4-d69e-46d5-baa2-91b82e59a77a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f386c00c-dc01-441f-a7a9-ecb954f6562e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f0c79f79-d06a-4071-b580-fcbba3a6b5f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4f6b0e39-744c-46a4-bc44-f2f44e8f5d9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c0ee5767-68cc-4597-8323-2584c4ebfd85.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA X","Overview":"Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA X is the tenth release in the Project Diva series.

Their mission is to observe human interaction, intervene when needed, and report the daily goings-on in the dormitory for the sake of their home planet.

Moreover, they must conduct the operation in the shadows without revealing their true nature to their gargantuan subjects.

The story is a direct continuation of the movie and deals with an experiment gone wrong: Oscorp researches a cross-species mutation virus; the same which caused Lizard to appear. This virus reaches Manhattan and Spider-Man has to help the infected humans and find a cure.\n\nThis version returns to the open world-concept which was abandoned in the previous few instalments. Spider-Man swings through Manhattan, although the web-shooting is performed automatically by pressing a button, on the way to the next plot point. Those are linear levels in which Spider-Man visits locations like sewers or laboratories and spends most of his time fighting enemies, including the new robot foes. The combat system is reminiscent to the free-flow system used in the Batman: Arkham series: Spidey quickly moves between enemies and bashes them; when his spider-sense goes off the player needs to use the evade button before getting hit. Becauses of Spider-Man's special abilities, he can walk on the ceiling and evade some combat sequences or use his web for a stealth takedown. It is also possible to quickly retreat to the ceiling in case the hero is on the losing side of battle. Besides combat, the levels feature maneuvering, a few open-the-door puzzles and boss fights.\n\nOf course there are various distrations in the open world sequences, the most important being side missions. In those Spidey has to solve smaller tasks like exploring Oscorp labs, passing acrobatic challenges, photographing stuff or bringing infected people to a clinic. All this rewards experience points which can be used to improve Spider-Man's abilities. The collectibles in this game are comic book pages which unlock iconic Spider-Man issues. When in the open world, the player can activate Spidey's web rush ability by choosing on of the designated points on the map: then the game takes control and automatically swings to the point.","Publisher":"Activision Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"164647":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pyramid","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"2926be5f-c2a7-42e1-8bcd-92ac4011e411.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4308beab-63e2-46c8-a86e-bba73632cc4c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e7fe3ba-45c8-4cb3-84c7-cd6db0cb8870.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1dfc35fc-321a-47ea-b027-65d06b705882.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a60da2de-fd24-49c5-b8be-c88d3acda699.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8a8b0132-6f2d-46a5-9ea6-b69bc2d4fdf6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4cb2908a-30fc-4297-8345-a47b4fe50db7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours","Overview":"DARIUSBURST Chronicle Saviours is the latest installment in Taito's DARIUS series of arcade-style shooting games.

It was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in October 2016, for Microsoft Windows in November 2017, and for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in November 2018. Returning to a more traditional gameplay style from earlier Final Fantasy titles, it revolves around turn-based battles which utilize the series' recurring Active Time Battle system, augmented with a stacking mechanic where stacking allied characters and monsters affects stats and turn numbers. An enhanced edition, called World of Final Fantasy Maxima, was released on November 6, 2018, and has have avatar change to transform into a classic Final Fantasy character.\n\nWorld of Final Fantasy is primarily set in the world of Grymoire, a land populated by classic Final Fantasy characters and monsters from across the series, while being unconnected to any other series entry. The storyline focuses on twin siblings Lann and Reynn, who suffer from amnesia and hold the power in one of their arms to capture and wield Mirages, the monsters of Grymoire. Lann and Reynn travel to Grymoire to recover their memories, gradually mastering their powers and becoming involved in the conflicts consuming the world - these include fights between rival factions within the native Lilikins, and the impending threat of the Bahamutian Army.\n\nDevelopment started around the concept of a Final Fantasy title aimed at a wider and younger audience, focusing on a light tone and stylised graphics compared to the mainline entries. It was directed by Hiroki Chiba, who had worked as a scenario writer and event planner for the series and also wrote the scenario for World of Final Fantasy. The chibi character designs, which had been used for Pictlogica Final Fantasy, were created by Yasuhisa Izumisawa; the larger characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The music was composed primarily by Masashi Hamauzu, who also included arranged versions of classic themes while aiming for the music to be lighter in tone.\n\nFirst announced at the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, World of Final Fantasy was intended as a celebratory title to commemorate the series' 30th anniversary. A worldwide release was planned from an early stage, with localization running parallel to the development and Japanese voice recording. In order to keep the characters true to their original appearances, the localization staff who first handled them were brought in to translate their dialogue.","Publisher":"Square Enix Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"164677":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ixtl","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"ffdb4ad0-8436-4eba-822e-216792a657e3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"09d27704-0711-454b-85cc-1bb19d520d64.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a926c02-d4f5-48a4-a9de-e73ea66a7114.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3ca121d8-a707-4073-ba7e-e3806eeb942c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Muv-Luv Alternative","Overview":"This is it.

Take on the challenge of using modern day weapons like rifles and shotguns.\n\nFor the first time in the series, the game will have Buddy characters that participate in battles to help the player, in contrast to Supporter characters that only worked behind the scenes in past games. There are situations where tanks are placed on the battlefield, which you can enter and control tanks to annihilate monsters. When the girls are attacked by monsters, their clothes will gradually be destroyed as they receive damage. The more the clothes are destroyed, the more damage is received for the same attacks.\n\nThe key feature in the series, ‘Interrogation Training’, is a mode where the player can tickle or slightly annoy the girls by simulating a situation in which they are caught by an enemy. You can use various interrogation items like water guns and condensed milk. The character’s mood changes and gives a different response depending on the item used in the interrogation.","Publisher":"D3Publisher","ReleaseDate":"2018-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"172921":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Experience Inc.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"257f1e9c-3787-4b43-8aac-07c029f12a60.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a734522c-95c3-412b-b8cd-09cfb05619ef.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Demon Gaze II","Overview":"Magnastar has spellbound the people of Asteria into obeying him.

One day she finds a speaking book which bears not only the soul of the alchemist Platcha, but also promises of a powerful alchemy item. Unfortunately the book suffers from amnesia which has to be countered by adding new alchemy recipes.\n\nThe biggest change in comparison to the earlier part of the series is the removal of the time limits (except for a few side quests). To gain recipes and progress in the plot, Sophie simply has to follow her ideas (basically hints for what to do next), e.g. visiting a location, defeating a monster or talking to someone. Time still plays an important part because the night\/day cycle, day of the week and weather influences the behaviour of the town people and which ingredients\/enemies can be found in the game world.\n\nThose are required for using the alchemy system, as usually the heart of the game. After activating a cauldron, it is represented with a grid as well as colored orbs. An item is created by putting ingredients, which have a shape and a colour. All those properties interact with each other, for example when two ingredients overlap, the impact of the underlying one is lost and the placement of orbs in relation to the orbs (if they are near of overlap) influences the outcome. There are also different cauldrons which have special impacts on the process, e.g. one makes especially powerful items but has a time limit.\n\nWhen exploring the areas, Sophie and her party (up to four people overall) will encounter monsters to fight. Then the game switches to a round-based system where the player gives order like attacking, defending, using items or using abilities. The new stance system replaces the previous support system: each character has offensive and defensive stances which can be chosen instead of a regular command. Then the character automatically uses an appropriate action when their turn comes. This powers up the chain meter; the higher the more effective the actions become. When multiple characters have their meter up, a very powerful special attack which drains the meter is performed.","Publisher":"Koei Tecmo Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182558":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ArtDink","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"63384fe4-0356-4341-995c-4f30657060fc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9f7ee30c-02ab-4b77-ab78-b9035bd2afaf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"937660a7-9404-4222-9325-fbd96045851e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b3f8027-a2e9-451f-83ba-227074dc2f9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7f62f047-b0e1-41c5-abb7-3d19037d9f98.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4fbf33a6-5c44-4050-9860-9c96308bb750.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Accel World vs. Sword Art Online","Overview":"Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight is an action role-playing video game developed by Artdink and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows.

The game is divided into 12 main episodes, an epilogue, and 3 additional episodes that focus on side characters. Gameplay itself is split between the simulation segments in which the player interacts with Ion and develops their friendship, and visual novel segments that explore Ion's memories.\n\nIon is an amnesiac girl who lives in a sealed world, where her only companion is a shopkeeper named Nelico. One day, a strange terminal appears in her room, and though she cannot receive any sound or visuals through it, it does give her a mental connection to the person on the other side. The player is that person, and their Playstation Vita is the tool they use to communicate with Ion. Though she lives on her own schedule and may not always be available to talk to, the more the game is played, the more Ion will try to synchronize her schedule with the player's. The player is able to talk to Ion, ask her to synthesize new items such as clothes, go on dates with her, and dive into her dream world to try recovering her lost memories.\n\nIon's dream world is heavily damaged, and the player must fix it by using the PS Vita's camera to read bar codes from the real world. Scanned bar codes will create fairy-like creatures called Sharls, which will then work to repair the damaged memories once the player has spent Hymmno Points to make a pact with them. The most efficient way to earn Hymmno Points is through online play, and other online options also exist that allow players to communicate with one another and interact with each others' Sharls.","Publisher":"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2012-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ciel_Nosurge"},"182572":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zeboyd Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"4914b96e-795b-4d5a-ba3a-bb791bb075f1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"95dc15af-5aa7-4831-959b-f80f9e69f9b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36e82007-090b-4daa-8e0c-ddc519e4cedf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a8ca1c7b-2bfb-4953-be3f-8eb3794bd4fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2c384959-58e7-438a-95ea-2f85dd18acb4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"68f381b9-68c7-4bf5-8c45-24e76f55667b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c81d955f-c121-4634-b8b4-40045225071c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aef7f256-e3b9-4141-a9a3-bc96e73a5c36.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"899dfa75-eba1-4f02-91d7-70960c4f7040.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cosmic Star Heroine","Overview":"Alyssa L'Salle was one of the top secret agents at the Agency of Peace & Intelligence on the Planet Araenu.

In the AD Dimension Might Senpuuji, the richest boy on the planet, fights against criminals in Nouvelle Tokyo while the girls of Arzenal island, stripped of all rights because of their inability to manipulate Mana, protect the world from incursions of dragons in order to pay for their continued existence. In the Universal Century Dimension a broken world, ravaged by endless war between the Federation and Neo Zeon and the global ecological disaster of Third Impact, attempts to heal as the independent military group Mithril investigates the source of Out Of Place technology derived from the Whispered: people aware of technology that does not exist. Behind the scenes god-like figures secretly manipulate the events of the three Earths to their own goals, with no regard for the innocent lives lost in the process.\n\nSuper Robot Wars V is a standalone title in the long-running series, marking the 25th anniversary of the Super Robot Wars franchise. This entry also marks the first appearance of Space Battleship Yamato in the SRW series, which is notable for not actually having any robots.The player starts by selecting their point-of-view character, either the washed up pilot haunted by his past failures Souji Murakumo, or the out of her depth rookie with no experience Chitose Kisaragi. This pilot can be renamed, and depending on the pilot their reactions during cutscenes, and some missions, will change. During a routine mission the pilot will chance upon the experimental mecha suit VangRay, falling into the Yamato's crew and joining them on their journey across space and dimensions.\n\nAs in past SRW games SRW V follows the game flow of Base mode, followed by Adventure mode, followed by Scenario mode, and then back again. In Adventure mode the player watches the events of the storyline play out, occasionally making a decision of which storyline route to follow. In Scenario mode the player deploys their forces to defeat their opponents or achieve specific objectives. In Base mode the player spends currency earned in Scenario mode to upgrade their units.","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/18otfdWJlLI"},"184087":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Super Robot Wars X"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"B.B.Studio","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"0e9557e6-6c2b-481c-91b7-c943b7ac9d72.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c71c0d1d-9fa2-4036-a79c-fb3b9f09345e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8adb33eb-3fc0-4c78-af8b-765b8e1fe950.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"6b01f627-7007-4e07-b042-15b05fe0c512.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0f354f10-1b96-4c32-a40f-807d84879518.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0276aa6b-4327-4b0f-ab2d-8eb4d35bf092.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b7252b6b-431b-4a7f-a4fc-73c9c8465160.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b7f99d29-d4bd-4324-9b52-4a14272bf51f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Robot Taisen X","Overview":"The fates of warriors X-cross once again in a new world.\n\nThe latest in the Super Robot Wars series!

Other than those points, the gameplay is pretty much the same as the first.","Publisher":"Xseed Games","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Y317B0h42MY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Legend_of_Heroes:_Trails_of_Cold_Steel_II"},"184152":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"K2 Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"bd588971-7831-4202-964b-577beffa8b8f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a61130ab-29e5-43de-92c6-6584f271b764.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"acabd9cc-eb21-4a0d-b3f8-40490ae4ecdd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d38e028-2fab-45d8-9911-a74d258f81d8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"689c1341-c044-41f1-9ad2-c686668bf371.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a65472f2-a5a8-4ac9-b3c8-66a9ed99890a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a8bb11a3-75d3-4d32-848a-1d60f5808f91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f6e0ebff-3914-407f-a256-72a9c7ad1020.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Valhalla Knights 3","Overview":"Carceron Prison.

It is also the first Ys game in which the main protagonist is not Adol Christin, the red-haired swordsman and recurrent hero of the series.\n\nThere are three main playable characters in the game: Yunica Tovah, a young apprentice knight; Hugo Fact, a skillful magician; and a mysterious person known as The Claw, who can be unlocked only after having completed the game with the other two. These characters venture to the sinister Darm Tower, each having her or his own motives. The three also vary in gameplay style: Yunica plays similarly to Adol from the previous games, specializing in melee combat with swords and axes; Hugo fires magical bullets with his staff and has access to other types of magic; The Claw is distinguished by his speed in close combat.\n\nThe game is set entirely in the Darm Tower, discarding the overworld and populated areas of the previous games. The fast-paced action RPG gameplay is similar to the one adopted in Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim and Ys: The Oath in Felghana. As the story progresses, characters acquire skills that can be combined in order to extend battle strategy. Some of the bosses from the first and the second Ys re-appear in this game.","Publisher":"DotEmu SAS","ReleaseDate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/dJQ8sQCp-vQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ys_Origin"},"184206":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"シュタインズ・ゲート エリート","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MAGES.

The story is tied directly to the first game and is set between 1985 and 1991, but with an anachronistic order. While the first game offered only two playable characters with each one tied to specific parts of the game, the sequel offers a larger playable cast. Each level offers a single character or a small selection to choose from and each character offers a distinct perspective of the events. The character selection is similar to the use of masks in the first game. Each character has a specific set of abilities and perks, such as a faster speed, the ability to dodge roll, dual weapons, melee weapons only, Alex and Ash Davis as twins who use a chainsaw and guns and one is invincible as long as the other is alive, faster aiming, a silenced pistol, executions with firearms etc. Some characters allow the player to choose from different skillsets or weapons.\n\nJust like the original game the gameplay is fast and a single attack is often lethal, meaning levels are meant to be replayed multiple times until all enemy patterns are figured out. Levels have specific objectives and in most of them all enemies need to be killed. Short scenes between the missions further the story. Enemies downed with melee attacks need to be executed to prevent them from coming back, players have to take into account a line of sight through windows, also to avoid snipers, various weapons can be picked up and thrown etc. It is still possible to slightly view ahead to anticipate. Unlike the original game there are now two difficulty levels. 'Hard' is unlocked after completing the campaign on 'normal'. Enemies become harder to defeat and certain abilities, such as enemy locking, are removed. The game includes a level editor made available some time after the release. It can be used not only to create levels, but also cutscenes with dialog.","Publisher":"Devolver Digital, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/g7ZaK3nf2_E"},"184430":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mongoose","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d2868b48-ae00-4617-b6a3-d446b8061602.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b45651a5-abd6-4fcd-99c6-0fad1fc6460b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ed357eb6-215a-4502-90ce-4e312b534093.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ef47197f-3025-4c6d-a2c6-25475e40d69d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"I Am the Hero","Overview":"I Am the Hero is a pixel art, beat 'em up, fighting game that tells the story of a \"Hero\" with a glorious but mysterious past.

Player interactions may have the effect of altering your confidence or 'spirit,' or doing the same to the other idols. Giving yourself an edge in these interactions will be important for the 'Death Concerts.'\n\nPlayers will be then assessed on their dancing and overall performance, the most logical way to determine the ultimate idol, as well as a staple of the idol genre. During these 'Death Concerts' the idols that didn’t make it through to the final judging are killed. There are currently hints from the publisher that idols can be brought back to life through a series of trials.","Publisher":"D3Publisher","ReleaseDate":"2016-10-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/eQEm6vJzphI"},"184432":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Frontwing","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"f28bf1b3-eda4-4956-91cf-917d8e53faf4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a2486d79-7550-4cf4-996e-cc81a3e612a5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bed02d25-cafe-476f-ae70-a65dfeccc93f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6924e2c5-78da-43b5-9992-ff669fae183f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"83ed936a-34b4-4c1c-930e-9494dd85889f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"73588011-d7dd-4575-b48c-df609e99f80d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Island","Overview":"Urashima is a small island, far from mainland Japan. It’s a true utopia, blessed with rich natural beauty. But the island harbors a difficult past, and it’s about to be erased, silently, from history.\n\nSoot blight syndrome, an endemic disease, has brought about a rift between the island and the mainland. An offshore platform intended for marine research has long been left abandoned; five years ago, three separate incidents brought the once influential Three Families of Urashima to near ruin. Rumors about children being spirited away have become part of the local folklore, alongside another legend, one that has been repeated on the island since time immemorial...\n\n“Let me tell you the legend of this island: it’s a story of tragic love...”\n\nThe key to saving the island lies with three girls, each of whom belongs to one of the Three Families. These girls aren’t able to change the fate of the island by themselves, but might they succeed with the help of the young man who’s just washed ashore? Claiming that he’s traveled back in time, the man immediately sets out on a lonely path, challenging the longstanding traditions of the island, and seeking to change the future. But those aren’t his only goals...\n\nHow will his presence transform the lives of these three girls, the future of the island, and the fate of the world...?","Publisher":"PROTOTYPE Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/iGCZ1Dn3Zv0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Island_(visual_novel)"},"184433":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KADOKAWA CORPORATION","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"1fb6994f-d99e-425c-8ef7-7b7492f0916b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fc7257cd-a9b3-4aaf-a1b6-502cd3a5536a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9cd8f093-c4bb-495b-a37c-96cf93727c28.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"003e586b-befc-487a-a072-8b090dfa01d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1b3290e0-caa9-4969-9d1f-c8155c0b4149.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a11094f1-1d87-4241-99e4-5fb302b7e4ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kan Colle Kai","Overview":"Kan Colle Kai is a Strategy game, developed and published by Kadokawa, which was released in Japan in 2016","Publisher":"KADOKAWA","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/8tEvFFtSh0E"},"184434":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NIGORO","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"1cd08846-bab9-455e-a8ea-3d69fce383b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0f9fecb2-9617-485f-8cf8-616b88efc59f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"144a4db6-086e-469a-9402-137fb37ca235.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5986521c-aeff-45e4-8e99-e9021f34c1b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"011238a7-e2c9-404b-b535-557c3f4559f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9b823ecb-c91d-4c52-b2f0-d924ff050db0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"345c1d7f-340c-4e45-b36a-9f8bf96f40c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"La-Mulana EX","Overview":"La-Mulana is a remake of the original La-Mulana released in 2005.

It has more modern graphics and sound, but still closely resembles the original game in overall design. Just like the original game the player controls the blue character Putty through different levels where he has to free red characters that have been taken prisoner by invading forces. The game is played as a side-scrolling platformer, but at a slower pace with more focus on exploration and puzzle elements to juggle different abilities to reach the captured characters, even though there are many enemies present. To complete a level all other blobs need to be freed and then the area can be exited through a door.\n\nAs an amorphous blob, Putty has a number of abilities. He can stretch in the four major directions to reach items or move up platforms. He can also jump and flatten himself completely to avoid enemies. He has different types of attacks that can be upgraded throughout the game, ranging from a simple punch to electrical shocks and darts. Not all available abilities are available right away, they are upgraded or become available by collecting stars in levels. There are different types of items and these can be absorbed to use them at a later date. These are restored in a bar on the right side of the screen where they can be selected. Putty can for instance launch rockets, throw bombs, activate a shield, or call in a pod that provides free movement anywhere in the level for 30 seconds. He is also able to inflate and then use an hot air stream to scale heights, but only for a limited amount of time.\n\nHe has a limited amount of lives and a number of hearts per life. Optionally players can collect all yellow stars in a level. Each level has a time limit and time can be extended by freeing prisoners and collecting clock items. At any moment a map mode can be activated where the game zooms on out to show the entire level. Levels are selected from a global map screen where they are unlocked gradually. The main game mode is called marathon and there is a separate challenge mode for speedruns and other challenges with medals when certain conditions are met. There is also a tutorial available. By playing well players unlock stickers in a sticker book. When all stickers on a single page are unlocked, an additional level becomes available.","Publisher":"System 3","ReleaseDate":"2014-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/5QTS7zihLTQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Putty_Squad#Remake"},"184447":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"RecoLove: Gold Beach"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dingo Inc.","Genres":"Adventure; Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"8731e7db-a7ef-4889-bf9f-6460d34f10bd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"34b880e0-b03e-4e24-8380-bae1ad7affd4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0ed185e5-5f25-43c3-8d9e-8cf6092e875d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea58a66b-c1e2-4ee2-94e2-ddd3e7311231.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"93948834-19e3-421b-9903-0004f134818b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4cf0d472-6732-4e12-ab8d-3ba0eff26909.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bf685b58-b29e-4dfd-a71f-26de1a28f6c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Reco Love: Gold Beach","Overview":"The player-controlled protagonist of the Reco Love is a second-year high school student who attends Mitsumi Academy, a beachside school equipped with a pool and all.

But the memory of the humans is short... wars begin, breaking the world's harmony, and now the world is threatened by seven demons. Emperor Leon of Avalon tries to rid the world of the demons. One day, he goes on a treasure hunt, accompanied by his son and heir, Gerard. But the emperor is slain by a horrible monster, and now Gerard, the child of royal blood, has to continue his work.\n\nIn this game, you control the royal family of Avalon throughout several generations. Unlike the first game, where you could play eight different characters from the very beginning of the game, here you play various characters continuously, generation after generation. Each time the old emperor passes away, you'll have to choose a heir for him out of four candidates. The choice of those candidates depends on chance and on your decisions to recruit party members during your reign. You'll learn various techniques during the game and then assign them to your party members (a party contains five active characters). Characters can die permanently, i.e., become unavailable for the rest of the game, in case they lose their life points; each time a character's HP reaches zero in battle, the character loses one life point.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game was released exclusively in Japan.\n\nThe worldwide release on modern platforms in December 2017 saw the game completely translated in English, with updated graphics and audio, new character classes, a new dungeon and a New Game+ feature.","Publisher":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Romancing_SaGa_2#Remasters"},"184451":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square Enix","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"8c0dcf60-f159-4642-9a8d-c88d44dc20cb.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c8802d73-c1a0-4b99-b706-298ab2a54e24.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7aeb4fd3-d7b4-40f9-8d65-5f0b2edfc90e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2b359293-a6eb-4d8f-87dc-267da71fcfb3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b89be972-0298-4690-bdca-ef6ff58fc9d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"00324131-3b9e-4923-925a-ed6d6e57b9b6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Romancing SaGa 3","Overview":"The celebrated RPG classic comes west for the first time!

The player controls the male character Hue who needs to find back his missing mother. She developed a ring called Annular Spectrum which allows perception and alteration of impossible colours, beyond the human spectrum. She was deceived by the traitorous professor Dr. Grey she fell in love with and has now become invisible, as a shade of such as impossible colour. It is up to Hue to restore the ring and bring her back by collecting the many scattered coloured shards.\n\nThe game consists of a large, 2D side-scrolling world where different environments are linked together through doors. The game uses a silhouetted art style which is initially monochromatic. Soon Hue discovers his first colour, which is added to a ring-like circle that can be summoned at any moment, as one of many bright colours. Eventually eight colours can be collected: aqua, blue, lime, orange, pink, purple, red and yellow. These are used for the main gameplay mechanic as the player can switch between them on the fly, even in the middle of actions as time is slowed down extensively during the selection. Changing a colour brings it into the environment, colouring almost anything. This mechanic is for instance used to discover hidden doors. Obstacles, barriers and other elements often have a specific colour and when Hue switches colours to match it, it disappears into the environment as if it was never there. The simple mechanic quickly becomes more complex due to moving elements, the ability to push and pull objects, platform-based puzzles, fast sequences and so on. While Hue can jump and there are some general elements such as ladders or deadly spikes, almost every area needs to be approached as a puzzle that can be solved without time pressure.","Publisher":"Curve Digital","ReleaseDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"193876":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Novectacle","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"583d23e4-efbe-4301-b6ac-bcebb9e0a635.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"The House in Fata Morgana","Overview":"ou awaken in a decrepit old mansion.\n\nA woman with eyes of jade stands before You, informing You that You are the Master of the house, and she Your Maid.

They were interested in expediting their scientific research, and thus began developing the Universe's \"Greatest Science Experiment\" which was theorized to unlock \"real-time\".

He is also a octopus in a suit who lives unrecognized in the human world. The majority of the time is spent with mundane tasks, e.g. preparing the protagonist's wedding ceremony, but unfortunately one person knows the secret: a crazy chef who is in the mood for sushi...\n\nThis is commercial and further developed successor to the freeware game Octodad. While the objectives themselves are not too complicated, e.g. doing the dishes, the challenge comes from the fact that each limb is controlled separately. Of course this makes coordinated movement hard and, along with the deliberately oversensitive physics simulation, results in chaos and slapstick moments. However, making chaos when other people are watching fills up a suspicion meter which eventually causes Octodad to be recognized and leads to a game over. Sometimes there are small stealth sequences in which the protagonist can't be seen at all.\n\nAfter finishing the campaign, the six levels can be replayed in order to find hidden ties or beating the developers' best time. In co-op mode, each player controls one limb (or two with less than four participants). The level editor is exclusive to the Windows version, but the user levels can also be played on Macintosh and Linux.","Publisher":"Young Horses","ReleaseDate":"2014-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"193947":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Just Add Water","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b12859c6-98fa-4628-9b1e-6c91dc9bca6d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee: New 'n' Tasty!","Overview":"Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is a faithful remake of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee where the pre-rendered sceneries are recreated in real-time 3D without changing the original gameplay.

One such arc is that of The Order of the EZIC Star, a group bent on regime change. The Order will send a hooded messenger to give the immigration inspector commands about how to admit their agents into Arztoska or may even ask him to kill.\n\nThere are a little over thirty ingame days and twenty endings.

The general term for this value, which determines the morality of an individual's heart and soul, is commonly known as the Psycho-Pass.\n\nOne component of this value is the Crime Coefficient, which is ultimately a number that represents an individual's potential to commit crime. In order to combat those who attempt to disrupt the status quo, detectives work in tandem to maintain peace and order, composed of Enforcers and Inspectors. The former is tasked with apprehending suspects, while the latter oversees and commands their subordinate colleagues. After all, Enforcers possess high Crime Coefficients. However, because of their criminal nature, they can better understand what makes other criminals tick, allowing them to sniff out suspects and arrest the true perpetrators. But because of their criminal background, Inspectors are needed to provide a calm and sound judgement to each case. Ultimately, all members of the MWPSB have to walk a fine line, maintaining their own mental health while facing the worst that society has to offer.\n\nWith justice in their hearts, the detectives of Division 1 tackle each case, confronting humanity's ugly truths.\n\nBut, what lies ahead?","Publisher":"5pb.

The player controls a solar craft hovering above the surface and it needs to survive as long as possible, racing after the sun that provides the power to move on. The game world is procedurally generated and changes each day. It is divided into regions with a completely different lay-out each day, but with fixed mutators for each region to build a similar difficulty curve for every session.\n\nTo survive the craft needs to dodge moving and falling blocks, pillars, shapes and projectiles that appear in quick succession. Acceleration is done automatically and it cannot be slowed down. The craft can be steered left and right endlessly, as there is no border to the game world. The quickest way to gain speed is by picking up yellow boost items, slightly reversing the sun path for a while. Green items provide a jump that can be triggered at any moment, allowing the craft to fly. Purple ones provide a second chance after a crash. Obstacles are not the only concern, as tunnels, clouds or objects blacking out the sun also need to be avoided as they deplete the available energy. The game is over when there is no more sunlight or after a crash. Along the way blue tris can be collected, triangles that add up to a score multiplier. When bumping into an obstacle, not causing a complete collision, some speed is lost and the multiplier is reset. The gameplay is fast-paced and requires good reflexes in the later regions. By steering in a certain direction and quickly switching, a barrel roll can be performed.\n\nThe game offers different objectives that can be completed over multiple sessions, such as achieving a certain amount of air time, clearing a region without a single collision, collecting a number of tris, achieving a certain score etc. This allows the craft to level up with a cap at 25. With almost every level some new options become available, such as decals for the ship or attachments. The latter include a magnet that collects nearby pick-ups automatically, a battery to survive longer without energy, storage for multiple jump pick-ups or shields etc. These have an upgraded version as well. It is possible to fit multiple attachments at a certain level and another type of bonus provides a higher multiplier level at the start.\n\nAfter a while a secondary Apocalypse mode is unlocked, set in a different world with a higher difficulty level and meteorites that cause temporary blindness. The game's editor support the creation and sharing of user made levels through the Steam workshop. These can be downloaded and played separately and some are also accessed in the game's main mode through world portals in the game world, temporarily moving the game into a very different environment before continuing. There are global leaderboards to compare scores.\n\nIn February 2015 the unlockable Labyrinthia mode was added. It is an advanced, randomized maze filled with obstacles, switches and moving parts. It largely takes the sun and reflex based movement out of the equation in favour of planning ahead. It uses a more zoomed out view.","Publisher":"Flippfly LLC","ReleaseDate":"2013-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"193961":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EXE-CREATE","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"902b235a-6825-4de5-8608-869ff5e61e90.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Revenant Dogma","Overview":"Where does the path of divine power lead?

The player is the lone survivor of a space train that got shot out of orbit and crash landed on a mysterious planet.\n\nEach stage starts with the player spawning in a random spot. The first aim is to find a teleporter, also randomly spawned somewhere in that stage. When the teleporter is found and activated, it will take 90 seconds to be fully active. During this time, several enemies will spawn, including a boss. After the teleporter loading time is complete, the player must then kill all enemies that are left in order to be teleported to the next stage.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the game is that difficulty increases over time: a difficulty bar is shown in the top right corner of the screen. Every five minutes the difficulty increases one level, so the quicker the player finds his way out of stages, the easier the later stages are. In order to keep up with the challenge, the players must equip their characters with items that were being carried by the space train. There are more than 100 different items (most of which must be unlocked), each with a different effect, such as inflicting damage to enemies as they approach the player, increasing healing rate, slowing down hit enemies, double jump, etc. The effects are stackable, so if two or more items of the same kind are collected a multiplier will be added to it. Items are dropped by boss enemies, but are more commonly found in locked chests. To unlock chests, players must collect money dropped by enemies when killed. Money is also used to activate drones that will help the player.\n\nPlayers can choose different characters, each one with different skills. Every character has 4 different actions, like different weapons or defensive maneuvers, plus one usable item slot. There are 12 different characters available, but they must be unlocked by finding items or performing some achievements.","Publisher":"Hopoo Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"193965":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tikipod","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"83c92a2d-4477-4c94-a52b-4cd1f098da19.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Rock Boshers DX: Director's Cut","Overview":"Get ready to take a trip back to the 80s, the 1880s!\nHelp young Queen Victoria fight her way across Mars and attempt to escape home in this exceedingly retro arcade adventure!\nCreated to look, feel and sound like an 8-bit styled videogame from the 1980s - Rock Boshers DX: Director’s Cut mixes top down and side on 8-way directional shooting action.\n\nSee amazing sights as you journey across Mars.

The game has a bright visual style inspired by 50's art and corresponding music, and uses a lot of B-movie-inspired humor with many references to other indie games in the background environment.\n\nThe blob can move left and right and jump. While in the air a dash can be performed to quickly move down, also to destroy objects below. Levels are usually split up in smaller sections with multiple checkpoints, locked through a cork. In order to pass, the blob needs to absorbs various objects along the way to grow to the required size. Similar to the Katamari games certain items can only be absorbed when a certain size has been reached. As a blob it is also able to squeeze through narrow passages.\n\nVarious gameplay elements are introduced gradually. Through telekinesis certain objects such as platforms can be moved. In sections with magnetism it is possible to stick to magnetic surfaces or repel from them by changing polarity, gaining boost. There are also sections where the blob can be moved freely around the environment, boosting around in any direction with a more powerful boost to gain speed. Next to the main levels various mini-game levels can be unlocked where courses need to be completed. Depending on the objects sometimes multiple hits can be taken and health is recharged at the next checkpoint. Various small blue orbs can be eaten to reach a high score, tracked on global leaderboards. Blob friends are hidden in each level where they can be freed.","Publisher":"Drinkbox Studios","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"194011":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rain Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"9586ea6d-13f7-4d7d-9353-384abb58ae62.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Teslagrad","Overview":"Teslagrad is a side-scrolling platformer with strong puzzle elements. The protagonist is a boy who finds himself inside the mysterious Tesla Tower which houses fictional technology inspired by the works of inventor Nikola Tesla. The game communicates without words.\n\nThe player moves inside the tower which can be freely explored (but, as it is a tower, the general direction is up and there are not many branches in width). To progress, the player needs to use special abilities to solve puzzles which are all based on magnetic fields: many objects have a magnetic field (red or blue); objects with different colours are attracted to each other while objects of the same colour are repelled. The player has gloves which allow him to change the polarity of objects. During the course of the games, more abilities and gadgets are earned, e.g. a cannon to change polarity over distances or a short-distance teleport to pass deadly currency unharmed. Those are used to reach new parts of the tower. The puzzles are mostly embedded in platforming challenges which require pixel-perfect jumping and fast reactions. There are also a few boss battles.","Publisher":"SOEDESCO","ReleaseDate":"2015-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"194014":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Omega Force","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b6e3523c-3a9a-43c8-afd0-433c6f4ec208.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Toukiden 2","Overview":"Slayers!

It is set in London in 1849 and the player takes control of a master burglar. In 100 days Scotland Yard will activate The Devil's Basilisk, advanced artificial intelligence technology that will massively improve surveillance and make theft almost impossible. Therefore the thief has 100 days to steal the Basilisk and prevent it from being activated.\n\nThe master burglar is never seen in the game and does not take part in the action. Instead he sends out lower thieves to perform heists. A thief is sent down from an airship, the main hub, using a pod. When the heist is successful the thief can return to the airship with the haul where the money can be spent in five skill trees: agility, abilities, tools, goggles and miscellaneous. The game consists of six main locations that are randomly generated for level design, enemies and items with each new heist. By earning money the main goal is to buy additional security clearance, opening up new locations, until the Basilisk can be stolen in the final location to win the game. The six main locations are The Slums, Warehouse District, New Belgravia, Casino Town, The Banks, and The Swindle. Each started heist, whether successful or not, takes up a single day. The game is lost if the Basilisk is not stolen in 100 days because the game ends after that limit. Each new location provides opportunities to steal a lot more money, but also introduces more difficulty security and more dangerous guards. That way the game challenges the player to take calculated risks. By saving up it is possible to move on to harder locations quickly, but the money can also be spent on various perks that make the heists easier instead. The thief characters can die or be terminated and a random one is then generated for each new heist after an unsuccessful one. The player is however encouraged to carry on with a single character as an experience bonus is provided for completing consecutive heists with the same thief. Bonus are also provided for completing levels without being spotted (ghost) and rewarding aptitude.\n\nEach heist takes place in a side-scrolling, fairly small area with connected rooms. There are various approaches through doors, climbing pipes, creating entrances with bombs or smashing windows. The character can move around and jump. By upgrading elements in the agility skill tree additional options can be unlocked and often be upgraded multiple times, such as wall jumping and clinging to walls, double jumping and stealth. Most early enemies have a line of sight that is visible to the player, but from New Belgravia onwards enemies with a microphone icon are sensitive to sound and then the slower sneaking method has to be used for movement. Enemies can be taken out by whacking them. Some enemies require multiple hits and others cannot be destroyed permanently with the regular weapon. Unlockable abilities include a hacking skill to disarm bombs, open doors and open cash machines. This is done through a short mini-game where the player has to follow the directions on the screen to press one of four directions, sometimes multiple times. When a mistake is made while disarming a bomb, it explodes right away, killing the thief. Other abilities are bionic eyes, improved hacking, barging through doors and so on. Many different tools can also be unlocked that can be selected during heists. They are bombs to blow through walls, steam purge to use a cloud that obscures vision, bugs that syphon funds, EMPs and so on. Many of these have a limit or use a separate meter that takes some time to recharge. It is possible to switch between tools at any time during a level and they are all available when unlocked. There are also four types of goggles to unlock and other technology such as jamming radio transmissions or improvements for tools and abilities.\n\nWhen a thief is killed, no money is gathered from that heist and a new one needs to be sent out. All levels offer multiple approaches through the tools and abilities. Doors can be opened or closed, many elements can be hacked and custom passages can be created with bombs. Each location introduces new elements to levels and new types of enemies that need to be analyzed. When the thief is spotted, the alarms are sounded right away. All enemies then become much faster and more aggressive. The funds in the levels are then also drained gradually to move them elsewhere. The thief can however still finish the level by returning to the pod, but has to watch out for a powerful police character that soon arrives. It has some roguelike elements (character permadeath, random levels), but perks are permanent and carried over to a new thief as long as there are days left. Perks are also bought specifically and are not offered from a random selection.","Publisher":"Curve Digital","ReleaseDate":"2015-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"194017":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data East Corporation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e59c6d20-2d71-48c5-88ef-0a090b8ba564.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Windjammers","Overview":"Windjammers is based on a real-life sport known as Saucer Tennis or Frisbee Tennis. You and an opponent face off in an arena with a low net in the middle. Points are scored by throwing a disc into the goals behind a player or whenever your opponent is not able to catch the disc in time. There are two moves: a regular throw and a lob. By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly.\n\nThere are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds. The game is won after two winning sets or sudden death after two draws.\n\nFor the futuristic touch, signature moves are added. To charge these special moves, you need to block, toss or lob the disc and then charge while the disc is in the air. These moves can be countered and sometimes they knock an opponent into the goal.\n\nTwo mini-games are included in-between levels: play fetch with a dog and Flying Disc Bowling.","Publisher":"DotEmu","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"194018":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Diabolical Mind","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"8392804e-dab4-4fea-8909-9d5d13f16cea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Project Xenon Valkyrie+","Overview":"Xenon Valkyrie is a roguelite platformer game with RPG elements in which you must fight to the deepest part of a moon and halt the plans of a wicked witch.\n\nObtain many weapons as you fight through a unique, randomly-generated world every time you play.
