There is no Robot Hitler like in the original game, but now a pirate captain called Greatbeard who has captured all the animals the ninja protects and has turned them into robots. This, along with some other references, is a nod to Doctor Robotnik from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.\n\nWhile ten seconds is the minimum amount of time, players are encouraged to complete levels much quicker. This is to compete against other players on worldwide leaderboards, but also to earn up to three stars needed to unlock new sets of levels. The basic controls remain identical. The ninja can move left or right, (double) jump, attack with a sword and throw up to three shuriken per level. Greatbeard's zeppelin acts as a hub where different sets of levels can be accessed. The game has about 100 levels including the 40 levels of the original 10 Second Ninja remastered for this edition. Levels often have obstacles such as spikes and are meant to be played many times in succession to try different strategies and get faster times.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Four Circle Interactive","Publisher":"Curve Digital","ReleaseDate":"2016-07-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202384,"FileName":"e413c6dc-2f93-44f8-a589-dd471b37f212.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202384,"FileName":"55daf460-2794-4d70-a894-f256bec12206.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26735,"Name":"1001 Spikes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1001 Spikes is a platform game developed and published by Nicalis.

The boy can feed the blob a variety of jelly beans, which are unlocked as the game progresses and vary depending on the level, which transforms it into one of fifteen different objects that can be used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. These include ladders for climbing, anvils to drop on top of enemies, holes that allow the boy to drop through platforms, and cannons for shooting to the difficult-to-reach areas. Unlike the original NES game, which only displayed each jelly bean's flavor, this version allows players to select beans from a wheel that shows what each bean does. The boy can also hug and scold the blob, as well as call to it to revert its transformation and bring it to his side. However, the boy will die if he touches an enemy or a hazardous object, or falls from a great height, sending the player back to the beginning of the area. The game is split into four worlds, each containing ten levels and a boss battle.

One day she finds a speaking book which bears not only the soul of the alchemist Platcha, but also promises of a powerful alchemy item. Unfortunately the book suffers from amnesia which has to be countered by adding new alchemy recipes.\n\nThe biggest change in comparison to the earlier part of the series is the removal of the time limits (except for a few side quests). To gain recipes and progress in the plot, Sophie simply has to follow her ideas (basically hints for what to do next), e.g. visiting a location, defeating a monster or talking to someone. Time still plays an important part because the night/day cycle, day of the week and weather influences the behaviour of the town people and which ingredients/enemies can be found in the game world.\n\nThose are required for using the alchemy system, as usually the heart of the game. After activating a cauldron, it is represented with a grid as well as colored orbs. An item is created by putting ingredients, which have a shape and a colour. All those properties interact with each other, for example when two ingredients overlap, the impact of the underlying one is lost and the placement of orbs in relation to the orbs (if they are near of overlap) influences the outcome. There are also different cauldrons which have special impacts on the process, e.g. one makes especially powerful items but has a time limit.\n\nWhen exploring the areas, Sophie and her party (up to four people overall) will encounter monsters to fight. Then the game switches to a round-based system where the player gives order like attacking, defending, using items or using abilities. The new stance system replaces the previous support system: each character has offensive and defensive stances which can be chosen instead of a regular command. Then the character automatically uses an appropriate action when their turn comes. This powers up the chain meter; the higher the more effective the actions become. When multiple characters have their meter up, a very powerful special attack which drains the meter is performed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Gust","Publisher":"Koei Tecmo Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181167,"FileName":"0b820265-f26e-4b9c-943e-26cf171bfa9e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181167,"FileName":"7a0cfe5f-f56b-4200-a005-986c92dfc362.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":181167,"AlternateName":"Sophie no Atelier: Fushigi na Hon no Renkinjutsushi","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":19148,"Name":"Atelier Totori Plus: The Adventurer of Arland","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Totori brings her tools, her books and everything colourful to the PS Vita.

The result is an artistic dream world that is recognizable, yet totally different from the real world, where many things are not what they seem and dangers to the sleepwalker lurks deeper in.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kAUHodxfak","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Bedtime Digital Games","Publisher":"Bedtime Digital Games","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202426,"FileName":"09d4dcb6-ecc8-4362-a93d-45b049df5a5c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202426,"FileName":"2c625408-6e29-4563-9463-f8d015e35ce0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202427,"Name":"Backgammon Blitz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Backgammon's back... with a bang!

It's the story of a city known as Caelondia after it has been destroyed by a disaster called \"Calamity\". The game follows a silent protagonist known as \"The Kid\" who tries to create a safe haven (Bastion) with the help of Rucks, who is also the narrator of the game. The kid has to defeat the game's many foes with a variety of melee and ranged weapons and also special skills. The Bastion, which acts as some sort of headquarters in the game, can be upgraded with useful buildings as the player progresses.\n\nAs the Kid travels through the world, he will discover new weapons, upgrade materials, mementos and fragments. Mementos can be discussed with other characters residing in the Bastion and may reveal more about the world. The Kid can only hold two weapons and one special skill at a time, which may require switching them with others, considering the player's preferences and the enemies' weaknesses. The fragments are the game's main currency and they can be collected after destroying objects, defeating enemies and, sometimes, by simply finding them. The player can later use them in the Bastion in order to purchase upgrades and useful trinkets.\n\nThe Bastion encloses a total of six buildings which the Kid can restore and utilize. In the Distillery, the player can assign spirits (drinks) to a maximum of ten slots, providing various passive bonuses during the gameplay. At the beginning, only one slot is available for use, the rest being unlocked one by one every time the Kid levels up. The Arsenal stores all the weapons that the protagonist gathers during his adventures; the player can switch weapons and special skills here. The weapons are enhanced and upgraded in the Forge, and this is possible only after collecting the required upgrade materials in the world. The Memorial offers various challenges, which if completed reward the player with additional fragments. In Lost-and-Found, the player can spend fragments in order to restore upgrade materials and unlock idols and spirits. Finally, the game difficulty can be increased by invoking the gods in the Shrine.\n\nOne of the notable features in the game is dynamic narration. Narrating in the game is based on the player's actions. For example, when the kid has fallen from a height the narrator gives a comment about the incident.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Supergiant Games","Publisher":"Limited Run Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":29818,"FileName":"a93adde9-ea41-4530-906b-f5358db7d01e.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":29818,"FileName":"dbd488ea-888f-451c-b182-018b4f04522a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19963,"Name":"Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate is a 2.5D action game set three months after the events of Batman: Arkham Origins. Batman catches Catwoman as she attempts to steal from an enterprise and during the encounter they are interrupted by security guards who do not want Batman to interfere. After a chase that also acts as the tutorial, he learns from Catwoman that the Arkham Blackgate prison has been taken over by Black Mask, Joker and Penguin. They each control a different part of the prison (the industrial complex, administration and cell blocks respectively) and have taken hostages. Batman ventures inside to restore order and he can choose which area to tackle first.\n\nThe game is played on a 2D plane, but with the option to move up and down as well. There are also many sequences, for instance when using the grappling hook combined with different camera perspectives, that Batman seemingly moves around as with full 3D movement and many rooms also have multiple vantage points. The game borrows many mechanics from the main games in the series. During combat Batman can punch, kick, counter, evade and string together combos. The grappling hook is used to move around quickly. He can also run, jump, hang from ledges (and do takedowns from there) and shimmy. By touching and holding the screen an analyzer is activated to scan the area. This can highlight objects important to progress and Batman can for instance interact with them by throwing the batarang. A detective mode is activated to highlight objects in yellow and enemies in red by swiping (Vita) or using the circle pad (3DS). In this mode clues can also be revealed to solve side mysteries and sometimes it is the only way to get access to additional WayneTech. Batman can switch between targets, keep track of them, and for instance attack from the air with a glide kick.\n\nBorrowing elements from the metroidvania genre, the game requires backtracking to open up new routes when certain items have been found, such as an explosive gel or the batclaw, in additional to the batarang provided at the start of the game. There are small amount of stealth, but usually as a means of environment based puzzle solving (i.e. not getting killed instantly) instead of an alternative approach. Batman can for instance rappel up to the rafters or hide in sewer gates. There are one-on-one bossfights and these rely heavily on quick time events. There are also enemies not present in the main Origins game, such as Catwoman and Bronze Tiger. Cut-scenes are shown as still, drawn images with voiceovers and minor animations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLxmeIPITjA","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"Armature Studio","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

The game is divided into 12 main episodes, an epilogue, and 3 additional episodes that focus on side characters. Gameplay itself is split between the simulation segments in which the player interacts with Ion and develops their friendship, and visual novel segments that explore Ion's memories.\n\nIon is an amnesiac girl who lives in a sealed world, where her only companion is a shopkeeper named Nelico. One day, a strange terminal appears in her room, and though she cannot receive any sound or visuals through it, it does give her a mental connection to the person on the other side. The player is that person, and their Playstation Vita is the tool they use to communicate with Ion. Though she lives on her own schedule and may not always be available to talk to, the more the game is played, the more Ion will try to synchronize her schedule with the player's. The player is able to talk to Ion, ask her to synthesize new items such as clothes, go on dates with her, and dive into her dream world to try recovering her lost memories.\n\nIon's dream world is heavily damaged, and the player must fix it by using the PS Vita's camera to read bar codes from the real world. Scanned bar codes will create fairy-like creatures called Sharls, which will then work to repair the damaged memories once the player has spent Hymmno Points to make a pact with them. The most efficient way to earn Hymmno Points is through online play, and other online options also exist that allow players to communicate with one another and interact with each others' Sharls.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Gust Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2012-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182571,"FileName":"48643053-ccd2-4e13-b3a3-60e723f92b5f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182571,"FileName":"7f5ca588-8d02-4a32-be6d-8046d393e529.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182571,"FileName":"13b5d5f3-ade7-4377-8b54-dd8670c00084.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182571,"FileName":"f1178608-8bf1-478b-b96b-78aaafaf8b54.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182571,"FileName":"c0e9c0c7-3bfb-4992-b6cd-d55d4ec0cae0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182571,"FileName":"4fbd79d1-2300-4430-9f5d-e6de99262a0c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30835,"Name":"Citizens of Earth","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Citizens of Earth is a role-playing video game developed by Eden Industries and published by Atlus for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Eden Industries","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30835,"FileName":"4fdf4450-0060-4373-8ba6-6b5bf72ddbf4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30835,"FileName":"662e3010-6d81-4827-8991-ca0ac1577c7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202364,"Name":"Cladun Returns: This is Sengoku!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Set in Japan's Sengoku Era, you find yourself in the mysterious land of Arcanus Cella.

While it has classic elements such as exploring, gathering loot and defeating enemies, the entire gameplay is based around the concept of a rhythm game. Using the game's soundtrack or custom music, all the actions become much more effective when they are matched to the music's beat. The basic controls consist of four keys or buttons for movement, but optionally even a dance pad is supported. These move the character around and attack when next to a creature. Enemies move and attack according to the beat as well and they each have unique patterns that need to be identified. Moving ahead of the beat is not possible and while the opposite (skipping a beat or not reacting) is allowed, it takes away a coin multiplier bonus that is important to collect the basic currency. That way the character always need to move or attack and in that way it resembles a very fast version of a turn-based game where turns are executed simultaneously for both the character and enemies. Often, the song also acts as a time limit and when the song is over the character is taken immediately to the next level, leaving the rewards of the current level behind. Movement is only horizontal and vertical, not diagonal.\n\nTypical roguelike elements include permadeath, randomized environments, and weapons and items that are often different for each session. Next to the basic coins currency used in a single session to buy items at a shopkeeper, diamonds are a second currency that are gathered across sessions and can be spent at the lobby to access permanent perks. There are many different characters to unlock, each with their own abilities, different zones and multiple game modes. Typical weapons include a broadsword with a long reach, a throwable dagger, bombs, and a shovel to bust through walls quickly. After defeating a certain enemy, often a boss, the exit stairs are unlocked to move to a new level. Often there are optional challenges, for instance to find or buy a key to free someone from a cage, or rewards in exchange for more difficult levels. The game has many types of items and abilities for the main character. The character has a number of hearts, representing health.\n\nThe PC version has a level editor with integration through Steam Workshop to create and share new levels. The game has a daily challenge with an identical dungeon for all players and supports local cooperative games with a second player on the same screen. There is a story mode and a basic run of the game consists of four zones with four levels each. The story describes how Cadence, the initial character and the daughter of a famous treasure hunter, has gone missing after she ends up in the crypt of the NecroDancer. He steals her heart (which is used to represent the beat at the bottom of the screen) and she needs to defeat him and his minions, while keeping her heart pumping.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Brace Yourself Games","Publisher":"Brace Yourself Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202531,"FileName":"d5fcb9ba-fbea-43f9-a898-d2be58858c0a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202531,"FileName":"27186363-12c7-4403-a106-f4a8aff8b3cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202532,"Name":"Crypto by POWGI","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Crack the code to reveal the quote in this classic cryptogram puzzle.\n\nDecrypt the ciphers to find 180 funny and inspirational messages.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Lightwood Games","Publisher":"Lightwood Games","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202532,"FileName":"3e09f1e3-9170-49e0-9ddc-ae93c18a40bb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193795,"Name":"Curses N' Chaos","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this 2D Arena-Brawler world, there is only one law: fight or die!

Black circles called notes appear on the screen as the song plays, and must be interacted with when the scan line passes over them. Depending on the type of note, they may need to be tapped, dragged, or held. Hitting notes with good timing and building up a combo increases the player's score, which is then used to calculate their rank.\n\nSongs are divided into sets called chapters, each of which tells a story. The first ten chapters, I through X, form the main plot of Cytus. They tell the story of a future in the 22nd century in which humanity has been wiped out by a virus. In an attempt to preserve something of themselves, humans uploaded their memories into robot bodies; however, technological limitations necessitated a separate storage system for emotions. The memory storage system, Cytus, allows robots to access their human emotions in the form of music. The story follows a robot named Vanessa as she comes to terms with her new life and identity as a robot.\n\nSeveral chapters exist outside the main story, most of which need to be unlocked through in-app purchases.

It is set in the same universe as Eternity's Child and it is very similar to the earlier titles Mecho Wars and the remake Mecho Wars HD by the same development team and many characters from those games return. Just like in Mecho Wars two factions known as Winged Crusade and Landians fight over land and resources. The single-player campaign is split up in three episodes with multiple levels each, in-game story sequences with events and conversations between characters.\n\nThe turn-based battles combine fights with resource management. Different types of buildings such as factories and cities can be captured by infantry. Once captured, they generate an amount of gold per turn that can be used at those locations to train new units. They are divided into four types: infantry, heavy, air and water with multiple units per type. They each have a cost and different statistics based on movement, attack range, an offensive bonus against certain types and a weakness against certain types. Slower and heavy units can often attack from a distance and take a lot of damage, but movement is slow and they are weak against certain types. During a turn the player can move units, train new ones, capture buildings and attack. For movement a green grid shows the available options.\n\nThere terrain also influences the gameplay. A road and a bridge lower the defenses, but improves movement, while a mountain extends the attack range. There are flying units that can travel anywhere and water units that can cross large gaps and attack from a distance. Cacti are used to replenish health. The game uses a day-and-night system with an hour per turn. At night, water freezes and units have the ability to travel over the ice. In the story campaign there are different win conditions, but usually opponents need to be defeated and buildings need to be captured. Once captured they change colour, but the opponent can also retake them. Buildings can only be captured by fast, but weak infantry units. Battles are shown in a separate screen with a side view and are executed automatically. The attack is shown as well as the damage done to the opposition, with two large health bars near the top. Before attacking a percentage of success is shown at the targeted unit. A single unit almost always represents a larger group and some creatures have the ability to retaliate right away.\n\nIn the skirmish game mode custom battles in all levels are available. They are played as games of Conquest (capture all H.Q. structures) or Annihilation (defeat all enemies). Online multiplayer is supported with an additional game type, Assassination, where a specific, marked creature needs to be defeated to win the game. For multiplayer games a turn time can be defined as 5 or 20 minutes, or 8 or 24 hours. Multiple games can be played at the same time, in both single-player and multiplayer and these can be accessed right away from a menu by clicking a snapshot of the area. The game also includes unlockable perks to customize the armies.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/pYM54W4tXN8","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Luc Bernard","Publisher":"Nine Tales Digital","ReleaseDate":"2015-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33890,"FileName":"a5015fa4-742a-4231-bcc1-46c8ed116688.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33890,"FileName":"4ede1675-371d-4a82-891a-57c644c91db1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32480,"Name":"Destiny of Spirits","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Destiny of Spirits is a free-to-play, location-based, social strategy game for the PlayStation Vita.

The game is a third-person 3D shooter featuring fights with floods of large enemies on gigantic, sprawling maps.\n\nThe game's story, which seems to be a re-telling of Monster Attack as it is set in 2017 (Global Defence Force takes place in 2019 and indicates that Monster Attack occurred two years earlier), places the player in the role of an EDF infantry man tasked with defending the Earth from hordes of alien invaders. The game features 53 missions where you fight against aliens on city streets, in underground caves and on coastal zones. You have access to 170 weapons divided into 7 categories including assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, grenades and more.\n\nYou unlock new weapons throughout the game by picking up Weapon objects, dropped by killed enemies. Weapon objects provide you random weapons including those the character already has. On some maps there are also helicopters, battlemechs, tanks and bikes that can be controlled.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version features 2-player split-screen multiplayer where you can play cooperative or versus battle. The PS Vita version has an online cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players.\n\nEarth Defense Force 2017 is the first game in the series that features AI controlled EDF forces on its maps; in both previous games, the player fought completely by themselves, despite supposedly being in an army. Unlike Global Defence Force, the radio chatter from the Japanese version was retained for the English release.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqQ2JOGn8xM","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Sandlot","Publisher":"D3 Publisher Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-01-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14350,"FileName":"445403ff-d1ca-4bef-8487-039591a7bf3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":101800,"Name":"Ecolibrium","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bring harmony to a virtual ecosystem in this PS Vita gaming app.\n \n- Create a balanced ecosystem by choosing different combinations of species, plants and artefacts.\n \n- Acquire, collect and trade new plants and animals with other PS Vita owners.\n\n- Collect new creatures using the GPS feature of the PS Vita 3G model and show them off to your friends on Facebook.\n\n- Release unwanted creatures into the wild for other players to pick up using \"near\".\n\n- Unlock new content by completing challenges.\n\n- Download Ecolibrium for free from PlayStation Store.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grv3A5lGMEY","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"SCEE","Publisher":"SCEA","ReleaseDate":"2013-02-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":101800,"FileName":"bb37d72f-3e8b-497a-b7a5-7bef13218279.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":101800,"FileName":"a361f408-3943-468e-af83-594845784585.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183922,"Name":"Eiyuu Senki: The World Conquest","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Eiyuu Senki - The World Conquest, the player finds himself in an alternate world populated with famous characters in history and legend - who all happen to be beautiful women - and must fight his way to world domination.\n\nGame features:\n-70+ Stunning heroines to lead your armies and quest\n-120+ Cities to conquer\n-Tactical Turn based battles with numerous skills, items and enemies to master\n-Fully Japanese voices with over 50 famous voice actors\n-Gorgeous Illustrations of Oyari Ashito and other industry stars","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/4DUf9a3hkH4","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Tenco","Publisher":"5pb","ReleaseDate":"2014-05-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183922,"FileName":"5dae2e12-80bf-4cda-b5bc-cbb99d0125c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183922,"FileName":"d8c440fc-c0da-43bc-bbc3-b6fe6f13a383.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183922,"FileName":"4b176580-ddb0-4396-9ce3-f2b3911ea504.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183922,"FileName":"8155f3af-10b4-4318-b5f5-8c4e81a85fba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183922,"FileName":"ef6d9da9-30d5-4745-bf65-67ffc29ddc55.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183922,"FileName":"978ac0c2-4465-4860-a440-63d56a1f6173.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183922,"AlternateName":" Eiyuu*Senki","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":202707,"Name":"Element4l","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Element4l is an immersive and experimental indie platform game, with a strong focus on flow and smooth gameplay, wrapped in an exceptional soundtrack by Mind Tree. \n\nIn Element4l, you control four elements who are bound together on a journey to shape life.

Just like the first game it is a platformer and the story picks up after the events of the first game. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and the other characters from the Wasteland start rebuilding their world, when it is threatened by a series of earthquake. The Mad Doctor (always speaking in song) and Oswald team up, and Mickey Mouse, the protagonist of the original game, is brought back in the Wasteland world by Gus, the leader of the Gremlins, and Ortensia, Oswald's girlfriend.\n\nIn contrast to the first game, here Oswald and the Mad Doctor are on Mickey's side. Even more, Oswald becomes a support character for Mickey, as referenced in the title. He is either controlled by the computer or entirely by a different player. The game also supports a drop-in, drop-out system for the second player. As in the first game Mickey's most important way to interact with the environment is through paint and thinner with a reticule controlled separately. Thinner is used to rub out pieces in the environment, while paint can restore parts of the scenery. Paint can also be used to befriend or attack characters. Oswald attacks with a boomerang (using his arms) for ranged combat. He also has a remote control used to zap enemies or to charge items in the environments, and can take off his legs. In addition he can spin his ears to hover in the air and lift Mickey over gaps. He can also revive Mickey and be brought back close again with a group button. In many sequences the two need to work together to solve puzzles. For instance Mickey can drag fireworks to a specific spot and then have Oswald ignite it.\n\nThere are many different environments, such as a Western gulch, a spooky bog and the 1950s-style Autotopia. Next to the movement-based controls for the Wii and Wii U, the PlayStation Move peripheral is supported, but not Kinect for the 360 version. For the Wii U version the GamePad can display the map with hotkeys to zoom in or see the location of objectives. Off-TV play is not supported, as it uses regular split-screen for local co-op.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Platform","Developer":"Junction Point Studios, Inc.","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-06-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23493,"FileName":"add14ed4-88b8-40a6-96c6-1152c0c05ef0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23493,"FileName":"ddcdc6ff-cdd2-4a3a-a76d-85098844a54f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23493,"FileName":"65ddc7ac-4bd3-4f5e-abf4-898fcee4f4d7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23493,"FileName":"78218934-7dda-4861-b34b-1f48d1d42383.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23493,"FileName":"61f1a71a-8de0-4535-8f66-4cbf0a1de29c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23493,"FileName":"1c5e05bc-065f-4e07-becb-7a95c152238f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":23493,"AlternateName":"Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":202950,"Name":"Epic Word Search Collection","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Epic Word Search puzzles are huge!\n\nEach puzzle contains over 1,500 words, hidden in a grid that's much too large to fit on screen!\n\nTo solve the word search you'll have to scroll around the puzzle looking for words.

However, something goes wrong, the great Cube explodes, and Gomez wakes up in his room now able to traverse this mysterious third dimension. He is greeted by a curious entity named Dot, who claims to be his guide, telling Gomez that it's up to him to find all the pieces of the Cube, and restore the world before the very fabric of existence collapses.\n\nFez is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer with a twist: the world exists in 3D space, but is always viewed as a 2D plane. The player can switch the perspective at any time between four different views; in a similar manner to Crush or Super Paper Mario, Gomez traverses the world as he sees it. Two platforms may be quite far apart, but suddenly appear right next to each other when viewed from the proper direction. Similarly, a hazard may be blocking Gomez' path, but when rotated out of view, it will no longer harm him.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find the 32 Cubes -- some whole, some broken in to eight smaller \"Cube Bits\".

This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more.\n\nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you.\n\nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self.\n\nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going.\n\nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out.\n\nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils.\n\nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness.\n\nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve.\n\nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better.\n\nSeems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in.\n\nThat's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.\n\nThis description was compiled from the following reviews:\n\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review\n\nhttp://www.pspminis.com/8859/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here/","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter; Strategy","Developer":"Dakko Dakko","Publisher":"Dakko Dakko","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":26981,"FileName":"3e8be512-1824-453f-9061-509056ad767a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202959,"Name":"flOw","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"flOw is a game about piloting an aquatic organism through a surreal biosphere where players consume other organisms, evolve, and dive into the abyss.

At a certain point Oyeatia learns the ability to temporarily transform (beheaded, with a bleeding stump where his head was) and attack enemies with an endless amount of bullets. Activating the form is often optional through an object in the environment. In the \"fighting\" form it is often not possible to activate switches and solve certain puzzles. When dead, the character respawns at the beginning of the level. He has but a single life, so every hit leads to a restart.\n\nThere is a strong focus on sound to enhance the atmosphere, and in the opening scenes the author suggests to play the game with low lighting and minimal external distraction.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30044,"FileName":"ac50cd69-25d1-4a1e-aa50-385abeb3adb9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203001,"Name":"Habroxia","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Lillymo Games","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2019-09-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203001,"FileName":"735a5d5e-9db7-4ca9-ac1d-e4a9b134018b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203001,"FileName":"b21c83ca-d6f0-4f46-8d40-627f1e17df08.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193872,"Name":"Hakuoki: Edo Blossoms","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This remastered telling of the beloved visual novel Hakuoki series is a continuation of the Hakuoki™: Kyoto Winds story and focuses on the story set in Edo, the second part in this two-part series.

The story is tied directly to the first game and is set between 1985 and 1991, but with an anachronistic order. While the first game offered only two playable characters with each one tied to specific parts of the game, the sequel offers a larger playable cast. Each level offers a single character or a small selection to choose from and each character offers a distinct perspective of the events. The character selection is similar to the use of masks in the first game. Each character has a specific set of abilities and perks, such as a faster speed, the ability to dodge roll, dual weapons, melee weapons only, Alex and Ash Davis as twins who use a chainsaw and guns and one is invincible as long as the other is alive, faster aiming, a silenced pistol, executions with firearms etc. Some characters allow the player to choose from different skillsets or weapons.\n\nJust like the original game the gameplay is fast and a single attack is often lethal, meaning levels are meant to be replayed multiple times until all enemy patterns are figured out. Levels have specific objectives and in most of them all enemies need to be killed. Short scenes between the missions further the story. Enemies downed with melee attacks need to be executed to prevent them from coming back, players have to take into account a line of sight through windows, also to avoid snipers, various weapons can be picked up and thrown etc. It is still possible to slightly view ahead to anticipate. Unlike the original game there are now two difficulty levels. 'Hard' is unlocked after completing the campaign on 'normal'. Enemies become harder to defeat and certain abilities, such as enemy locking, are removed. The game includes a level editor made available some time after the release. It can be used not only to create levels, but also cutscenes with dialog.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/g7ZaK3nf2_E","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Dennaton Games","Publisher":"Devolver Digital, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184429,"FileName":"e9c6958a-8ed7-486a-8094-04c2b42110e5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":184429,"FileName":"de546d3e-7211-4ab2-8dab-dada0a50c8a2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184429,"FileName":"cc84b92c-dfc7-47a6-81f5-2e7b7f3290eb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184429,"FileName":"0674f63d-cc03-42b2-84ca-45d8f6389389.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184429,"FileName":"85fdb14d-64d1-43b7-9b91-3f4b014f41eb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25104,"Name":"hToL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the depths of a labyrinthine ruin, a young girl named Mion rises from a deep sleep.

The player controls the male character Hue who needs to find back his missing mother. She developed a ring called Annular Spectrum which allows perception and alteration of impossible colours, beyond the human spectrum. She was deceived by the traitorous professor Dr. Grey she fell in love with and has now become invisible, as a shade of such as impossible colour. It is up to Hue to restore the ring and bring her back by collecting the many scattered coloured shards.\n\nThe game consists of a large, 2D side-scrolling world where different environments are linked together through doors. The game uses a silhouetted art style which is initially monochromatic. Soon Hue discovers his first colour, which is added to a ring-like circle that can be summoned at any moment, as one of many bright colours. Eventually eight colours can be collected: aqua, blue, lime, orange, pink, purple, red and yellow. These are used for the main gameplay mechanic as the player can switch between them on the fly, even in the middle of actions as time is slowed down extensively during the selection. Changing a colour brings it into the environment, colouring almost anything. This mechanic is for instance used to discover hidden doors. Obstacles, barriers and other elements often have a specific colour and when Hue switches colours to match it, it disappears into the environment as if it was never there. The simple mechanic quickly becomes more complex due to moving elements, the ability to push and pull objects, platform-based puzzles, fast sequences and so on. While Hue can jump and there are some general elements such as ladders or deadly spikes, almost every area needs to be approached as a puzzle that can be solved without time pressure.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Fiddlesticks","Publisher":"Curve Digital","ReleaseDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193875,"FileName":"954b3798-0764-4214-9d84-145d20a80563.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202942,"Name":"Hustle Kings","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hustle Kings is a pool game for the Next Generation Portable that utilizes the touch screen and rear touch pad.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"VooFoo Studios","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202942,"FileName":"f34d4b8a-3d24-47d7-a77e-0296b5eff1ac.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202942,"FileName":"741aaee7-5efe-4731-a764-e935cd5e4399.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24886,"Name":"Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hyper devotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart, the very first strategy RPG in the Hyper dimension Neptunia series.

The game was developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. It was released in April 2013 in North America, Europe, and Australia, and June 2013 in Japan. An expanded version of the game, titled Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition, was released in November 2013 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. A free-to-play mobile app based on Injustice was also released for Android and iOS devices.\n\nPlayers select one of several characters from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent. The game is set in a 2.5D environment; while character models and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters are restricted to fight within a two-dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.\n\nThe storyline is set within an alternate version of the Justice League's universe. Superman establishes a new world order after the Joker tricks him into killing Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. In an effort to stop Superman, Batman summons members of the Justice League from the mainstream continuity to join his insurgency and end the totalitarian regime. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, gameplay mechanics, and use of the DC Comics license. Injustice became the highest selling game in the United States and United Kingdom during the month of its release. The game also won several awards for \"Best Fighting Game\" in 2013.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Armature Studio","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

It’s a true utopia, blessed with rich natural beauty. But the island harbors a difficult past, and it’s about to be erased, silently, from history.\n\nSoot blight syndrome, an endemic disease, has brought about a rift between the island and the mainland. An offshore platform intended for marine research has long been left abandoned; five years ago, three separate incidents brought the once influential Three Families of Urashima to near ruin. Rumors about children being spirited away have become part of the local folklore, alongside another legend, one that has been repeated on the island since time immemorial...\n\n“Let me tell you the legend of this island: it’s a story of tragic love...”\n\nThe key to saving the island lies with three girls, each of whom belongs to one of the Three Families. These girls aren’t able to change the fate of the island by themselves, but might they succeed with the help of the young man who’s just washed ashore? Claiming that he’s traveled back in time, the man immediately sets out on a lonely path, challenging the longstanding traditions of the island, and seeking to change the future. But those aren’t his only goals...\n\nHow will his presence transform the lives of these three girls, the future of the island, and the fate of the world...?","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/iGCZ1Dn3Zv0","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"Frontwing","Publisher":"PROTOTYPE Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184432,"FileName":"f28bf1b3-eda4-4956-91cf-917d8e53faf4.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184432,"FileName":"a2486d79-7550-4cf4-996e-cc81a3e612a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184432,"FileName":"bed02d25-cafe-476f-ae70-a65dfeccc93f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184432,"FileName":"6924e2c5-78da-43b5-9992-ff669fae183f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184432,"FileName":"73588011-d7dd-4575-b48c-df609e99f80d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184432,"FileName":"83ed936a-34b4-4c1c-930e-9494dd85889f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179603,"Name":"Itadaki Street: Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy: 30th Anniversary","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Itadaki Street: Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary is a board game by Square Enix, and is the fourth installment of the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest crossover series.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179603,"FileName":"4c893a89-5f4a-45b9-b444-5b2f55e7d8a8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179603,"FileName":"a2e9936a-ce61-411e-bacd-4ba4c3789805.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179603,"FileName":"1281f261-7290-40ad-92e1-3820bb095155.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179603,"FileName":"eb93fb9a-f3f7-4b7a-a824-582778b764c6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179603,"FileName":"3982ee2e-b1cc-42cd-b7be-4e52a28beb42.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203066,"Name":"It's Spring Again","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"","Developer":"Asya Yurina","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2017-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203066,"FileName":"d54d86ae-f377-46ad-8b2d-0eb8d57e8cc3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203072,"Name":"Jack N' Jill DX","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Rohan Narang","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2018-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203072,"FileName":"9ab66725-d1cf-4db0-8ac2-5a83ddef7a17.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203072,"FileName":"c3d2d715-ed46-4d1f-9015-5a5d7c300b75.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202752,"Name":"Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Something strange is going on at Camp Eagle Feather.

A single man resides there. As of late the house is visited by unusual Guests which knock on the window shutters inviting the hermit to take part in a game of hide-and-seek. The winning condition is simple, you have to remain alive and to retain your sanity till sunrise. This means that approaching the Visitors head-on might be a terrible idea.\n\nThere is an unusual cabin deep in the woods. It had served as a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers.\n\nBut as of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings; things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of the woods. Come night, it seems like someone's made himself at home in the twilight of rooms, attics, and cellars.\n\nYou need to stay awake and sane till dawn.\n\nThe Lodger is wandering the rooms, evading the unknown, counting minutes till morning. But it's only in the night that he can solve the main puzzle and find the answers. What's going on? Are the Guests real, ot are they just figments of his insomniac imagination? What'd happened to the forest? What's happening to the cabin? Is there a line between reality and imagination?\n\nIn late November, 2011, a strange and troubling event has happened to our studio. We have received an anonymous e-mail which suggested that we should produce some \"unconventional\" game based upon the materials attached to the letter. Such offers are a dime a dozen and most of the time they barely deserve any attention at all, however, this one seemed quite different.\n\nThe attachment contained a set of 19 files added to an archive titled \"lestplay\". The files (snippets of text, scraps of audio recording, video footage fragments) as well as the style and wording of the message itself appeared to be rather disturbing. The surface examination did not reveal anything straightforwardly terrifying, yet we could not escape the feeling that something truly sinister was lurking underneath.\n\nThe stranger was begging us to complete the project he has started, yet he also made us well aware of the risk we took as the proposed ludic situation would potentially explain what calamity befell whoever has compiled the ominous archive, thus urging ourselves to meet the same fate.\n\nThe unknown Author was a gentleman and a scholar - he stated that he would introduce no boundaries to our creative freedom, yet he insisted that along with the ludic situation itself the items forming the \"lestplay\" archive should be included into the game, \"else everything would be futile\".\n\nAlongside a significant number of others, we tend to lend a certain amount of credibility to mysticism, yet this specific predicament seemed more like a shoddy mystification. We were fed up with a massive number of similar \"cursed files\" tricks and at times we felt inclined to erase the whole thing for good.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Ice-pick Lodge","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203081,"FileName":"ff527921-ac05-4342-9ccb-10011af2ef51.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203081,"FileName":"83033deb-5e99-4662-a4bd-833816386f16.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203090,"Name":"Knytt Underground","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Knytt Underground, the sequel to the massively popular Knytt and Knytt Stories, is the next stage in the well-liked series, with the original boasting over 1 million downloads globally.

Due to the file-size limitations it didn't include the optional content - Hell Temple area and Time Attack mode, which were later available as additional download in Japan. The later PC port includes this content within the base game. The PS Vita version, called La-Mulana EX, features further improvements to the gameplay as well as new bestiary and rearrangement of several item placements.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/2wjRgQ-k0FE","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"NIGORO","Publisher":"Rising Star Games Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"1cd08846-bab9-455e-a8ea-3d69fce383b4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"0f9fecb2-9617-485f-8cf8-616b88efc59f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"144a4db6-086e-469a-9402-137fb37ca235.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"5986521c-aeff-45e4-8e99-e9021f34c1b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"9b823ecb-c91d-4c52-b2f0-d924ff050db0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"011238a7-e2c9-404b-b535-557c3f4559f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184434,"FileName":"345c1d7f-340c-4e45-b36a-9f8bf96f40c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127214,"Name":"Lara Croft GO","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lara Croft GO is a turned-based puzzle game and a spin-off of the Tomb Raider series similar to the earlier Hitman GO. The game consists of circa 40 levels divided over five environments. Shown from an isometric-like viewpoint, Lara is guided through swipes. A level is built up through nodes connected by lines. A swipe moves Lara to the next node as long as the path is not obstructed. Puzzle elements appear through obstacles and branching node paths. Levers are used to move platforms and certain path elements are fragile so they can only be crossed a few times before they disappear. Certain levers or switches are only active for a few turns.\n\nThere are animals (snakes, spiders, lizards ...) and enemies that can move every turn as well and have different movement patterns. Lara can take them out with a gun or a throwable spear, but they often need to be positioned in a certain direction so Lara is not attacked after completing a turn and moving to a node where she is vulnerable. There are also moving traps such as saw blades or rolling boulders that change position with every turn. Unlike Hitman Go that focuses more on stealth, this game is entirely about puzzle-solving and introduces vertical planes with surfaces that can be climbed next to horizontal ones.\n\nAlong the way Lara can collect hidden gems and fragments that form relics. It is a commercial game with in-app purchases to access the solutions for all levels and additional outfit packs.\n\nVersion 2.0 (November, 2015) introduced a new chapter - Cave of Fire featuring 11 new levels with harder puzzles, a new gameplay mechanic, new collectible items and so on.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"Square Enix Montréal","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2016-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":127214,"FileName":"4b9cc809-1a58-48df-9819-1d2b1ecaddb4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":127214,"FileName":"a2d26c6c-08c1-40da-8512-4acb69b93bad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202358,"Name":"Laser Disco Defenders","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Summary: Join up the Laser Disco Defenders on their mission to defeat the evil Lord Monotone and prevent him from using the Mirror Moon to force the galaxy into dancing along to his, and only his, tune.

The player controls a protagonist simply known as the The Boy, who is said to enter the world Limbo in search of his sister. However, the story as a whole can also be seen as a metaphor for the search for companionship and getting around in a new environment. Not a single clue is given at the start, there are no cut-scenes and the game starts right away. In that world filled with hazards and danger, his means are few and he is extremely vulnerable. Only two buttons are used, a feeble jump and one to perform an action, combined with movement. This allows him to explore the world and hang on ledges, slide down slopes, push objects, pull levers, and cling to ropes, but the player has to make most of what is present in the environment to get by, often with physics-based elements.\n\nThe gloomy world has a dusty filter showing the game through misted glass, and no vivid colours are present. It is divided into 24 chapters that seamlessly flow into each other, only from the level selection in the main menu can be derived where a new chapter starts. The world is rendered in 2D but with different layers of depth in the scenery. It moves from a forest to an abandoned city and eventually an industrial zone. The player faces three kinds of challenges. There are obstacles where The Boy simply needs to find a way to progress, there are dangerous creatures that hunt him down and try to kill them, and finally there is a gang of children who band together to ward off the intruder and set up traps for him, with a touch of Lord of the Flies. Encounters with other humans are however brief and rare. These account for most of the horror moments, of the psychological kind, with other unnerving sequences like when the player is forced to use the corpses of other children as a bridge.\n\nMusic and sound effects are minimal and there are no on-screen elements referring to health or other statistics. Every single misstep, often with gruesome consequences, is fatal. In the same vein the boy cannot jump from great heights or jump very far. When dead, the game immediately reloads before the current puzzle. Most of the encounters are centered around puzzles and these are sometimes based on timing or speed when being chased. Other elements serve only for setting the scene, when The Boy gets to ride a boat to cross a lake (he cannot swim and drowns immediately) or finds the corpses of the people who did not make it in Limbo. Most of the game elements are discovered through experimentation, like the effects of a glowing worm that attaches itself to The Boy's head, changing the flow of gravity, or what happens when a giant spider captures him. There is only a single path through the levels and generally there is only a single solution to a problem.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Double Eleven","Publisher":"Playdead","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20770,"FileName":"bf5b6d2a-c675-4ea3-bc71-c69687d957a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20770,"FileName":"47eccc5e-46e4-43df-b867-9b5689027922.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20770,"FileName":"70d88d0b-8596-4758-9674-a63a925bf48f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203161,"Name":"Link-a-Pix Deluxe","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Link-a-Pix is a clue-linking puzzle where every grid has a picture hidden inside.

Since LittleBigPlanet 2, gameplay has expanded to being a \"platform for games\" with the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platforming game. Most LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various \"prize bubbles\" along the way. These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation. There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more depending on the number of players stated in the level.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRs7LqswtvY","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Double Eleven","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"00013775-7b4f-41a2-9538-ce302ea233bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"2e4f7423-8c08-48d5-9ad2-d2145d45ff5f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"144b49fe-a03b-4cdf-9b18-12586c1d4a9a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"7892fa00-8044-42e1-8296-707ab568514e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"d4c1bfb3-1c80-4fe2-af17-424aae6cebe3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"c0d4053c-2191-4b4a-bd70-9395b781d0d8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"88a08fb6-80b4-4ca7-96b6-f1e0889e04ae.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12549,"FileName":"bdf9f659-5905-4157-a5b3-7ddcf24b6de5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12549,"AlternateName":"Little Big Planet PS Vita","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":166758,"Name":"LittleBigPlanet: Marvel Super Hero Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A Marvel Super Hero Edition was later released in 2014 which features the original PlayStation Vita game with added on-cart DLC (Costumes + Marvel Arcade Pack).","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU6RnPqz9C0","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Double 11","Publisher":"SCEE","ReleaseDate":"2014-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166758,"FileName":"27ae63df-3c44-4d43-8cac-74c43e328b2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":166758,"FileName":"5b8c5337-bef2-486c-8c01-c9a50ff47028.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":166758,"FileName":"c1ede290-e5e9-480f-82b3-ee99cb5c0ba6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166758,"FileName":"4fbec18b-b6e5-4dfa-adf7-edbb138162da.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166758,"FileName":"4b418a5a-a4ea-40dd-b70f-3db08930dbf8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":166758,"AlternateName":"LittleBigPlanet PlayStation Vita Marvel Super Hero Edition","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166758,"AlternateName":"Little Big Planet: Marvel Super Hero Edition","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":193879,"Name":"London Detective Mysteria","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Her Majesty's birthday was to be the heiress of House Whiteley’s debut into high society, but an inquiring mind begs for more than parties as she stumbles into the many curiosities that lay hidden in London’s darkest corners.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.

The player guides a character using a side view through an environment that reacts to actions, movement and input. Most of the times the character does not need to touch anything in the environment for it to react. Shapes start to move, numbers appear, platforms appear or disappear and so on. To get through the puzzle sequences the player always needs to experiment with the effects of input and then find a way to move platforms or overcome obstacles. Initially all reactions are based on movement and jumping, but later on several Vita-specific types of input are used, such as the touchpad, camera and motion functionality.\n\nThere are about 60 puzzle sequences divided over six worlds each with a different theme. The game never provides hints, but often there are clues in the environment, such as numbers adding up to show how shapes can move or percentages changing based on movement. In later levels sequences sometimes have multiple types of checkpoints that can be used to respawn at a further position than when initially starting the sequence. In some levels projectiles can be shot to reveal or hide platforms, or alter parts of the environment. The back camera is for instance used to capture certain colours in the real world to solve puzzles in the game. At the end of each world there is a choice between two doors to progress and the choices by players worldwide are compared.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4IFX5hkrk","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Digital Dreams","Publisher":"Digital Dreams","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21584,"FileName":"d02e363f-23b0-4ccc-9840-77e041a74c72.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21584,"FileName":"6b0fc227-d249-46c2-9a28-b5b6e192ebb2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21584,"FileName":"e9d004f1-9e89-4782-b57a-bd1bb7df1b53.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21584,"FileName":"c1f0218b-68f4-48b3-bc30-a3a4f31214a3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184089,"Name":"Metropolis: Lux Obscura","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Metropolis Lux Obscura is a unique game with a film noir atmosphere, seductive wanton women, and dirty dangerous secrets.

Each enemy has a different type of Xel, which can grant Beck temporary power-ups such as healing or increased defense. After defeating another Mighty Number in a boss battle, Beck may also use their unique Xels to transform and gain new weaponry. Call is also available in co-op play; while she cannot absorb Xels, she falls slower, dashes farther, and has a shield that absorbs projectiles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Abstraction Games","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35277,"FileName":"d4efeefb-d4d5-4c83-b17f-12d73195937b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203176,"Name":"Miles & Kilo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Race across a curious island in this fast-paced, light-hearted platformer\n\nMiles and Kilo have been attacked by a mischievous specter!

The game was initially started as Wasteland Kings, a prototype created for the 2013 Mojam game jam. The developers then started work on a full version and took it to Steam's Early Access. Typical for the genre the game is meant to be played in multiple runs, with randomized environments, and weapon and monster placement for each session. It consists of several levels played in succession, each with a different theme, until the character gets a shot to claim the nuclear throne and become the new king. Many levels contain bosses with a brief introduction.\n\nThere is permadeath and up to twelve different playable characters can be unlocked, representing different playing styles. Next to the basic attack each character has a unique secondary action such as a roll or forming a shield, along with a general perk. The game is played as a twin-stick shooter where both movement and firing in any direction can be independently combined. Levels are short and always consist of a single, scrolling room. When all enemies are defeated a vortex appears that sucks the character into the next level. Levels contain random chests with weapons such as a revolver, machinegun, smart gun, minigun, shotgun, rifles, an incinerator, sluggers, bows, grenade launchers and bazookas, but also melee weapons such as a wrench or a screwdriver. Ranged weapons usually have a limited amount of ammo and require ammo pick-ups to keep using them. Up to two weapons can be carried and they can be swapped when a new one is encountered.\n\nEnemies leave behind radioactive fragments known as rads. These can also be found as pick-ups.

The majority of the time is spent with mundane tasks, e.g. preparing the protagonist's wedding ceremony, but unfortunately one person knows the secret: a crazy chef who is in the mood for sushi...\n\nThis is commercial and further developed successor to the freeware game Octodad. While the objectives themselves are not too complicated, e.g. doing the dishes, the challenge comes from the fact that each limb is controlled separately. Of course this makes coordinated movement hard and, along with the deliberately oversensitive physics simulation, results in chaos and slapstick moments. However, making chaos when other people are watching fills up a suspicion meter which eventually causes Octodad to be recognized and leads to a game over. Sometimes there are small stealth sequences in which the protagonist can't be seen at all.\n\nAfter finishing the campaign, the six levels can be replayed in order to find hidden ties or beating the developers' best time. In co-op mode, each player controls one limb (or two with less than four participants). The level editor is exclusive to the Windows version, but the user levels can also be played on Macintosh and Linux.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Young Horses","Publisher":"Young Horses","ReleaseDate":"2014-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193945,"FileName":"286abf3e-e6c3-4b31-a05e-925eeef099ee.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193947,"Name":"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee: New 'n' Tasty!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is a faithful remake of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee where the pre-rendered sceneries are recreated in real-time 3D without changing the original gameplay.

The player selects one from four young female characters: the student Mikoto, oracle Waka, Maid Itsuki or ninja Yuzuha. They fight against various monsters, robots, etc. and try to find the mysterious Phantom who has kidnapped the sister of one of the girls.\n\nThe game consists of several levels where large groups of enemies need to be defeated by stringing together moves into combos. As its origins are in one-on-one fighting, there are a larger amount of moves. Girls have access to weak, medium and strong attacks combined with special moves. They can also dash, break of cancel guard and jump between the foreground and the background to dodge. Each heroine uses her own weapon, like a spear or a sword. Through fights experience points are earned to access new skills from a small skill tree between levels.\n\nNext to the single-player mode there is a cooperative mode, an arcade mode focused on clear times and high scores, and the competitive battlegrounds mode against other players.\n\nThe later PS4 release, called Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds - Overdrive introduces new skills and abilities for character customization, such as air dash attack, shadow attack and triple jump. Some of these are found in new, secret alternative routes that require certain conditions to unlock. These also lead to new items (such as Out Range and Aura items) and enemies. With the new abilities, some levels now have more enemies on the screen at once, but there are also more item drops. The game music has been re-arranged as well.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"5pb.

The former is tasked with apprehending suspects, while the latter oversees and commands their subordinate colleagues. After all, Enforcers possess high Crime Coefficients. However, because of their criminal nature, they can better understand what makes other criminals tick, allowing them to sniff out suspects and arrest the true perpetrators. But because of their criminal background, Inspectors are needed to provide a calm and sound judgement to each case. Ultimately, all members of the MWPSB have to walk a fine line, maintaining their own mental health while facing the worst that society has to offer.\n\nWith justice in their hearts, the detectives of Division 1 tackle each case, confronting humanity's ugly truths.\n\nBut, what lies ahead?","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Visual Novel","Developer":"Nitroplus","Publisher":"5pb.

It has more modern graphics and sound, but still closely resembles the original game in overall design. Just like the original game the player controls the blue character Putty through different levels where he has to free red characters that have been taken prisoner by invading forces. The game is played as a side-scrolling platformer, but at a slower pace with more focus on exploration and puzzle elements to juggle different abilities to reach the captured characters, even though there are many enemies present. To complete a level all other blobs need to be freed and then the area can be exited through a door.\n\nAs an amorphous blob, Putty has a number of abilities. He can stretch in the four major directions to reach items or move up platforms. He can also jump and flatten himself completely to avoid enemies. He has different types of attacks that can be upgraded throughout the game, ranging from a simple punch to electrical shocks and darts. Not all available abilities are available right away, they are upgraded or become available by collecting stars in levels. There are different types of items and these can be absorbed to use them at a later date. These are restored in a bar on the right side of the screen where they can be selected. Putty can for instance launch rockets, throw bombs, activate a shield, or call in a pod that provides free movement anywhere in the level for 30 seconds. He is also able to inflate and then use an hot air stream to scale heights, but only for a limited amount of time.\n\nHe has a limited amount of lives and a number of hearts per life. Optionally players can collect all yellow stars in a level. Each level has a time limit and time can be extended by freeing prisoners and collecting clock items. At any moment a map mode can be activated where the game zooms on out to show the entire level. Levels are selected from a global map screen where they are unlocked gradually. The main game mode is called marathon and there is a separate challenge mode for speedruns and other challenges with medals when certain conditions are met. There is also a tutorial available. By playing well players unlock stickers in a sticker book. When all stickers on a single page are unlocked, an additional level becomes available.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/5QTS7zihLTQ","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"System 3","Publisher":"System 3","ReleaseDate":"2014-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184446,"FileName":"25a191ea-78bb-4d34-8745-8c71ff58683b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":184446,"FileName":"f6eab827-42de-4f2e-b527-817f086bdd3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184446,"FileName":"c0a547ec-b267-4450-837d-e924a1a84af7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184446,"FileName":"8de1f4a0-0bf6-4b60-ae98-bb8c266473e8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184446,"FileName":"ab742965-5ea4-4e05-99bd-f4d993a8f353.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184446,"FileName":"fc6997be-d02a-47d8-b75f-625b906421f6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203385,"Name":"Puzzle by Nikoli V: Slitherlink","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"","Developer":"Hamster Co.","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203385,"FileName":"e164554a-ae8e-453c-99fc-2c3bee10616f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203384,"Name":"Puzzle by Nikoli V: Sudoku","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Puzzle by Nikoli V: Sudoku contains 50 sudoku puzzles for players to solve, from simple puzzles to super-difficult ones.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Hamster Co.","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-03-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203384,"FileName":"39e852fa-d18b-402f-9f3c-5cb0b20eb912.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203386,"Name":"Q*bert: Rebooted","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"One of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful arcade games of the 1980s is back in its classic pixel perfect 2D form, and a re-imagined Rebooted version with state of the art 3D game-play and graphics that remain faithful to the original concept.

The player controls a solar craft hovering above the surface and it needs to survive as long as possible, racing after the sun that provides the power to move on. The game world is procedurally generated and changes each day. It is divided into regions with a completely different lay-out each day, but with fixed mutators for each region to build a similar difficulty curve for every session.\n\nTo survive the craft needs to dodge moving and falling blocks, pillars, shapes and projectiles that appear in quick succession. Acceleration is done automatically and it cannot be slowed down. The craft can be steered left and right endlessly, as there is no border to the game world. The quickest way to gain speed is by picking up yellow boost items, slightly reversing the sun path for a while. Green items provide a jump that can be triggered at any moment, allowing the craft to fly. Purple ones provide a second chance after a crash. Obstacles are not the only concern, as tunnels, clouds or objects blacking out the sun also need to be avoided as they deplete the available energy. The game is over when there is no more sunlight or after a crash. Along the way blue tris can be collected, triangles that add up to a score multiplier. When bumping into an obstacle, not causing a complete collision, some speed is lost and the multiplier is reset. The gameplay is fast-paced and requires good reflexes in the later regions. By steering in a certain direction and quickly switching, a barrel roll can be performed.\n\nThe game offers different objectives that can be completed over multiple sessions, such as achieving a certain amount of air time, clearing a region without a single collision, collecting a number of tris, achieving a certain score etc. This allows the craft to level up with a cap at 25. With almost every level some new options become available, such as decals for the ship or attachments. The latter include a magnet that collects nearby pick-ups automatically, a battery to survive longer without energy, storage for multiple jump pick-ups or shields etc. These have an upgraded version as well. It is possible to fit multiple attachments at a certain level and another type of bonus provides a higher multiplier level at the start.\n\nAfter a while a secondary Apocalypse mode is unlocked, set in a different world with a higher difficulty level and meteorites that cause temporary blindness. The game's editor support the creation and sharing of user made levels through the Steam workshop. These can be downloaded and played separately and some are also accessed in the game's main mode through world portals in the game world, temporarily moving the game into a very different environment before continuing. There are global leaderboards to compare scores.\n\nIn February 2015 the unlockable Labyrinthia mode was added. It is an advanced, randomized maze filled with obstacles, switches and moving parts. It largely takes the sun and reflex based movement out of the equation in favour of planning ahead. It uses a more zoomed out view.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Flippfly LLC","Publisher":"Flippfly LLC","ReleaseDate":"2013-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193958,"FileName":"7affa401-b7d4-4a99-aae2-4b361ccb1946.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11746,"Name":"Ragnarok Odyssey","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ragnarok Odyssey is set in an original world based on Norse mythology where a battle is being waged between humans and giants after the fall of the gods had previously separated the races.

While those put a twist on the concept of Robotron: 2084, Resogun draws inspiration from Defender, but with fixed patterns of enemies similar to Galaga rather than randomized attacks. The game consists of five levels (Acis, Ceres, Decima, Febris, and Mefitis) with bright neon colours where the player steers a space ship that needs to survive as long as possible through three phases followed by a boss. Levels consist of backdrops that are wrapped around as a cylinder and it is possible to get a glimpse of the other side of the level. The ship can shoot and move left or right and there is no border to it.\n\nBonuses are earned by saving humans. These are shown as green figures locked up in chambers. Different types of space ships will attempt to kill the humans, who are only vulnerable when they are out of the chamber, and this need to be prevented by shooting down the invaders. At certain moments a human will be freed when certain enemies marked in green called keepers are destroyed. The ship can then pick up the human and drop it off at a marked location to set it free and receive bonuses such as boost, overdrive (more powerful weapons), smart bombs (clear the screen), shield or extra points. Boost provides a short moment of invincibility where the ship can crash into other ships destroying them, but also extending the boost. That way it can be maintained for a long time if the ship races through the enemy formations in a structured way.\n\nPower-ups and bonuses appear as large green crosses that can be shot to open them. Players are encouraged to keep the destruction going to maintain a score multiplier, which has a different cap based on the chosen difficulty level. The game can be played in an arcade mode (complete the levels one after another) or with single levels. There are four difficulty settings (Rookie, Experienced, Veteran, and Master) and three ships (Nemesis, Ferox, and Phobos) to choose from with different parameters for agility, boost and overdrive. The game supports online cooperative multiplayer games, but not local ones.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Housemarque Ltd.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC","ReleaseDate":"2014-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34963,"FileName":"e3fda53b-64f0-4b54-a162-9646ae2984f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34963,"FileName":"00423c50-b89d-488c-95e4-d27090d0daa2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34963,"FileName":"c419ac46-cc66-4f68-a711-cd369e60dfe7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34963,"FileName":"54cb6e96-c9cd-4c8d-98cc-8bfbf8648419.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16336,"Name":"Retro City Rampage","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Are you rad enough to outrun the law and carjack the '80s?

The player is the lone survivor of a space train that got shot out of orbit and crash landed on a mysterious planet.\n\nEach stage starts with the player spawning in a random spot. The first aim is to find a teleporter, also randomly spawned somewhere in that stage. When the teleporter is found and activated, it will take 90 seconds to be fully active. During this time, several enemies will spawn, including a boss. After the teleporter loading time is complete, the player must then kill all enemies that are left in order to be teleported to the next stage.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the game is that difficulty increases over time: a difficulty bar is shown in the top right corner of the screen. Every five minutes the difficulty increases one level, so the quicker the player finds his way out of stages, the easier the later stages are. In order to keep up with the challenge, the players must equip their characters with items that were being carried by the space train. There are more than 100 different items (most of which must be unlocked), each with a different effect, such as inflicting damage to enemies as they approach the player, increasing healing rate, slowing down hit enemies, double jump, etc. The effects are stackable, so if two or more items of the same kind are collected a multiplier will be added to it. Items are dropped by boss enemies, but are more commonly found in locked chests. To unlock chests, players must collect money dropped by enemies when killed. Money is also used to activate drones that will help the player.\n\nPlayers can choose different characters, each one with different skills. Every character has 4 different actions, like different weapons or defensive maneuvers, plus one usable item slot. There are 12 different characters available, but they must be unlocked by finding items or performing some achievements.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Hopoo Games","Publisher":"Hopoo Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193964,"FileName":"47e930ae-9f92-414a-9235-08fcd2c13896.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22611,"Name":"Road Not Taken","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Road Not Taken is a roguelike puzzle game about surviving life’s surprises.

To take advantage of this, there are also dozens of weapons to utilize, ranging from handguns to rifles, to flamethrowers to miniguns. The levels are much more bigger and open ended this time around; allowing for secret areas that hide weapons and costume items.\n\nNew to the game is the Rescue Mode, a 4 player online/offline co-op mode where players take control of the budgie commandos from the previous game and, as the namesake, rescue other commandos across four randomly generated themed levels. In game, they can upgrade themselves by finding costumes around levels, and buying weapons from the shops.\n\nThis game also includes stereoscopic 3D, enhanced voices in both English and Japanese, enhanced graphics and visual effects and a new soundtrack by New World Revolution.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Ratloop Asia","Publisher":"Ratloop Asia","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193966,"FileName":"ffecaff5-dee8-4c03-8a6c-a23c30035566.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":193966,"FileName":"db0a2f3e-007f-4a28-a5f6-2d20e468207c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16374,"Name":"Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Annihilate an evil penguin regime in Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken, a cinematic platform adventure game offering full solo and co-op campaigns updated and expanded to use the PS Vita system features.

One day, he goes on a treasure hunt, accompanied by his son and heir, Gerard. But the emperor is slain by a horrible monster, and now Gerard, the child of royal blood, has to continue his work.\n\nIn this game, you control the royal family of Avalon throughout several generations.

Each time the old emperor passes away, you'll have to choose a heir for him out of four candidates. The choice of those candidates depends on chance and on your decisions to recruit party members during your reign. You'll learn various techniques during the game and then assign them to your party members (a party contains five active characters). Characters can die permanently, i.e., become unavailable for the rest of the game, in case they lose their life points; each time a character's HP reaches zero in battle, the character loses one life point.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game was released exclusively in Japan.\n\nThe worldwide release on modern platforms in December 2017 saw the game completely translated in English, with updated graphics and audio, new character classes, a new dungeon and a New Game+ feature.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Square Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184450,"FileName":"c8a7cef5-370e-4629-b70c-dc10fdbfaa97.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184450,"FileName":"e774bbc0-4947-4a7a-acec-567cf2422fc9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184450,"FileName":"321dc1e5-cc3d-499a-876a-017dfb9bedc3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":184450,"FileName":"9dbed2be-78fe-4a32-9ae6-b2722fdcd480.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184450,"FileName":"3a237fb0-54d7-4db8-882b-e9ffd7e21a79.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184450,"FileName":"7a9cbb46-e939-4bf9-872d-52ac554998af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184451,"Name":"Romancing SaGa 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The celebrated RPG classic comes west for the first time!

Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei–that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as “LABO.” The city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.\n\nThe story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists’ stories can the player piece together the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"Yeti","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2018-03-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202799,"FileName":"d4b9317c-16f4-49d6-881b-1a818e57ff33.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193740,"Name":"Root Letter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Root Letter is the first in a brand new ‘Kadokawa Game Mystery’ series - a collection of Visual Novels with exceptionally high production values.\nSet in Shimane prefecture - a place rich in history, culture and natural beauty - Root Letter revolves around the mystery of Fumino Aya, your old high school pen friend who went missing 15 years ago.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Hyde","Publisher":"Kadokawa Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193740,"FileName":"61a02ba3-2a1d-42ac-858e-dd242ebda5cb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":193740,"AlternateName":"√Letter","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":203400,"Name":"Roundabout","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Roundabout is an open world driving puzzle game where you control a constantly rotating limousine!

Like in other games of its kind all forward movement is automatic and all the player has to do is tap the screen at the right time to make Sackboy jump. Jumping is needed to avoid obstacles and enemies as well as collecting bubbles and other items that can be found. Colliding with an obstacle like spikes or an enemy and the game ends, however enemies are knocked out if jumped onto. What also needs to be avoided is the pink goo which slows down Sackboy and allows the Negativitron to catch up. To escape it the player has to swipe across the screen to gain speed.\n\nThe game is free-to-play and the bubbles are the main currency used in the game. These are collected in the game but can also be acquired with real money. In the game's shop bubbles can be used to acquire costumes and power-up upgrades as well as lucky chests with random content. Like in many other free-to-play games there are boosts that can be activated before a game and also these cost bubbles. Another way to spend bubbles is to skip mission challenges. Missions are done by clearing specific objectives and by doing them the player can level up. By levelling up the player's score multiplier increases. Another object that the player can collect in the game as well as acquire with real money are the save-me-hearts. These can be used at the game over screen to revive Sackboy and allows the player to continue playing without losing his score.\n\nSome power-ups can be found around the stages and they are automatically activated when picked up. This includes a magnet that allows Sackboy to collect bubbles at a a greater range and the jetpack which allows him to fly. They are active for a limited amount of time but by spending bubbles on upgrades this time can be extended. Other objects that can be collected are stickers. Once all stickers of a certain theme have been collected the player is awarded with a special prize. There are also some stickers that unlock content in other LittleBigPlanet games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Firesprite","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment Europe","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125593,"FileName":"480941b5-1713-47f3-8c28-5bfb961cc0a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125593,"FileName":"80a0d9f2-8a10-4333-a7f8-d3f1daee9df9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125593,"FileName":"1d82459b-f5ed-4dea-a2ee-6ece4fb86a7f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203399,"Name":"Rush Rover","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Ratalaika Games","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2020-04-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203399,"FileName":"0704cc72-9bfd-4542-99e1-42fc1d82c66f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203399,"FileName":"e5d82627-880d-4fe9-ba02-f5c2c9b5f932.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19964,"Name":"Rymdkapsel","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rymdkapsel is a 2013 minimalist real-time strategy video game by indie developer Grapefrukt, the studio of Martin Jonasson.

It was developed by Acquire, authors of the Tenchu and Way of the Samurai series, as a sequel to Shinobido: Way of the Ninja and Shinobido: Tales of the Ninja. A downloadable content pack, Mirror Spirits, was released on May 9, 2012.[citation needed] The game, along with its DLC, was removed from the PSN Store in 2016, most likely due to the license expiring from Bandai Namco in North America and the PAL region.\nPlayers take the role of one of the two main characters, Zen and Kaede. The main town features various menus. Some allow players to equip ninja tools such as caltrops, mines, shurikens, potions, smoke bombs, etc., while others let them accept missions from the three primary daimyou. As they progress through the story, players have the choice of which daimyou they want to help, and they are encouraged to only help that daimyou, encouraging three separate playthroughs. The daimyou issue various missions such as assassinating a certain target, protecting a shipping crate with supplies, freeing captive peasants, or stealing resources. Once a mission is selected, players are dropped into a map filled with enemies and treasures to collect. They must utilize stealth and a variety of skills such as a grapple hook, silent assassinations, counter attacks, etc., in order to complete their objective. Once they level up, they can put attribute points into max health, attack, defense, an extended special attack meter that allows for the Zankoku attack (a teleporting silent kill), and a longer grapple hook. Along the way, players will encounter various bosses, such as enemy ninja clan leaders, and eventually the other daimyou themselves. Players can utilize items to weaken their foes or try to lure them into a silent kill, allowing for a wide variety of play-styles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPya1VIRqoA","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Stealth","Developer":"Acquire","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12444,"FileName":"dc1c0995-5a64-45ba-89f2-92fe1055775e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174238,"Name":"Shiren the Wanderer: The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shiren The Wanderer: The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate is the latest installment in the storied franchise.

It is the successor to McMillen and Jonathan McEntee's 2008 Flash game Meat Boy. Super Meat Boy was released on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade in October 2010, on Microsoft Windows in November 2010, on OS X a year later in November 2011, on Linux in December 2011 as a part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4, in May 2012 as a part of the Humble Indie Bundle V, and on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in October 2015. In the game the player controls Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing as the player runs and jumps through over 300 hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. Additional player-created levels are available for free download.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in January 2009. McMillen worked on level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested primarily by the pair and their families. Initially intended for release in early 2010 for personal computers and the WiiWare download service, the release date was pushed back as the design was changed to include more levels and exclude multiplayer modes. The WiiWare version was canceled due to the service's technical limitations. The music for the game was created by Danny Baranowsky, who had also composed the music for Meat Boy. The soundtrack was released as an album, and music from it was released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3.\n\nThe game was critically acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned that not all players would appreciate the level of difficulty. The game was a commercial success, and sold more than one million copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development.[1]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Team Meat","Publisher":"Team Meat","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34180,"FileName":"06db243f-cad1-4dba-b29c-063d49ebf2ee.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34180,"FileName":"05db6222-f1f9-4575-b5bd-a9c5ddb0d11d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34180,"FileName":"717a75d9-dfbb-46f4-9e90-6040e29215dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34180,"FileName":"e0d2270f-f7b8-40c3-beea-00fd8c2a8333.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12556,"Name":"Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Experience Super Monkey Ball as you've never seen it before!

In the AD Dimension Might Senpuuji, the richest boy on the planet, fights against criminals in Nouvelle Tokyo while the girls of Arzenal island, stripped of all rights because of their inability to manipulate Mana, protect the world from incursions of dragons in order to pay for their continued existence. In the Universal Century Dimension a broken world, ravaged by endless war between the Federation and Neo Zeon and the global ecological disaster of Third Impact, attempts to heal as the independent military group Mithril investigates the source of Out Of Place technology derived from the Whispered: people aware of technology that does not exist. Behind the scenes god-like figures secretly manipulate the events of the three Earths to their own goals, with no regard for the innocent lives lost in the process.\n\nSuper Robot Wars V is a standalone title in the long-running series, marking the 25th anniversary of the Super Robot Wars franchise. This entry also marks the first appearance of Space Battleship Yamato in the SRW series, which is notable for not actually having any robots.The player starts by selecting their point-of-view character, either the washed up pilot haunted by his past failures Souji Murakumo, or the out of her depth rookie with no experience Chitose Kisaragi. This pilot can be renamed, and depending on the pilot their reactions during cutscenes, and some missions, will change. During a routine mission the pilot will chance upon the experimental mecha suit VangRay, falling into the Yamato's crew and joining them on their journey across space and dimensions.\n\nAs in past SRW games SRW V follows the game flow of Base mode, followed by Adventure mode, followed by Scenario mode, and then back again.

The game has a bright visual style inspired by 50's art and corresponding music, and uses a lot of B-movie-inspired humor with many references to other indie games in the background environment.\n\nThe blob can move left and right and jump. While in the air a dash can be performed to quickly move down, also to destroy objects below. Levels are usually split up in smaller sections with multiple checkpoints, locked through a cork. In order to pass, the blob needs to absorbs various objects along the way to grow to the required size. Similar to the Katamari games certain items can only be absorbed when a certain size has been reached. As a blob it is also able to squeeze through narrow passages.\n\nVarious gameplay elements are introduced gradually. Through telekinesis certain objects such as platforms can be moved. In sections with magnetism it is possible to stick to magnetic surfaces or repel from them by changing polarity, gaining boost. There are also sections where the blob can be moved freely around the environment, boosting around in any direction with a more powerful boost to gain speed. Next to the main levels various mini-game levels can be unlocked where courses need to be completed. Depending on the objects sometimes multiple hits can be taken and health is recharged at the next checkpoint. Various small blue orbs can be eaten to reach a high score, tracked on global leaderboards.

The available game modes are Battle, Battle Ultimate, Endless, Marathon, Sprint, and Ultra.\nBattle is a versus mode against the computer or another player. There are four difficulty levels for the computer.\n\nBattle Ultimate is a versus mode that introduces power-ups to clear lines, have the grid scroll sideways, explode blocks, or shower opponents with blocks to remain the last one standing. Power-ups are gained by clearing lines that have symbols.\n\nEndless lets you play up to level 30, with a faster speed for each new level.\n\nMarathon is the classic mode where you need to clear a number of lines to reach a new level with faster speed, with fifteen levels in total.\n\nSprint is about clearing 40 lines as quickly as possible.\n\nUltra provides three minutes to achieve a high score.\nNot all game modes are available right away. Endless for instance is only unlocked after completing Marathon. Multiplayer is supported both offline and online, for up to four players and game types such as Marathon or Endless. Players can also work together or co-op or in a team to clear lines on a grid that is larger than the standard one. There is a leveling system with belts based on the player's performance, also used for online matchmaking. The core gameplay remains unchanged. Pieces can be moved left and right, drop quickly, or are rotated. The next piece is shown and it also possible to hold on to one to use it at a later time. The game includes an in-game store for additional content and generates a Tetris Self diagram, an AI-controlled version of your playing style and performance friends can play against when you are offline. By enabling Tetris Live you open up your games for other players to join. Game options include enabling hold pieces, using the 7-bag or the classic selection for tetrominoes, toggling wall kicks and T-spins, and altering the time it takes for a piece to lock into place on the grid.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"SoMa Play Inc.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2015-06-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26706,"FileName":"169484f3-2812-421d-82e1-42ff6c2b1616.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26706,"FileName":"714c1c08-770f-45a2-ba16-096fed04780e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26706,"FileName":"d965eff1-791b-42ab-8249-2ae942b06950.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164646,"Name":"The Amazing Spider-Man","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Amazing Spider-Man is a tie-in to the movie of the same name. The story is a direct continuation of the movie and deals with an experiment gone wrong: Oscorp researches a cross-species mutation virus; the same which caused Lizard to appear. This virus reaches Manhattan and Spider-Man has to help the infected humans and find a cure.\n\nThis version returns to the open world-concept which was abandoned in the previous few instalments. Spider-Man swings through Manhattan, although the web-shooting is performed automatically by pressing a button, on the way to the next plot point. Those are linear levels in which Spider-Man visits locations like sewers or laboratories and spends most of his time fighting enemies, including the new robot foes. The combat system is reminiscent to the free-flow system used in the Batman: Arkham series: Spidey quickly moves between enemies and bashes them; when his spider-sense goes off the player needs to use the evade button before getting hit. Becauses of Spider-Man's special abilities, he can walk on the ceiling and evade some combat sequences or use his web for a stealth takedown. It is also possible to quickly retreat to the ceiling in case the hero is on the losing side of battle. Besides combat, the levels feature maneuvering, a few open-the-door puzzles and boss fights.\n\nOf course there are various distrations in the open world sequences, the most important being side missions. In those Spidey has to solve smaller tasks like exploring Oscorp labs, passing acrobatic challenges, photographing stuff or bringing infected people to a clinic. All this rewards experience points which can be used to improve Spider-Man's abilities. The collectibles in this game are comic book pages which unlock iconic Spider-Man issues. When in the open world, the player can activate Spidey's web rush ability by choosing on of the designated points on the map: then the game takes control and automatically swings to the point.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Beenox Inc.","Publisher":"Activision Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164646,"FileName":"9c932704-7023-421a-a729-c9751af583db.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164646,"FileName":"2be9d662-2a74-4123-8107-288c77f64374.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164646,"FileName":"862be165-0b83-4f1a-bf80-f868fe46002e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164646,"FileName":"24de0a06-13ff-4d8e-8614-44b6c998ca9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202429,"Name":"The Bard's Tale: Remastered and Resnarkled","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are the Bard, a selfish rogue weary of pointless sub-quests and rat-infested cellars.

It is set in London in 1849 and the player takes control of a master burglar. In 100 days Scotland Yard will activate The Devil's Basilisk, advanced artificial intelligence technology that will massively improve surveillance and make theft almost impossible. Therefore the thief has 100 days to steal the Basilisk and prevent it from being activated.\n\nThe master burglar is never seen in the game and does not take part in the action. Instead he sends out lower thieves to perform heists. A thief is sent down from an airship, the main hub, using a pod. When the heist is successful the thief can return to the airship with the haul where the money can be spent in five skill trees: agility, abilities, tools, goggles and miscellaneous. The game consists of six main locations that are randomly generated for level design, enemies and items with each new heist. By earning money the main goal is to buy additional security clearance, opening up new locations, until the Basilisk can be stolen in the final location to win the game. The six main locations are The Slums, Warehouse District, New Belgravia, Casino Town, The Banks, and The Swindle. Each started heist, whether successful or not, takes up a single day. The game is lost if the Basilisk is not stolen in 100 days because the game ends after that limit. Each new location provides opportunities to steal a lot more money, but also introduces more difficulty security and more dangerous guards. That way the game challenges the player to take calculated risks. By saving up it is possible to move on to harder locations quickly, but the money can also be spent on various perks that make the heists easier instead. The thief characters can die or be terminated and a random one is then generated for each new heist after an unsuccessful one. The player is however encouraged to carry on with a single character as an experience bonus is provided for completing consecutive heists with the same thief. Bonus are also provided for completing levels without being spotted (ghost) and rewarding aptitude.\n\nEach heist takes place in a side-scrolling, fairly small area with connected rooms. There are various approaches through doors, climbing pipes, creating entrances with bombs or smashing windows. The character can move around and jump. By upgrading elements in the agility skill tree additional options can be unlocked and often be upgraded multiple times, such as wall jumping and clinging to walls, double jumping and stealth. Most early enemies have a line of sight that is visible to the player, but from New Belgravia onwards enemies with a microphone icon are sensitive to sound and then the slower sneaking method has to be used for movement. Enemies can be taken out by whacking them. Some enemies require multiple hits and others cannot be destroyed permanently with the regular weapon. Unlockable abilities include a hacking skill to disarm bombs, open doors and open cash machines. This is done through a short mini-game where the player has to follow the directions on the screen to press one of four directions, sometimes multiple times. When a mistake is made while disarming a bomb, it explodes right away, killing the thief. Other abilities are bionic eyes, improved hacking, barging through doors and so on. Many different tools can also be unlocked that can be selected during heists. They are bombs to blow through walls, steam purge to use a cloud that obscures vision, bugs that syphon funds, EMPs and so on. Many of these have a limit or use a separate meter that takes some time to recharge. It is possible to switch between tools at any time during a level and they are all available when unlocked. There are also four types of goggles to unlock and other technology such as jamming radio transmissions or improvements for tools and abilities.\n\nWhen a thief is killed, no money is gathered from that heist and a new one needs to be sent out. All levels offer multiple approaches through the tools and abilities. Doors can be opened or closed, many elements can be hacked and custom passages can be created with bombs. Each location introduces new elements to levels and new types of enemies that need to be analyzed. When the thief is spotted, the alarms are sounded right away. All enemies then become much faster and more aggressive. The funds in the levels are then also drained gradually to move them elsewhere. The thief can however still finish the level by returning to the pod, but has to watch out for a powerful police character that soon arrives. It has some roguelike elements (character permadeath, random levels), but perks are permanent and carried over to a new thief as long as there are days left. Perks are also bought specifically and are not offered from a random selection.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Platform; Stealth","Developer":"Size Five Games","Publisher":"Curve Digital","ReleaseDate":"2015-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":194016,"FileName":"9d07b669-892e-410c-9fcc-2fe7bf115a31.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203299,"Name":"The Tower of Beatrice","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The life of a thief isn’t easy: always hiding in shadows, clients cheat, traps bite…\n\nWorking on a contract for a mysterious client, you'll need to infiltrate the tower of the powerful sorcerer Beatrice, steal her Book of Recipes, and get out alive.\n\nAlong the way you will enter a demon's dreams to discover his most intimate desires, accept a gift from a Granny-spider, start the Clock Tower, feed a snail, make a tea for a demon, piece together a skeleton, and finally fix your own fatal failing.\n\nFeatures:\n- Six floors – each with its own atmosphere and mood\n\n- Surprising and charming residents – demons of Fire, Frost and Dream, Iron Maiden, Hungry Chest, and many others\n\n- Alchemy!

It's a new adventure to explore when you don't have more friends handy to square off against.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Matt Thorson","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2015-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203298,"FileName":"bc429790-5791-491e-855d-bc005042b572.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203298,"FileName":"e1ba109c-db26-4659-a276-2621a7e8d7dd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203217,"Name":"Toy Story 4","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":101799,"Name":"Treasures of Montezuma Arena","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fight to survive!

He orchestrates the death of his own son, but his grandson Areus is saved by his elven mother. Areus grows up and swears revenge against his grandfather, attempting to become the country's most powerful gladiator to achieve his goal.\n\nTrinity: Souls of Zill O'll is a prequel to Zill O'll, depicting the events that led to Balor's demise. Unlike its predecessor, it is an action role-playing game. The player controls a party of three characters - Areus himself, the female warrior Selene of the vampire-like Darkenith tribe, and Dagda of the Boldan race of giants. The player can directly control only one character at a time, but it is possible to switch between them instantly and initiate combo attacks that way. The three can also perform a powerful attack together when certain conditions are met. Battle environments are destructible and spells physically affect the entire area rather than just the characters.\n\nLike in the previous game, sub-quests are available in town guilds, and the player can opt to tackle them in a different order. The character affinity system, however, is not present, and the player is unable to create an own character or choose between different initial scenarios.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202737,"Name":"Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The United States sends generation ships to nearby star systems to find new planets to colonize.

It is an updated version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The game was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was featured as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in 2012.\n\nIn Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. As an update, the game utilizes largely identical gameplay mechanics to the original. However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustments. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aesthetic changes.\n\nAfter the events of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9OqbiRLaho","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"8fde83ce-07cb-4aab-a6fd-decf81c388bf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"ce515143-d739-4384-a0c0-dec223963bb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"07b5c245-cd3f-438f-be10-79d519593289.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"8fb22420-155d-4766-80a1-640f7e625ec5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"23c67145-d48d-4907-8ad8-d90a2dec8ccd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"cc21d144-3d3d-4ad5-87c1-b27af78c50df.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"7b0ee382-1dcc-4fe1-96e6-505371088929.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"6318b339-242e-4ddf-a973-95a7b8543120.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"2970db99-a36b-4770-b2d8-c06c40907e50.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"b96c7d4e-90fd-4201-b6a4-6a0d265f4c7c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"077e947f-8937-4a53-97ba-dbe459608754.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"191a2328-8d29-40e8-8528-b81aec6f477f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"13f02282-b1cc-4322-beba-9e05ce95ff77.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"c13adce1-abc4-4702-8e51-18f47d6da41f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"bfb58bbe-312b-4ef1-8c73-e34124d1b691.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"c5ccf449-8731-4c32-baad-a297faba6d35.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"f410b97a-4550-49e1-90ac-7242bc5987c4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"8c8c4ced-f2e2-4704-9c41-e6210df6d930.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"b3abab9a-c965-4dde-a129-32e0403c6250.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"6ee0476c-495b-466e-a111-eb9b6c0bbdfc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"506ee652-9a48-4022-8b78-8209d53d15ed.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"d9d64821-4715-4e98-b4f2-209a18185899.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"bc8aa5df-37df-4e50-a0a7-dafdb86a92c8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"8839f93e-75ea-4f82-a260-bdd62656780d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"5ae477b8-ce5c-4255-a0a6-5c404cbed956.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12463,"FileName":"f8bc6cfd-7111-4552-bb01-62e60aa22e23.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203123,"Name":"Ultracore","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Strictly Limited Games","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2020-07-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203123,"FileName":"875eb7c7-be05-474d-b9f2-60d9cac7ca07.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203123,"FileName":"498f5582-363e-4045-8e0e-32d791ecb8b6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203124,"Name":"Ultratron","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The last human has been slain by evil killer robots.

Each Faction card can be equipped with powerful Resource and valuable Fortune cards, which enhance their stats and give them special abilities.

The first type of level is a top-down shooter with puzzle elements controlling her Quarp Jet. These sections are similar to the gameplay of the previous games. Rather than a pure shoot'em up it focuses on the ship's movement, combined with rescuing survivors, shooting enemies and obstacles using a pulse cannon, dropping strategic bombs, solving small puzzles for instance based on switches, and using the series' trademark teleportation technique to quickly hop between fenced off areas. There is also a powerful boost function to move quickly as getting a very fast time is rewarded.\n\nOn the other hand there are 2D side-scrolling platforming sections that are an entirely new element for the series. They are accessed by docking during the top-down flying sections, briefly solving a puzzle to remove a barrier for instance, but they can also form entire levels. Just like the flying sections these levels focus on quick movement and also incorporate teleportation through the ability to launch telepods and a very quick teledash. In the side-scrolling levels Kai Tana can run, jump, glide, collect rekenium shards and needs to avoid dangerous surfaces. While running she can shoot in any direction. Both types of levels have multiple checkpoints. To fully complete a level and earn the maximum amount of experience, multiple objectives need to be completed, such as a fast completion time, scoring a high amount of points, and rescuing all survivors (flying) or gathering all crystals (running).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGsrGmIWxV0","Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"FuturLab Ltd.","Publisher":"Futurlab Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"6a2e4a21-7034-4d64-9605-ca9175660362.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"8f7cdeff-4530-45f6-a48c-7023d3018771.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"cccd9114-80b3-48ce-9c56-95451e837534.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"1f8c67b9-e94a-456e-8194-78fd5f237dec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"00479a42-a6b6-4ac2-861a-bf439a62ea97.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"45ca7f20-e437-403c-a161-c97b3ab86527.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"851e19da-dad0-4368-a339-3c712dd3d726.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23192,"FileName":"1dbfe1af-81db-4e44-8475-f654270d899a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21559,"Name":"Velocity Ultra","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Velocity is a shoot 'em up video game developed by FuturLab for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita as a PlayStation mini.

He is a thief who finds a device called Volume that is a military training simulator, but allows users to simulate heists in virtual worlds as well. The game opens showing how Locksley is discovered and captured. It then rewinds three hours and 100 missions explain what happened before. Locksley broadcasts his simulated heists over the internet for anyone to match and finds an antagonist in Guy Gisborne, CEO of Gisborne Industries, who has also taken over the country of England. More of the story and the background is revealed through notes found during missions. Volume also has artificial intelligence called Alan who guides Locksley through the mechanics and has conversations about events while the missions are in progress.\n\nThe game is played from an elevated, almost top-down perspective and consists of short, maze-like levels. To complete a level Locksley needs to collect all gems and then the exit opens up. Levels are guarded by characters called Pawns. They are stationary or patrol and it is possible to see their line of sight through a cone. When they discover Locksley they go after him and shoot. The level then has to be restarted unless a checkpoint has been activated first. There are no means to kill opponents, so strategy is always about distractions and staying unnoticed. Locksley can cling to walls, with slower movement, but at the same time ducking slightly to stay out of sight when near lower objects. The game moves to a completely top-down perspective at that time and it is possible to hop between walls around corners. He can also move in any direction while walking regularly.\n\nThe initial approach to distract guards is by whistling, but eventually many types of gadgets are introduced. Gadgets can only be used when they are present in levels. The first one introduced is the Bugle that can be fired in any direction. When it is set off, also in flight, it makes a sound that draws attention. The Oddity has similar mechanics, but can only be shot at a high wall, where it will attract the attention of a guard for some time when it is spotted. Mute gives a temporary speed boost and mutes the sound of pressure plates. Gadgets generally take some time to recharge, but can be used without limits. During levels only one gadget can be carried at a time. Locksley can also flush toilets or run water taps to create sounds, and he can hide in closets behind doors.\n\nAdvanced levels include new types of opponents such as turrets, and hounds with a 180 degrees line of sight. Guards will often activate alarms alerting the others when Locksley is spotted. They will then run much faster and it can only be averted by hiding for a while or hacking the security system to disable the alarm. Some levels have pressure plates that make a sound and sometimes there are forcefields blocking the path that require some time to deactivate. Levels do not always have a single solution and can often be solved in different ways.\n\nThe game includes an editor that allows users to create and share custom levels online. It is also possible to edit and remix the existing levels.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mike Bithell","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"ef7a6cdb-7bcb-4ce1-a7e1-1f449854d8b2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"5cae3918-acaa-4404-8e03-138160140d89.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"d7d93ab5-bb20-4e35-a131-b84ad135ebfa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"cfba88b7-114c-42bf-9a9c-f9c969df6487.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"e8f78120-be1c-4afd-bd58-ea1fa998f81b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"ec3b955f-f112-47ae-973f-13cb9af3897f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"f586ff32-9e43-4066-9b17-5799c5abf6c9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31307,"FileName":"8ceea0b9-c7c0-4b8b-ab57-4ec130990bdd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203100,"Name":"Vostok Inc.","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Vostok Inc. is a casual game for a hardcore audience and a hardcore game for a casual audience.

You and an opponent face off in an arena with a low net in the middle. Points are scored by throwing a disc into the goals behind a player or whenever your opponent is not able to catch the disc in time. There are two moves: a regular throw and a lob. By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly.\n\nThere are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds. The game is won after two winning sets or sudden death after two draws.\n\nFor the futuristic touch, signature moves are added. To charge these special moves, you need to block, toss or lob the disc and then charge while the disc is in the air. These moves can be countered and sometimes they knock an opponent into the goal.\n\nTwo mini-games are included in-between levels: play fetch with a dog and Flying Disc Bowling.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Sports","Developer":"Data East Corporation","Publisher":"DotEmu","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":194017,"FileName":"e59c6d20-2d71-48c5-88ef-0a090b8ba564.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3924,"Name":"WipEout 2048","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Wipeout 2048 players experience the thrill and speed of aggressive, antigravity racing in the palm of their hand via the PlayStation Vita.

Returning to a more traditional gameplay style from earlier Final Fantasy titles, it revolves around turn-based battles which utilize the series' recurring Active Time Battle system, augmented with a stacking mechanic where stacking allied characters and monsters affects stats and turn numbers. An enhanced edition, called World of Final Fantasy Maxima, was released on November 6, 2018, and has have avatar change to transform into a classic Final Fantasy character.\n\nWorld of Final Fantasy is primarily set in the world of Grymoire, a land populated by classic Final Fantasy characters and monsters from across the series, while being unconnected to any other series entry. The storyline focuses on twin siblings Lann and Reynn, who suffer from amnesia and hold the power in one of their arms to capture and wield Mirages, the monsters of Grymoire. Lann and Reynn travel to Grymoire to recover their memories, gradually mastering their powers and becoming involved in the conflicts consuming the world - these include fights between rival factions within the native Lilikins, and the impending threat of the Bahamutian Army.\n\nDevelopment started around the concept of a Final Fantasy title aimed at a wider and younger audience, focusing on a light tone and stylised graphics compared to the mainline entries. It was directed by Hiroki Chiba, who had worked as a scenario writer and event planner for the series and also wrote the scenario for World of Final Fantasy. The chibi character designs, which had been used for Pictlogica Final Fantasy, were created by Yasuhisa Izumisawa; the larger characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The music was composed primarily by Masashi Hamauzu, who also included arranged versions of classic themes while aiming for the music to be lighter in tone.\n\nFirst announced at the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, World of Final Fantasy was intended as a celebratory title to commemorate the series' 30th anniversary. A worldwide release was planned from an early stage, with localization running parallel to the development and Japanese voice recording. In order to keep the characters true to their original appearances, the localization staff who first handled them were brought in to translate their dialogue.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sony Playstation Vita","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Square Enix Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164650,"FileName":"eb98f544-c0c3-4a9f-bbff-77bd091ac4c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164650,"FileName":"281668b9-071f-4f74-844f-90a72c0936fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164650,"FileName":"c536aabe-d8e5-4b96-9e1e-61d3cdc37e71.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164650,"FileName":"3bdbaad0-16ff-4eb0-91ef-bb57123ac01d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164650,"FileName":"6d5b0c37-834c-4be4-8b82-68eee4a713a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184467,"Name":"Worms Revolution Extreme","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This special edition of Worms Revolution comes packed with the base game, and the three downloadable packs: Funfair Pack, Mars Pack, Medieval Tales Pack.\n\nIt also includes a new mode called \"Treasure Mode\" in which you can link up with players on the PlayStation 3 version.

These characters venture to the sinister Darm Tower, each having her or his own motives. The three also vary in gameplay style: Yunica plays similarly to Adol from the previous games, specializing in melee combat with swords and axes; Hugo fires magical bullets with his staff and has access to other types of magic; The Claw is distinguished by his speed in close combat.\n\nThe game is set entirely in the Darm Tower, discarding the overworld and populated areas of the previous games. The fast-paced action RPG gameplay is similar to the one adopted in Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim and Ys: The Oath in Felghana. As the story progresses, characters acquire skills that can be combined in order to extend battle strategy.
