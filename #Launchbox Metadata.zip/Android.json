To escape, the player must earn 10,000,000 points in a single run through the dungeon.

These resources can be used to level up the character, which can impact how the sliding puzzle is played and its results on the dungeon run.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPlkZRqnxUQ","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"EightyEight Games","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-03-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25601,"FileName":"92f53434-89aa-4170-8033-716904ca30dd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30701,"Name":"2-bit Cowboy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"2-bit Cowboy is a Western action platformer game, styled after classics of the Gameboy era.\n'I've got confidence that 2-bit Cowboy will deliver that faux-retro platforming experience I love so much' -Touch Arcade\n\n'2-bit Cowboy is every bit the lost Gameboy title you want it to be' -Gamezebo\n\nThere's a new sheriff in this 2-bit town: you!

It is a 3D remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, the first game in the Mana series. It was released worldwide for Android and iOS on February 4, 2016; a PlayStation Vita version was also released on the same date in Japan, and in June 2016 in North America and Europe. In addition to these releases, Square Enix is considering developing a PlayStation 4 version.\n\nThe player takes the role of a young hero who, together with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on sword combat, and is seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies.\n\nThe idea for the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern platforms for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake should be done in 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it could be used as a base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some calling it a better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Square Enix","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166731,"FileName":"771e7174-2720-4a5c-8b07-81b12bd19f53.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166149,"Name":"AFK Arena","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Lilith Games","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166149,"FileName":"021ad6ab-f792-4e26-997b-286f142fe33e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":166149,"FileName":"9a79fbe4-ceaa-43f8-a79d-fe08d876bd76.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":166149,"FileName":"65c072ca-7628-4958-bd09-e84f4218c99b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166149,"FileName":"fac4cff6-ebc0-4092-a36c-61a761e4d290.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34520,"Name":"Age of Ishtaria","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mix up devastating attacks to create your own combos!

Autobirds, ROLL OUT!\n\nThe objective in the game is to complete a run from start to finish in each stage, dealing with Pigbots attacking both Autobirds and Deceptihogs alike. Popping pigs is not needed to finish any stage; popped pigs are used to unlock new characters who are encased in ice. To pop the pigs, players must either directly shoot at them, or destroy their fortresses to crush them or make them fall from great heights.\n\nPlayers can also transform to speed through a level faster and avoid highly damaging falling monoliths. As players upgrade their Transformers, they get special Energon abilities that can be recharged by shooting roboticized environmental objects to release Energon cubes.\n\nPlayers can also bring an ally (even from a different faction) into a stage, where they can be summoned to assist the player for a set amount of time. If Astrotrain flies over you after your partner has disappeared, then he can no longer help you complete the level before returning to Astrotrain. However, if your partner is still present when Astrotrain flies over you, then he will remain with you until you and him both return to Astrotrain. Players' health is represented by five hearts made of five lines (4% health) representing 20% of health. If you lose all of your health points, you will fail the level and Astrotrain will beam your beaten-up Transformer away from the event, followed by a spotlight shining down on the beaten-up Transformer inside his cab on the Game Over screen with the word \"Unlucky!\" appearing over him.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Rovio Entertainment Ltd.","Publisher":"Rovio Entertainment Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":200689,"FileName":"204e3cad-b47f-4f33-a4f2-9b9ad1bcdb14.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200689,"FileName":"5bba5e57-d291-469b-b508-8801488213bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200689,"FileName":"f1f97e75-551f-4562-80fb-5dfba92299cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200689,"FileName":"006fbafc-211f-4a91-b3af-a36dc3decdd3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200689,"FileName":"ac874cc1-ead8-4431-a3a7-d5dd6f95ccad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200689,"FileName":"09d7a481-8455-488a-bc0e-4c31bfe403fa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":160194,"Name":"Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is a free-to-play social simulation mobile game in Nintendo's Animal Crossing series for iOS and Android devices.

Humanity crushed between a clash for untold dominance between the Absolutes, disorder, pain, and death befell mortals. All anyone could do was await death, but even that was quickly snatched away from the frail hands of man. In the end, perpetual strife and madness pervaded. Dangerous shadows stalk the grounds of the ruins, waiting to pounce on any living being, to lay blame and judgement. It is a kind of Purgatory we [the players] are in. There is no hope here, but for the end. Oblivion (hinted in Ire - Blood Memory) is what we seek.\n\nThe identity of the narrator in the introduction is ambiguous. The narrator knows of the aforementioned — the tragedy and sorrow to befall this frail world. She is removed... perhaps, reluctant. There is a sense of resignation, an understanding that an end to this version of the world is best. Here all possibilities and realms interlace, and, as you know... rot must be cut away. As the narrator awaits the end, perhaps she beckons us to bring forth that end.\n\nAnimus is a high-end Action RPG that offers superb graphics, incredible sound and music, and responsive combat controls. Player level and equipment progression have been streamlined so that players can jump into the punishment. Hours of challenging and rewarding gameplay are guaranteed in this tense screen crusher.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAnimus places the gamer into the role of a solitary warrior who must fight his way through a dark and desolate world full of horrific monsters. The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles.\n\nLeveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area.\n\nPlayers are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far.\n\nThe type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tenbirds","Publisher":"Tenbirds","ReleaseDate":"2018-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165373,"FileName":"5c2d925d-a5ea-4009-93b9-a551c01c7e01.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165373,"FileName":"5b38daa6-53f9-4264-ae0a-939f9b42c7f5.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30706,"Name":"Anodyne","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Explore and fight your way through nature, urban and abstract themed areas in the human Young's subconscious, evoked by a 16-bit-era visual style and a moody, dream-like soundtrack.\n\nAnodyne is a full-length adventure created by Sean Hogan (programming, music) and Jonathan Kittaka (artwork, writing), and is now available on your Android device.

It is a variation on their browser game Candy Crush.[1]\n\n\nDifferent \"special candies\" can be formed by matching a combination of 4 or 5 in a certain formation, such as a \"Striped\" candy (which clears either an entire row or column), a \"Wrapped\" candy (which acts like a bomb; clearing the 8 surrounding candies, falling, and exploding one more time), or a \"Color Bomb\" (which removes all candies with the same color of the one it is matched with). Special Candies can also be matched together, producing varying effects; for example, matching a color bomb with a striped candy turns all of the candies of its color into striped candies, which are immediately detonated.\n\nOther special candies which appear on the boards for free can be purchased from the in-game store, or won from the Candy Crush Booster Wheel. These include Jelly Fish in jelly clearing boards which clear 3 pieces from the board at random, the Coconut Wheel on ingredient dropping boards which changes three candies in a row into striped candies, and Lucky Candy in recipe boards which when matched change to one of the types of pieces the player needs to clear the objective. The Booster Wheel also offers a chance to win a jackpot of all boosters in one spin.\n\nOther pieces known as Blockers appear on boards to add to the challenge: Icing (also called Meringues) cannot be moved and can only be removed by matching next to it, Liquorice Locks cage of single pieces of candy to prevent them from use, Chocolate pieces will multiply if not cleared, Liquorice Swirls cannot be removed with Special Candies, Candy Bombs will explode and end the level early if they are not cleared, Multilayered Icing requires multiple matches to remove, Chocolate Spawners will produce Chocolate pieces at all times, Marmalade guards Special Candies from use, Cake Bombs can clear the entire board once cleared, and Toffee Tornadoes move on the board destroying pieces and shattering the tile beneath them to prevent use for one turn. Other pieces also appear on levels such as Chameleon Candies which switch colors every turn, Mystery Candies which randomly turn into a Special Candy or a Blocker, and Extra Time Candies on time limit levels.\n\nThe player can also purchase various Boosters to attempt to win levels more easily or extend play after a lost level; Lollipop Hammer clears a single piece from the board, Extra Moves can be purchased if running out of moves at the end of a game, Free Switch allows players to switch two pieces that do not possibly match, Sweet Teeth to clear out Blockers and Jelly, Bomb Coolers to add onto Candy Bomb timers if the timer runs out, and the Bubblegum Troll to stop Chocolate Spawners from spawning chocolate from its sides. The Dreamworld levels have their own special boosters: the Restore Balance booster to reset the Moon Scale for 5 turns and the Moon Struck booster to automatically activate Moon Struck.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJjCGmMkAIw","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"King","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22632,"FileName":"bc73da56-e74d-4c01-b05b-231596713702.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22632,"FileName":"7f39fa19-934f-4ef5-a333-7f3068d5081d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22632,"FileName":"7ccf333a-93e1-4be7-9094-dd3e92da4490.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34526,"Name":"Candy Crush Soda Saga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Candy Crush Soda Saga is described by the developer as a variant of Candy Crush Saga and not a sequel.

Chrono Trigger '​s development team included three designers that Square dubbed the \"Dream Team\": Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of Square's Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, a freelance designer and creator of Enix's popular Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, a freelance manga artist famed for his work with Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball. Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game,[6] Masato Kato wrote most of the plot, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda scored most of the game before falling ill and deferring the remaining tracks to Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu.[3][7] The game's story follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nSquare re-released a ported version by Tose in Japan for Sony's PlayStation in 1999, later repackaged with a Final Fantasy IV port as Final Fantasy Chronicles in 2001 for the North American market. A slightly enhanced Chrono Trigger, again ported by Tose, was released for the Nintendo DS on November 25, 2008, in North America and Japan, and went on sale in Australia on February 3, 2009 and in Europe on February 6, 2009.[8] The game was never released in PAL territories before the Nintendo DS version.\n\nChrono Trigger was a critical and commercial success upon release and is frequently cited as one of the best video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[9] Chrono Trigger was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PlayStation iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003.[10][11] The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009.[12] Chrono Trigger was also ported to mobile phones,[13] Virtual Console,[14] the PlayStation Network,[15] iOS devices,[16] and Android devices.[17]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"SQUARE ENIX Co.,Ltd.","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":26732,"FileName":"a3864f9a-1010-46b9-9dc8-61de2d19918b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26732,"FileName":"873f4a79-216f-48b9-b488-5d5bbe68a8cc.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26977,"Name":"Circle the Dot","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This is a simple game with simple rules.

Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.\n\nProgress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.\n\nUnleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.\n\nEach hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.\n\nOnce your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades.

It is an isometric game, inspired by some of the best role-playing games from the past decades; it brings back the old spirit of the classics in many ways: a challenging environment, choices with consequences, and a solid game system, with different paths to develop your character.\n\nExplore the world: no one will point you to the best hidden secrets. Talk to hundreds of different characters, each with unique dialogues, and solve dozens of quests. Customize your character with dozens of skills and hundreds of different items. Overcome all kind of monsters and antagonists, choosing carefully the weapons or powers for each encounter. And return to the classical dungeon crawl, with traps and secret doors, and death awaiting the unwary adventurer behind every corner.\n\nIncludes 135 areas, 90 quests (plus randomly generated quests), over 400 dialogues, counting over 130,000 words; approximately 120+ hours of gameplay. Additionally, the full version unlocks the Iron-Man mode (permadeath) and makes the Cleric and Mage classes available.\n\nStory introduction: A dark tale, and a brave new world\n\nA century ago, the Andorian Empire was destroyed by a magical cataclysm that brought The Horrors into our world; humanity was nearly annihilated. Many thousands managed to escape sailing away to the Imperial Colony of Varannar: a savage island, dangerous and unexplored. Mistrust and blame made impossible to elect a new Emperor, and the four Exiled Kingdoms were proclaimed.\n\nNowadays, the ragtag kingdoms still struggle to survive in a harsh land, often waging war on each other. Empire and the Horrors are, for many, just old legends and fairytales. You are a novice adventurer, rarely paying attention to such old stories; you're more concerned with your latest misadventures and lack of gold.\n\nBut for once, luck seems to be on your side. You received a letter from New Garand, stating that you are the sole beneficiary of a big inheritance. You don’t remember any relatives in the capital of the Kingdom of Varsilia, but certainly that won’t stop you from an opportunity like this! The road to New Garand will reveal many surprises, and will teach you that fairytales and legends can become, in fact, very real.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"4 Dimension Games","Publisher":"4 Dimension Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166786,"FileName":"3724e473-db44-4295-82fa-41fb6013dfa9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166435,"Name":"Exiles","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From the creators of the award winning Ravensword: Shadowlands comes EXILES, a beautiful Sci-Fi 3D role playing game that takes place on a distant world.\n\nIn the near future, a colony on a distant planet has been driven to isolation and desolation, as a corrupt government tries to enslave it with a lethal virus.\n\nBecome one of the Elite Enforcers, and go on various missions that will unravel the secrets behind the plot to enslave the world.

Trees must also be watered before they will produce fruit.\nHarvested crops and other resources no longer immediately credit the player with coins; rather, they go to the player's inventory. These stored resources can then be sold for coins or used to craft goods. Most crops (but not crafted goods or animal resources) can also be used to make animal feed, which must be given to animals in order that they will produce resources.\nFarmVille 2: Country Escape\nFarmVille 2: Country Escape for mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows operating systems) was released on April 10, 2014, and received a positive review from The New York Times. Unlike other games in the FarmVille series, FarmVille 2: Country Escape can be played offline.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Zynga","Publisher":"Zynga","ReleaseDate":"2014-04-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22616,"FileName":"64c29dd6-c131-4234-a05f-2b16db2314c6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22616,"FileName":"12e10659-5258-4ac7-9fb7-371a682e58a3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22616,"FileName":"83b343f7-146f-409c-86bc-8571e6d8637c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22616,"FileName":"e23c7b83-32fe-442c-ae2e-307c63824586.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132151,"Name":"Fate/Grand Order","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A new mobile \"Fate RPG,\" presented by TYPE-MOON!\nWith an impressive main scenario and multiple character quests, \nthe game features millions of words of original story!\nPacked with content that both fans of the Fate franchise and newcomers will be able to enjoy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMx3LY-ZMXs","Platform":"Android","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"DELiGHTWORKS","Publisher":"Aniplex Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2017-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":132151,"FileName":"e20c6df8-ce02-4890-a2f8-d1e89c294ef8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":132151,"FileName":"c9bf266d-e0ef-44ac-a40d-d2e2742e9cfb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":132151,"FileName":"06c0bab1-fe4c-497e-aed3-d1d9ad81b72e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":132151,"FileName":"8963c712-7227-4547-ae9a-55a9ee60dab1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30254,"Name":"Feed Me Oil 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Feed Me Oil is a physics-based puzzle game developed by HolyWaterGames for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices.

The game uses the Active Time Battle system in which a character's turn are determined by a gauge that fills over time during battle. Once the gauge fills completely from one character, players can choose a command from that specific character. After choosing a command, the gauge fills over again to execute the command. Once the gauge fills again and the command is executed, the gauge empties and repeats the cycle. Similar to Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, the game was released in an episodic format, but players must play through each episode in sequence. Players command a party of five with the party members changing in each episode.\n\nThe game uses a Job System similar to Final Fantasy V as a base of its battles. The game allows players to change job while still retaining skills that have already been acquired. Job-specific abilities can be learned after crossing a certain amount of AP for the current job given. That learned ability can be set even if the player changes to a different job. Players are limited in how many abilities they can set at a given time. This limit rises as the job's level rises. The game also has \"Fusion Abilities\" which players can form by setting combinations of certain abilities.\n\nThe Jobs available from the beginning for all the eight main characters are Freelancer, Warrior, Monk, Thief, Red Mage, White Mage, Black Mage, and Summoner. Each episode introduces a new Job, which is unlocked after completing the episode. The unlockable jobs for the Warriors of Light are Dragoon, Bard, Memorist, Paladin, and Seer, while the jobs unlocked for the Warriors of Darkness are Ranger, Dark Knight, Dancer, Ninja, and Magus.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Matrix Software","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2012-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165386,"FileName":"70320244-4353-4356-a0e4-ad68aaac958c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165387,"Name":"Final Fantasy Dimensions II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The latest title of the Final Fantasy Dimensions series that has achieved three million downloads worldwide!\n\nA journey that links the past to the future!\n\n◆◇Game Introduction◇◆\nA fascinating cast of characters of different races and eras.\nAn incredible story that leads you through the past and future to save the world.\nCombine your strengths to defeat powerful foes in intense battles.\nFinal Fantasy Dimensions II is an RPG that brings a new legend to the world of FF.\n\n▼A great adventure that transcends time and space\nOur hero Morrow and heroine Aemo travel through the present, past, and future and gain allies along the way on their great quest to save the world.\n\n▼Abilities and summon magic\nBattle monsters with a simple and strategic active command system!\nSelect from abilities like magic, skills, and powerful summons to battle terrifying enemies and emerge victorious!\n\n▼Crystals that house the power of the Eidolons\nEquip and fight with crystals known as signet stones to acquire new abilities for your characters.\nMany of these signet stones possess the powers of summoned beasts from throughout the history of the FF series!\n\n◆◇Story◇◆\nThe eastern continent of Ajima and the western continent of Westa.\nA great disaster caused by human error destroys the civilization of magic that prospered during the Ancient Era and divides the world into east and west, ushering in a long period of conflict between the two.\nA young boy named Morrow who lives in Navos, a small island at the center of the world, loses himself listening to tales of Wrieg's travels, a Westan adventurer.\nMorrow follows Wrieg after he senses something strange from an odd shooting star and meets a mysterious girl from the future named Aemo.\nThe world of Eidola exists outside the present, past, future, and beyond.\nSay hello and farewell to friends of different eras in a story about a promise for a better future.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Matrix Software","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2017-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165387,"FileName":"3e97d3ce-710b-4419-b5eb-005eedc29668.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23400,"Name":"Final Fantasy II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The highly anticipated follow-up to the original FINAL FANTASY, released in Japan in 1988, FINAL FANTASY II features the bitter and beautiful tale of four war-orphaned heroes who become embroiled in the conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance.

Released in 1994, it is the sixth title in the mainline Final Fantasy series. Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series.\n\nIt was ported by Tose with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation in 1999 and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance in 2006, and it was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan in March 15, 2011, followed by the PAL region on March 18, 2011 and North America on June 30, 2011. The game was known as Final Fantasy III when it was first released in North America, as the original Final Fantasy III and Final Fantasy V had not been released outside Japan at the time (leaving IV as the second title released outside of Japan and VI as the third). However, most later localizations used the original title. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI was released to critical acclaim and is seen as a landmark title for the role-playing genre; for instance, it was ranked as the number one RPG of all time by IGN.[1] Its Super Nintendo and PlayStation versions have sold over 3.48 million copies worldwide to date as a stand-alone game, as well as over 750,000 copies as part of the Japanese Final Fantasy Collection and the North American Final Fantasy Anthology.

The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. \n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! \n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's? \n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4UTOek0-Y","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Horror","Developer":"Scott Cawthon","Publisher":"Scott Cawthon","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27860,"FileName":"9d175c25-c55c-4c90-8fc3-a2aaf02f0c9d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25962,"Name":"Five Nights at Freddy's 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters.

Developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on November 16, 2004, following a five-year $40 million development, during which a substantial part of the project was leaked and distributed on the Internet. The game was developed alongside Valve's Steam software. It introduced the Source game engine and, because of Steam, was the first single-player video game to require online product activation.\n\nSome years after the events of Half-Life, protagonist Gordon Freeman is woken by the enigmatic G-Man to find the world has been taken over by the alien Combine. Joined by allies including resistance fighter Alyx Vance, Gordon searches for a way to free humanity using a variety of weapons, including the object-manipulating gravity gun.\n\nLike its predecessor, Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim. It was praised for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative. The game won 39 \"Game of the Year\" awards and the title of \"Game Of The Decade\" at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards. Over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 were sold at retail by December 3, 2008, (not including Steam sales); as of February 9, 2011, Half-Life 2 had sold over 12 million copies. Half-Life 2 is considered one of the greatest video games of all time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haAL8b3iKG8","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"NVIDIA SHIELD Partners","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31356,"FileName":"a5014e3a-6844-4157-93ec-16618b068265.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31356,"FileName":"44c75897-e7b1-44d8-9bf3-9c05af505663.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31356,"FileName":"b82f11ae-561b-4fc5-9d33-2444aa8d0b3f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31356,"FileName":"a6ab6ac0-5083-46d4-b938-1d0222c98a3e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31366,"Name":"Half-Life 2: Episode One","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter video game, the first in a series of episodes that serve as the sequel for the 2004 Half-Life 2.

Originally called Half-Life 2: Aftermath, the game was later renamed to Episode One after Valve became confident in using an episodic structure for the game. Similar to Half-Life 2, Episode One also uses the Source game engine. The game debuted new lighting and animation technologies, as well as AI sidekick enhancements.\n\nThe game's events take place immediately after those in Half-Life 2, in and around war-torn City 17. Episode One follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his companion Alyx Vance as they fight in humanity's continuing struggle against the transhuman race known as the Combine. When the story begins, Gordon wakes up outside the enemy's base of operations, the Citadel, after being left unconscious from the concluding events of Half-Life 2. During the course of the game, Gordon travels with Alyx as they attempt to evacuate the city. As the game comes to an end, Gordon and Alyx are caught in a major accident, and their fates are revealed in the sequel, Episode Two.\n\nValve views episodes One through Three as tantamount to a standalone release. Episode One is available as part of a bundle package known as The Orange Box, which also includes Half-Life 2, Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Episode One received a generally positive critical reaction, and the co-operative aspects of the gameplay received particular praise but its short length was criticized.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"NVIDIA SHIELD Partners","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31366,"FileName":"8e58c799-76cb-4845-8d3d-6e3f06e0305b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31366,"FileName":"c9af0a83-5f5d-415e-ae5e-2892ce352f11.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31366,"FileName":"40669b3b-d91d-41b7-865a-5cc3a9010d5a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31366,"FileName":"b3c643c5-b4d7-4149-a8d3-204931bc268e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31482,"Name":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two is a first-person shooter video game, the second episode in a series of sequels to the 2004 Half-Life 2.

The game was first released exclusively for Android devices on November 15, 2012,[2][5] and was made available for Apple's iOS on July 14, 2014.[3][6] The game has a complex science fiction back story with a continuous open narrative,[7][8] which however is not necessary for playing and enjoying the game. Ingress has also been considered to be a location-based exergame.[9]\n\nThe gameplay consists of capturing \"portals\" at places of cultural significance, such as public art, landmarks, monuments, etc., and linking them to create virtual triangular \"control fields\" over geographical areas. Progress in the game is measured by the number of \"mind units\" (MUs) captured via such control fields, i.e. people nominally controlled by each faction (as illustrated on the Intel Map).[10][11] The necessary links between portals may range in length from meters to kilometers or hundreds of kilometers, created in operations of considerable logistical complexity.[12] International links and fields are not uncommon, as Ingress has attracted an enthusiastic following in cities worldwide[13] amongst both young and old,[14] to the extent that the gameplay is itself a lifestyle for some, including tattoos.[2] Gameplay relies heavily on the player physically moving about the community in order to interact with portals. Playing in a vehicle is possible, but increases in speed disable some features of the game, both for safety reasons and in order to encourage physical activity.\n\nIn addition to the main interactive map, called the Scanner, players also have access to a \"COMM\" tab that displays local and regional, even worldwide, live activity going on within the game, such as faction progress and activity, in-game communication, and alerts.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"NianticLabs@Google","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22637,"FileName":"0b9ff8ca-cab8-45c2-bf90-9db3fcd1a2a5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23183,"Name":"Injustice: Gods Among Us","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting video game based upon the fictional universe of DC Comics. The game was developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. It was released in April 2013 in North America, Europe, and Australia, and June 2013 in Japan. An expanded version of the game, titled Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition, was released in November 2013 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. A free-to-play mobile app based on Injustice was also released for Android and iOS devices.\n\nPlayers select one of several characters from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent. The game is set in a 2.5D environment; while character models and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters are restricted to fight within a two-dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.\n\nThe storyline is set within an alternate version of the Justice League's universe. Superman establishes a new world order after the Joker tricks him into killing Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. In an effort to stop Superman, Batman summons members of the Justice League from the mainstream continuity to join his insurgency and end the totalitarian regime. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, gameplay mechanics, and use of the DC Comics license. Injustice became the highest selling game in the United States and United Kingdom during the month of its release. The game also won several awards for \"Best Fighting Game\" in 2013.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Warner Bros.

It was developed by Square Enix Montréal as a spiritual successor to its 2014 Hitman Go, based on another Square Enix franchise. Lara Croft Go strips the main elements of the series into simple elements, for example, urgent quick time events into floors that crack after each turn.

The player is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. whose task is to defeat super villains and recover ISO-8, crystal fragments that have been raining down on Earth from a deep space location. The game consists of missions, battles and trading cards with other players.\n\nBy performing missions the player earns experience, cash (in the form of silver) and cards. Each operation in the game consists of five missions and ends with an encounter with a super villain. Each mission works the same, as the player kills numerous defenceless bad guys before his progress bar fills up. Each attack costs energy and once the energy bar is empty the player can not progress further. He then needs to wait for it to recharge or use an energy pack that can be either earned or bought in the store. For each kill the player gains experience and when his XP bar is full he levels up. For each level up the player gets one attribute point that can be used to upgrade three different stats: energy, attack and defense. From missions the player can also earn resources and by collecting six resources of the same kind a special award is earned.\n\nThe player will get access to numerous cards each representing a super hero. They are awarded in missions or acquired through packs as well as by trading with other players. The quality of a card is based on its rarity. When fighting super villains the player uses his primary card. Cards have stats in the form of attack, defense and card XP. These stats can be raised by boosting and fusing cards and by gaining higher mastery levels. Cards also have one of three alignments: speed, bruiser or tactics. Boosting cards means sacrificing some cards to make one card stronger. Bad cards can thereby be used to enhance the best cards. Fusing cards involves combining two identical cards to produce a more powerful card.\n\nBattles are done with other players and by winning the player can steal money and resources. Decks of up to five cards are used and the player has both an attack deck and a defense deck. A battle starts when the player selects another player to attack. The attack strength of the player will then be compared to the defense strength of his opponent and if it's higher the attacker will win. Some cards have abilities that adds extra combat power to the deck.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Mobage","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":23258,"FileName":"42d77a66-45c3-4033-b1e0-021300668e1b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23258,"FileName":"53ade76c-9847-48ea-a428-30c22ca6e3e4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23258,"FileName":"5f379a4e-2d15-4e89-ac82-4529a0f0684d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31725,"Name":"Mass Effect: Infiltrator","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mass Effect Infiltrator is a three dimensional third person shooter which mimics many of the gameplay features and animations of the main Mass Effect games, including the use of cover and the combination of gunplay and biotic powers.

Ports created later in the year for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and the Game Boy Advance were published by Rockstar Games. A Mac OS port was published on July 16, 2002 by MacSoft in North America and Feral Interactive in the rest of the world.[2] There were plans for a Dreamcast version of Max Payne, but they were canceled due to the discontinuation of the console.[5] The game was re-released on April 27, 2009 as a downloadable game in the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360.[6] The game was also re-released in the spring of 2012 as a downloadable game in the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 under the PS2 classics banner, iOS and on Android.\n\nThe game centers on the NYPD Detective Max Payne, who attempts to avenge the murder of his family. It features a gritty neo-noir style and uses graphic novel panels (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game, as it draws inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many allusions to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök, and several of the names used in the game are those of the Norse gods and mythos. The gameplay is heavily influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo,[7][8][9] and it was one of the first games to feature the bullet time effect popularized by The Matrix.\n\nMax Payne received very positive reviews and was praised for its exciting gunplay and use of noir storytelling devices. The game won a large number of accolades,[10] including the BAFTA Award.[11] As of 2011, the Max Payne game franchise has sold over 7.5 million copies.[12] It also inspired a feature film under the same title.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpRoLHvSuE","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31720,"FileName":"e71e8fbe-0b7e-45bb-8544-4e4defbb122f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31720,"FileName":"c5a01b91-dc12-4692-8a42-bcec6bc309dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31720,"FileName":"770e5d87-c09a-496d-be51-013ba51a9091.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127851,"Name":"Metal Slug","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The pinacle of 2D action-shooting is coming back on Android!\nMake your way through multiple battelfields and put an end to the\nRebel Army Leader General Morden's evil plans!!\n\nFeatures list:\n★Not only a perfect port of the original NEOGEO game!\nIn addition to its classic “ARCADE MODE”, this perfect conversion of “METAL SLUG” includes a “MISSION MODE”, allowing you to select in which stage you want to play!\nYou can now train yourself in your favorite stages or those which give you a hard time!\n\n★ Receive items from rescued POWs!\nYou can received several items by rescuing fellow POWs during missions!\nThese items provide upgrades for your powerful weapons!

The game allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple game modes that change gameplay are available, including—but not limited to—a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources to build with. The Java Edition of the game allows players to modify the game with mods to create new gameplay mechanics, items, textures and assets. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition completed two months later.\n\nMinecraft received critical acclaim and won numerous awards, and has since been described as one of the most influential video games in history. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the MineCon convention played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. By mid-2018, the game had around 91 million active players monthly. It is also the best-selling video game of all time, selling over 176 million copies across all platforms by May 2019. A number of spin-off games have also been developed by Mojang such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft Dungeons.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/gcf9FM4TbN4","Platform":"Android","ESRB":"EC - Early Childhood","Genres":" Adventure; Sandbox","Developer":"Mojang","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2011-08-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"28edeff4-8389-4e35-976c-1bfcb3d6572c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"f67351be-aa7a-45f4-8759-5e17aa5a5f2f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"e11db34e-ac76-445b-b437-773e3b73844f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"f5b8292a-4a3c-437d-803b-68a7f3cfc8ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"0ed249b4-cd24-4f86-bf9e-27a615865275.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"020f4e95-6d8a-495f-b64d-6c9b1c2276e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15257,"FileName":"bed271e6-ecbb-4d57-ab6f-c1254a8af0ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":15257,"AlternateName":"Minecraft: Bedrock Edition","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":15257,"AlternateName":"Minecraft: Pocket Edition","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":15257,"AlternateName":"Minecraft: Pocket Edition","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":165516,"Name":"Mines of Mars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Some suspected that Mars once harbored life. \nThere was a reason that it wasn't ever found. \n\nMines of Mars is a procedural atmospheric RPG mining game.\nIt is also a story based adventure game with dark secrets, great weapons, tons of different items, and a gorgeous world to explore. \nThe world of MoM is procedurally created, so that every time you play it, it will be a little different. \nThere are tons of different enemies, dark corridors, and a large variety of fauna and ambient creatures. \n\n-Huge Procedurally generated underground world \n-Customizable RPG system\n-Night and Day system \n-Dark secrets \n-Atmospheric vibes \n-3 Mini Games \n-Original Ambient Soundtrack by Evan Gipson \n-Lots of flora and fauna \n-Tons of Weapons and Items \n-Great storyline \n-Gravity Mining! \n-Huge Bosses","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Crescent Moon Games","Publisher":"Crescent Moon Games","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165516,"FileName":"48f36b89-ebf5-4b84-9b86-7e39a32d56cc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31589,"Name":"Mini Motor Racing WRT","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mini Motor Racing WRT is a top-down arcade racing game and the sequel to Mini Motor Racing. It was initially released in South Korea in 2014 as Mini Motor WRT and published by Selvas with a license to include cars from the South Korean car manufacturer Kia Motors. The game was later, or for iOS possibly simultaneously, released worldwide as Mini Motor Racing WRT. While the gameplay is in many ways similar, the sequel is released as a free-to-play game with in-app purchases instead of a commercial release for the original game.\n\nNext to a quick race with asymmetrical PvP multiplayer, there are four main game modes: career, league, challenges and race club. It is also possible to practice or to race another player through a Bluetooth connection. Shown from an almost top-down view, the player controls a car on various small tracks with arcade gameplay. Optionally a third-person view, always from behind, can be chosen as well. Steering is done on the left side by moving a thumb over a steering wheel to change the direction of a red arrow, while the right side of the screen holds two on-screen buttons for braking and nitro. By winning races coins are earned as the basic currency along with experience to level up. Tracks are based on four types of surfaces that favour a certain type of car. Cars are split up in three categories: WRT, the Japanese Choro-Q cars (known in the West as Penny Racers), and the licensed Kia cars (Cadenza, Mohave, Optima, Picanto, Rio, Sorento, Soul etc.). Cars can be leveled up multiple times and have different statistics based on speed, nitro, corner (turning) and acceleration. Next to coins, many other types of currencies are used, such as the premium trophies, coupons, green clovers and lucky diamonds. The game also uses an energy/stamina system where each race consumes an amount of gas that regenerates slowly. Additional boosters such as nitro can be bought and equipped before races.\n\nCars are mainly bought through coins or trophies, but they can also be built and require extensive upgrading through different types of parts that are earned or bought. Cars can also be sold to salvage parts. There are rare and expensive star parts that take a car to a new level and extensively upgrade the abilities. Cars can also evolve to a next star rating through evolution items. Parts can be combined to create better ones. Lucky green clovers (won in leagues) and lucky diamonds (by buying cars with trophies) increase the chance of earning rare star parts.\n\nNext to the main career mode there are challenge races with an entry fee (coupons) and many rewards. These challenges are played against other racers worldwide in an asymmetrical fashion. Leagues are multiple races in played in succession against other players worldwide asymmetrically, with a limited amount of time for all players to complete the races. Players can team up in race clubs to challenge others, earn rewards and unlock cars only available through that mode. In leagues team members can be recruited with different levels in exchange for coins, with a crew of drivers with different statistics based on max speed and acceleration (initial, middle and final). Next to in-app purchases for the currencies and a gas refill, there are starter packs. Loyal players receive daily rewards.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1OMml_HdL8","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31589,"FileName":"a872eb4c-e94c-43ed-869a-822fd7f14b23.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151718,"Name":"Minimal Sudoku","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It will be the most beautiful, learn-able, and user-friendly Sudoku game you’ve ever played, and it’s free!

Mortal Kombat X was officially announced in June 2014.\n\nLike previous Mortal Kombat games, Mortal Kombat X‍ '​s gameplay consists of two players, or one player and the CPU, fighting against each other with their selected character, using a large, varied array of character specific attacks. The game contains several modes, such as a story mode, which takes place twenty years after the previous Mortal Kombat game, several 'Tower' modes, which feature dynamically changing challenges, numerous online modes, and the 'Krypt', a mode played in a first-person perspective where players explore the areas unlocking a variety of in-game items.\n\nThe console versions of Mortal Kombat X received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release. Most praise was directed at the game's controls, overall gameplay, graphics, story, and characters, with some reviewers calling it the best game in the Mortal Kombat series. However, the PC version of the game was met with a negative reception, with reviewers blaming numerous technical issues for severely hindering the experience.

The Law Enforcer's job is a reverse side of the coin - fight the racers and bust them by different means.\n\nLike in old Need for Speed games, the accent is made on the most powerful cars of the world, with Subaru WRX STi, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X at the very bottom and Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport with Koenigsegg CCXR Edition at the top, total of 64.\n\nThe game also has an online multiplayer mode (with some extra online game modes made available by the Armed and Dangerous Pack DLC). The new Autolog system is introduced with this mode, with the system tracking the player's friends' records and encourages the player to compete with their times.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"IronMonkey Studios","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":121961,"FileName":"eb8746c7-b38d-4498-9f0b-026caccc0c33.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":121961,"FileName":"8716b947-453c-4d9a-ba2f-0b138bb35f14.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17001,"Name":"Need for Speed: Most Wanted","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Buckle up, hit the gas and hold on tight; you’re in for the ride of your life.

The gameplay is split into three types. The first is the current protagonist exploring different areas of the Cage with their companion. During this exploration, they come across Scarecrows which grant and upgrade weapons used to fight enemies within unlocked memories.\n\nIn these memories, dubbed Weapon Stories, players experience the memories of those related to a weapon from a side-scrolling painting-like perspective, entering battles to correct errors in the memories. Battles play out in real-time inside the memories with a party of three characters against enemies, with special attacks utilized by tapping icons on-screen when they have charged. Battles can be performed manually or completed through an auto-battle function. While the storyline characters are present in-game from the outset, other character variations and weapons are obtained through a gacha mechanic. Storyline quests, when completed, unlock optional harder versions of their battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7WPrDc7i4w","Platform":"Android","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Applibot","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"af4f7f78-6ed3-445e-9504-b1e8970d61de.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"015d636f-ad49-4f40-832a-a005e152fdc2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"a56201bb-8d1d-4227-a8fe-11566e16b9fe.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"5fabf1c7-0acb-4e58-a9ab-f73b36311289.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"a5bbe013-7c6e-41b7-b192-ed332c48dc64.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"b172f426-209e-4ac5-a1cc-45eb9a1db008.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"c66789d5-85a3-4390-be82-fa97581b9088.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"fb25be79-7769-48f1-a508-224d62610ab1.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"69fdb241-e18b-455d-a8cd-a37830cde2eb.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"e07c4596-7012-423e-ad4d-55c46f55fc7c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"88f50fd3-adce-40dd-9fe1-b3ca71bd251f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"3b24dd43-a1c9-42bb-94c5-69209dc65d5e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"aaaf0bd8-1b91-405a-bcbb-8ef10c44b3d9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203607,"FileName":"6382c11a-c7fb-42e3-9019-3ff5ae10a36c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":203607,"AlternateName":"NieR Re[in]carnation","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":166436,"Name":"Nimian Legends: BrightRidge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"EXPLORE A BEAUTIFUL, HAND-CRAFTED OPEN WORLD RPG FANTASY WILDERNESS \nRun, swim and fly through glistening waterfalls and rivers, overgrown forests, sky-high mountains and ancient dungeons.

The game was released in a bundle package called The Orange Box for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on October 9, 2007, and for the PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007.[6][7][8] The Windows version of the game is available for download separately through Valve's content delivery system Steam and was released as a standalone retail product on April 9, 2008.[2][3] A standalone version called Portal: Still Alive was released on the Xbox Live Arcade service on October 22, 2008; this version includes an additional 14 puzzles. An OS X version was released as part of the Mac-compatible Steam platform on May 12, 2010.[9] A Linux version was released on Steam as a beta on May 2, 2013,[10] and came out of beta on June 24, 2013.[11] An Android port for the Nvidia Shield was released on May 12, 2014.\n\nThe game primarily comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows momentum to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal.\n\nPortal was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite being considered short in length. The game received praise for its unique gameplay and darkly humorous story. It received acclaim for the character of GLaDOS, voiced by Ellen McLain in the English-language version, and the end credits song \"Still Alive\" written by Jonathan Coulton for the game. Not counting sales through Steam, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release. The game's popularity has led to official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun. A sequel, Portal 2, was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.[12]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH-Bh2SdSOE","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"NVIDIA SHIELD Partners","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31367,"FileName":"817ed358-7d90-460f-bc28-bae10b41e7c3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31367,"FileName":"6e46fd9c-4b16-4bf1-b35d-0e310d2b178c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165522,"Name":"Postknight","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Postknight reimagines the best parts of role-playing games into bite-sized bits within an exciting delivery adventure.\n\nThe story follows the adventures of a Postknight — a knight who is tasked with difficult or dangerous deliveries — in the grand kingdom of Kurestal.

It is an Action role-playing game.[2] In January 2014 the game was Greenlit for Steam.[3]\n\n\nGameplay[edit]\nThe player controls a black swordsman and travels across the map from mission point to mission point. Upon arriving, dialog is displayed and the player can choose their own responses. The player can either accept or reject a quest, or on completion of a quest can demand more gold at the risk of losing any future quests from that location. When the quest is accepted a way point is highlighted and the player can choose to go there immediately or undertake a side quest. Once either the way point, or the side quest, is reached the player enters a 2D battle arena mode which is played as a fighting platform game. Enemies in battle include both ground units and flying ones and upon being attacked grant the player 'rage skulls' for special attacks. Once killed they usually drop gold which can be used to buy better weapons and armor. Each battle fought, whether won or lost, grants experience (one exception being some boss battles) which the player uses to level up. Upon leveling, the player can choose 1 of 3 destiny cards which upgrade their character. Cards do everything from granting more health or strength to allowing the player to heal when they collect gold. Cards can also be bought for 20,000 gold at the fortune teller. Random encounters are common as the player heads from one way point to the next which again makes the player enter the battle arena. The controls are very basic, the player automatically attacks when he is near an enemy while the basic swipe commands execute special attacks which can be increased in strength using 'rage skulls'.

The game is known for its developers' battle against a cloned version of their game released by another company. The game was developed and published by Vlambeer—Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman—and released for iOS on March 14, 2013, and later that year for Android.\n\nPlayers cast a fishing line into the ocean and use motion controls to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish out of the sky for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.\n\nRidiculous Fishing received \"near-universal perfect scores\" at launch[1]—what review score aggregator Metacritic describes as \"universal acclaim\".[2] It won an Apple's 2013 Design Award and was their iPhone game of the year. Reviewers noted Vlambeer's struggle against the copy of their game and praised the game's balance and both visual and game design.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30056,"FileName":"f2ba1a96-bc14-4660-87bf-9d603ab62fd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30056,"FileName":"2a75eadb-6e86-4cef-a8e6-d7e2a7210317.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23435,"Name":"RIFT Mobile","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Trion Worlds Inc.","Publisher":"Trion Worlds Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":23435,"FileName":"72ac2e36-ac1a-41d3-bc35-2faa89f5f34a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164510,"Name":"Riptide GP","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Riptide GP® is the first ever console-quality water racing game for mobile, featuring super-realistic water physics, real-time reflections (dual core or higher), and gorgeous high-detail vehicles and environments.\n\nRev up your supercharged hydro jet and take a wild ride through twisting canals and rivers, futuristic cityscapes, and mysterious research facilities.

It is the sequel to the 1991 game Seiken Densetsu, released in North America as Final Fantasy Adventure and in Europe as Mystic Quest, and it was the first Seiken Densetsu title to be marketed as part of the Mana series rather than the Final Fantasy series. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying warship.\n\nRather than using a turn-based battle system like contemporaneous role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.\n\nThe game received considerable acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, Ring Command menu system, and innovative real-time battle system. Critics also praised the soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta and the customizable artificial intelligence (AI) settings for computer-controlled allies. The original version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008, an additional release for mobile phones in Japan was produced in 2009, and an enhanced port of the game was released for iOS in 2010 and Android in 2014.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31671,"FileName":"43e50c6f-c393-40dc-abdd-d366d08a66b1.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":31671,"FileName":"5082304f-9185-4a0c-afd6-0a248b2ddead.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":31671,"FileName":"556451e2-a9e5-49dd-9c91-f16ca105c8ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31671,"FileName":"59b923c0-2d0a-47c5-802f-14711567381a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27312,"Name":"Sensitive Data: THE Math Game","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Welcome to the Agency,\n\nYou have been chosen to be a part of one of our most important investigation.

It was developed by Sonic Team as its first Sonic game exclusive to smartphones and published by Sega. In Sonic Runners, the player-character constantly ran forward, and players controlled their jumping using the touchscreen. The game featured a wide variety of playable characters from the Sonic series, and was free-to-play and received periodic updates. \nDevelopment began in late 2013 and lasted a year and a half. Sonic Team sought to take advantage of the uses of smartphones and built the game using the Unity game engine. They designed Sonic Runners to have more replay value than other endless running games. The game was soft launched in select regions on February 25, 2015, and officially released worldwide on June 25. It failed commercially and received mixed reviews; although critics praised its gameplay, they criticized the number of pop-up ads and pay-to-play elements, as well as technical problems.

It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series and acts as a sequel to Sonic & Knuckles (1994). Episode I follows Sonic as he sets out to stop Doctor Eggman, who has returned following his defeat in Sonic & Knuckles. The game returns to the Sega Genesis style of Sonic gameplay, with movement restricted to a 2D plane. Like previous Sonic games, the player races through levels, collecting rings while rolling into a ball to attack enemies. The game also features special stages in which the player collects Chaos Emeralds and online leaderboards comparing level completion times and high scores. Development began in June 2009 and lasted a year and a half. The game was conceived as a smartphone-exclusive spin-off before becoming a multiplatform, mainline Sonic installment. It was designed to appeal to both older Sonic fans who played the Genesis games and newer ones who played later games like Sonic Unleashed (2008). As a continuation of the classic Sonic titles, Episode I features no voice acting, a simple control scheme, level design emphasizing platforming and momentum-based gameplay, and no player characters besides Sonic himself; however, it incorporates Sonic's design and homing attack ability from Sonic Adventure (1998). Producer Takashi Iizuka and composer Jun Senoue were the only Sonic 4 developers who contributed to the Genesis games. \nEpisode I was released worldwide in October 2010 as a downloadable game for iOS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. A release for Windows Phone followed in June 2011, for Windows and Android in January 2012, for BlackBerry Tablet OS in July 2012, and for Ouya in July 2013. The game received moderately positive reviews and sold over a million copies in under a year. Critics described Episode I as a satisfying return to classic Sonic gameplay and praised the sense of nostalgia. Criticism was directed at its physics engine, considered inferior to that of the Genesis games, and its short length. Episode I was envisioned as the first of an episodic video game trilogy. Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II was released in May 2012, while Episode III was never made.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2012-01-25T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"140369da-1729-4c80-9f16-917b788777d0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"807683f9-13a3-4701-9634-faca1b95cc60.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"cf6cabd1-d49c-468d-968c-b5c2a6219e5c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"a61a8e07-e786-4527-831c-c0ae81c533d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"04a5f822-6c23-4705-ad06-4a18271aaad7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"6d888c8e-1995-4241-a59c-7f61b5733dd5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"36b5ca6b-7123-4fcb-a792-bd55cdffdc42.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"bcd8be8d-79bb-4f56-888b-0980c708a01a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"cffd0739-ee08-4271-b388-1253ca48c360.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"02a9c867-6ced-4881-af6b-9efa9ef3bd09.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180027,"FileName":"67a9e608-4ad9-4d6f-8b46-0acc996197d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":172959,"Name":"Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Sonic 4 Saga continues in Episode II with the return of a beloved side kick and fan-favorite villains!

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and led directly to the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again.\nMagic Age 1053—\nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun—the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back.\nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire.\nPetun—little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come.\nThis is where our story begins—the story of the Seven Year War.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAJibwdmSWQ","Platform":"Android","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Construction and Management Simulation; Fighting; Flight Simulator; Puzzle; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Idea Factory","Publisher":"Iceberg Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":23912,"FileName":"1fd59c6e-d572-41fc-bc9d-f435d05ca5dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23912,"FileName":"f871b31f-62a0-400b-9872-ec17981da3b1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23912,"FileName":"329b3200-d58c-4a5f-a468-7d78842ea90d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23667,"Name":"Spirit Stones","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"GAMEVIL Inc","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":23667,"FileName":"0428e750-9023-410d-b134-ca223a341c55.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202275,"Name":"SpongeBob: Krusty Cook Off","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Let’s get cookin’!\n\nJoin SpongeBob SquarePants on a hilarious culinary adventure through the restaurants and kitchens of Bikini Bottom!

The game was released in Japan in December 2016, and worldwide from July 2018. In November 2019, the game was shutdown in all regions outside Japan.\n\nSet in Space Date 539 (A.D 2625), the player controls the captain of the Pangalactic Federation starship GFSS-3214F, which was exploring deep space following the events of Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness two years earlier. After a surprise attack by pirates, the entire crew jettison the vessel in escape pods while the captain stays on board with only the AI robot Coro (voiced by Ryūsei Nakao). Making the decision to activate the ship's hyperspace drive, the warp fails and ends up sending them to a distant region of space outside the Federation's borders. While investigating a seemingly barren planet, they happen upon a mysterious woman being chased by a monster. The woman, named Evelysse (voiced by Sumire Uesaka), uses a powerful form of Symbology magic that allows her to summon warriors from throughout time, and manages to escape with the aid of her time-warped allies. After she joins the captain back on the ship, the course is set to return home to the incredibly distant Earth.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/kb7CvNitHAw","Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"tri-Ace Inc.","Publisher":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181119,"FileName":"02d44278-9230-4db0-8805-2d48ba3033c4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181119,"FileName":"37bf0842-98dd-46c3-9a10-02093af724da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":181119,"FileName":"5bed63bc-185d-4399-b5e3-a512ffc201e4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181119,"FileName":"e6a71f09-964e-43d0-b026-fbf16f54013c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23672,"Name":"Star Realms","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"White Wizard Games","Publisher":"White Wizard Games","ReleaseDate":"2014-07-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23672,"FileName":"e9365e6c-70ed-47cd-83dd-7324c9b8b5e4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":172960,"Name":"Star Trek Trexels II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Take command of your favorite ships as you search the galaxy for iconic Starfleet officers.

It offers a variety of buildings (houses, shops, public buildings from the series) that the player buys with an in-game currency of \"dollars\", while buying premium items with real-world cash via donuts, a reference to Homer Simpson's passion for donuts within the series. Many buildings come with a questline for the player to follow and some add with them a character from the series; players collect characters along with buildings. Characters can be sent on tasks to progress with the quests to advance with the game, and to earn extra money to save up for items. Each building regularly generates a sum of in-game cash to collect, under names such as \"Income tax\" from houses and the \"Collection plate\" from the First Church of Springfield. Players can also place rivers, roads, pavement and decorations on the land. In 2013, developers added the \"Krustyland\" transporter, to get players from Springfield to the infamous Krustyland, where they can expand and build similar to player interactions in the game's Springfield.\n\nThe game is supported by EA's Origin, which acts as a social bridge to where players log in to their Origin accounts and visit friends' towns to collect cash once every 24 hours; and occasionally other tasks during an event.\n\nThere is a hidden easter egg where, in order to obtain the statue of Jebediah Springfield decoration, the player must tap Homer 10 times in a row whilst he is performing any task. This action also gives the player 10 free donuts, but can only work once.\n\nThe maximum number of levels is currently 59 since the November 10, 2015 update.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGr0UIX8T_k","Platform":"Android","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Fox Digital Entertainment, Inc.","Publisher":"EA Mobile","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30206,"FileName":"4881a205-0744-4503-a171-0e639b44230a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30206,"FileName":"060e1f28-c9f5-4fb5-b2c9-13b77b931a05.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20591,"Name":"The Sims 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"LONG LIVE THE SIMS!

To achieve their quest, the player will have to use their strategic sense to win the many fights and progress in the mastery of this ancestral martial art.\nThe rules of the game rock, paper, scissors are known worldwide. The set of features and the number of special moves (called Jin’rais) that the player will have to discover will demand perseverance in order to master all of the subtleties.

The game is characterised by a comic and whacky orientation situated in a world marked by Asian culture and manga.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n*Accessible and profound “Easy to learn, Hard to master”\n*Regular events (tournaments, collaborative combats)\n*Craft system\n*Player against player fights ( to come : PVE Environment and RAIDS/ATTACKS : revenge between players )\n*Turn-based system\n\n\nStory\nThe game takes place in a crazy world inspired by medieval Japan and populated by anthropomorphic animals of all kinds. The player starts the story by reaching the only “Jan Ken Pon” dojo in the region, in the hope of being chosen by the Master of the dojo and so becoming an “apprentice”. At that point, the apprentices will be assigned a spirit guardian who will allow them to transcend the combat techniques of “Jan Ken Pon”. They will discover that it is then possible to achieve a perfect partnership with their spirit guardians in order to perform special moves called \"Jin’rais\". Unfortunately, just after their arrival, an apprentice will go to a cursed place in the dojo and release all the evil energy which was confined.\nThe balance of the world will then be broken.

It began as a small project with the goal to improve the original game here or there, but has since gradually grown into something much, much bigger. The games are quite different from each other, so there is no need to play the original game before trying this one (but I would recommend to try it as well, it's good).\n\nThe main feature of YetAnotherPD which makes it different from original game and other mods is that it is mostly focused on tweaking game mechanics in order to make the game more interesting, diverse and balanced. Anyone who is familiar with the original game will have much to learn again in YAPD.\n\nThe features of this mod at this point:\n\n- Four character classes were reworked and now have different strengths and weaknesses\n\n- Four difficulty variants, to provide adequate challenge for every type of a player\n\n- A variety of equipment options - dual wielding, firearms, shields, and more!\n\n- Most enchantments on the weapons and armor now are more powerful than before\n\n- Environment now affects stealth and evasion, encouraging a more tactical approach\n\n- All bosses have been completely or partially reworked and are now even more epic!\n\n- New items, enemies, traps, and interactions added between them!\n\n- Loading tips and more detailed information about items and character stats\n\n- Improved user interface - auto-aiming, extended journal and other stuff\n\n- Both new and modified potions, scrolls, wands, rings and other items...\n\n- Healing, stealth, wand usage and item durability systems were reworked!\n\n- Many old enemies gained new abilities or were moved to other parts of the dungeon\n\n- Each chapter now contains six floors (a total of 31 floor dungeon instead of 26)\n\n- Shops are now on every fifth level, and their assortment has become more varied\n\n- Even more features are coming later since this project is still in development!","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Android","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ConsideredHamster","Publisher":"ConsideredHamster","ReleaseDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165536,"FileName":"d7bd4295-de06-4913-a0e4-3eb4a5d4b0ff.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32797,"Name":"Zenonia 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zenonia 2: The Lost Memories is the sequel to Zenonia, an action role-playing game developed, created, and published by Gamevil for the iOS and Android.
