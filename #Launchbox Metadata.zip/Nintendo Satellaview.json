Two versions were released - a non-SoundLink game and a SoundLink game. The original non-SoundLink version was released as BSF-Zero 2 Practice on June 1, 1997 (although the title screen remained the same). It contained the four courses first seen throughout BS F-Zero Grand Prix (a Satellaview remake of the original), along with a new course called Mute City IV. Little is known about the later SoundLink version outside of surviving videos, but it was distributed in two halves in August 1997 and had a similar announcer and redone soundtrack as the previous Satellaview entry. At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called \"Forest I\" and \"Forest II\". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26379":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"ea5fec29-205b-43f0-bb5c-917243f9f6b9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"12b72393-c2a6-4299-9a15-531185e96409.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"02278e8f-43db-497b-9803-0e35f52c75b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bb726856-8767-44eb-b0c9-67bcf8b95cb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"BS Chrono Trigger Jet Bike Special","Overview":"Chrono Trigger is a game for the Super Famicom.

The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.\nThe Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.\n\nInterestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee Shot.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DZiNSz5SxdE"},"123735":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Dr. Mario","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"BS Dr. Mario"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"238da50f-60e5-4ac8-855c-4138e2a3909f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5b90a8ef-3b6b-4689-9697-ee5a487f0e89.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d0bd73a8-9236-4b86-b1e2-25263179d67b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"7bcfd5df-8421-43e3-81c0-1136ae2d2de4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9b58d106-e047-4915-a481-b609d0f4af6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"723ce791-0faf-419d-8c98-e200ae926528.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ade8424b-aaba-431c-ac71-3db6e6e37046.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dr. Mario BS Ban","Overview":"Dr. Mario BS Version is a Satellaview video game released in 1997 for the Super Famicom.

The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.\n\nThe game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health.

The game is a text-based point-and-click-style adventure game where still images are presented to the player and the player may guide a hand-shaped icon around the screen to select objects in the image to investigate further. A number of icons in a side-bar present the player with options such as taking notes, speaking, or placing telephone calls. Similar gameplay was used in other games from the FDS era including the popular Shadowgate.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lYvfBXjLoK8"},"172395":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c56abd3d-235f-415c-af91-52ccde1ad60d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a0215627-9a8e-4188-b13b-54286629d60b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"36b60659-0f39-4e34-bd1e-a22c695807fc.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9dc4136b-b12d-4c03-8e97-342c33b82c1f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a94e9f56-2a6c-498c-9431-b13eeb67a989.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"14a5aa57-4023-4810-93b7-41ee241b4aaf.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b80055da-c99a-4b6a-b396-ca93d5a1a4bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e5cd0b2b-0d14-41b7-a4e0-985047bcd715.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Legend of Zelda: Third Quest","Overview":"The Legend of Zelda: Third Quest was an expanded version of The Legend of Zelda that was released for the Satellaview add-on of the Snes\/Sfc System in Japan.

BS Shin Onigashima takes its plot from the original version of the game, but is mostly presented from the viewpoint of the three helpers who join the protagonists during the game (the dog, monkey and pheasant).

Although multi-part ROM merges like this have been performed by fans and hackers in the past (notably true for BS Zelda no Densetsu), the degree of difficulty involved in such a task often requires the work of multiple people and there is no evidence that such a collaborative effort was ever made. Furthermore, the resulting ROM produced by such an effort would most likely be geared toward emulator compatibility whereas this ROM is not. Finally, the fact that the ROM's BS-X checksum is valid would be highly improbable for a ROM hack.\n\nInvestigations into the origin of the ROM file have led to claims by the creator of the BS-X Cult, Pachuka, that the ROM was originally stolen in the 1990s from a person known only as ROMar. Current fan speculation favors the notion that the ROM is actually a prototype associated with the February-May 1996 Satellaview broadcasts.\n\nThe major difference between the prototype version and the broadcast version is that the prototype version contains all four episodes in one ROM. The player selects from the start menu which episode he wishes to begin, which items he wishes to begin with, and what the values will be for certain character stats.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased"},"191404":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Enix","Genres":"Role-Playing","Name":"BS Fuurai no Shiren: Surara wo Sukue: Dai-1-Shuu","Overview":"BS Furai no Shiren: Surara wo Sukue is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 3 runs between April 28, 1996 and August 2, 1997.\n\nThe gameplay of BS Furai no Shiren: Surara wo Sukue is substantially similar to the earlier roguelike, Fushigi no Dungeon 2: Furai no Shiren, a game released for the SFC on December 1, 1995 and subsequently localized for English markets in March 2008 as Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer for the Nintendo DS.

The ending involves speaking to Mr. Miyazawa himself and returning to the real world via the Galaxy Express train.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ihatovo_Monogatari"}}
