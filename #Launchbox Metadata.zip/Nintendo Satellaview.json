Although multi-part ROM merges like this have been performed by fans and hackers in the past (notably true for BS Zelda no Densetsu), the degree of difficulty involved in such a task often requires the work of multiple people and there is no evidence that such a collaborative effort was ever made. Furthermore, the resulting ROM produced by such an effort would most likely be geared toward emulator compatibility whereas this ROM is not. Finally, the fact that the ROM's BS-X checksum is valid would be highly improbable for a ROM hack.\n\nInvestigations into the origin of the ROM file have led to claims by the creator of the BS-X Cult, Pachuka, that the ROM was originally stolen in the 1990s from a person known only as ROMar. Current fan speculation favors the notion that the ROM is actually a prototype associated with the February-May 1996 Satellaview broadcasts.\n\nThe major difference between the prototype version and the broadcast version is that the prototype version contains all four episodes in one ROM. The player selects from the start menu which episode he wishes to begin, which items he wishes to begin with, and what the values will be for certain character stats.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Enix","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":191373,"FileName":"86ebf3b8-9d46-47de-b4ef-5d8a49f6cf35.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":191368,"Name":"BS Dragon Quest I: Dai-1-Wa","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"BS Dragon Quest is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast between February 1, 1996 and May 25, 1996.

New tweaks by the developers were to include platform-style action scenes, and to set time limits for choosing certain commands.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190686,"Name":"BS SimCity Machizukuri Taikai: Scenario 1","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In August 1996, a special version of SimCity for SNES was broadcast exclusively to Japan through the Super Famicom Satellaview system titled BSシムシティまちづくり大会 (BS SimCity Machizukuri Taikai, lit. \"BS SimCity Town Planning Competition\").

The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.\nThe Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.\n\nInterestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee Shot.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZiNSz5SxdE","Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":97161,"FileName":"1d52da6b-5669-43fd-b4c6-b238ee5bea19.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97161,"FileName":"14316754-8107-41c7-894a-6abffba6a723.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97161,"FileName":"89a1f856-137e-4dd9-b552-d8a27b43e9d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":97161,"FileName":"f6fb8349-c834-4ac9-851d-de62793f0aca.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":97161,"FileName":"fac53f3b-c450-44dc-aa60-d09593d38281.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190670,"Name":"BS Super Mario Collection: Dai-1-shuu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"BS Super Mario Collection is a remake of Super Mario Collection for the Satellaview.

You wouldn’t really consider a prize-winning game to get C-grade reviews and all. It was criticized for being a Super Dante game and also probably for being a comedy. To be clear, this for a JRPG starring a chicken! \n \nCock-A-Doodle-Do is about the misadventures of an alcoholic boy named Nicole (unfortunately for him), who recently lost all his fortune, and his last possession, a pet chicken named Pal. Pal fights animal poachers, befriends a cat and a fairy, and perhaps later on in the game does actual JRPG-like heroic deeds.

Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to eliminate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath.\n\nThe other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of \"Lightning Panels\", which are generated when panels are destroyed other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and the player will see more of them. If the player then destroys a life panel, all lightning panels of the same color will explode as well. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction.

The bat is a trampoline held by two Rick-like hamsters. The game uses a star-counter, which decreases periodically on its own. Hitting any one block will dislodge several stars which fall down from where the block was - catching one will increment the player's star counter by 5. If Kirby (the ball) hits the ground when the star counter is higher than zero, he will bounce once, so the player gets one more chance to catch him. Otherwise, the player loses a life. Every time Kirby touches the ground, the star counter is reduced by 10.\n\nOnce the player clears the first five stages, King Dedede appears in stage 6. This stage has no blocks, so the player's star counter cannot increase. Dedede throws hammers from time to time - if Rick is hit, the player will not be able to control him for a short while.

The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.\n\nThe game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126805,"FileName":"282ee709-02c3-4acc-8349-5f8276d636f7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126805,"FileName":"c744c51a-450b-43e0-83e2-f5fb393224d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126805,"FileName":"444888ed-b206-40bb-abdb-c64dac4d5ced.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126806,"Name":"Nintama Rantarou 2","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"Nintama Rantaro 2 is a Downloadable game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 runs between March 29, 1998 and November 28, 1998.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Culture Brain","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126806,"FileName":"97ea40c9-349a-43c3-8c14-8f77a86cdab3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126806,"FileName":"e2156701-0d23-4eec-93d6-38ebe7f180e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126806,"FileName":"acfbe47b-48b0-4196-8cae-dd21bbfee1ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126807,"Name":"Panel de Pon: Event '98","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"Panel de Pon Event '98 is a Downloadable game for the Satellaview that was broadcast on January 31, 1998, it is a slightly modified event version of the game Panel de Pon.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Intelligent Systems","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126807,"FileName":"2aa291cd-b8c1-4196-8f71-4996c1cbed0d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126807,"FileName":"aa4929f3-c483-4edb-a182-77a893f64b06.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126807,"FileName":"24d6ed42-00f9-4e88-b462-00fa39ed7e68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126807,"FileName":"37d28ff8-f4d5-4282-b719-403d496e3375.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126783,"Name":"RPG Tsukuru 2","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"RPG Tsukuru 2 is a Satellaview-compatible Slotted Cartridge game belonging to ASCII's Tsukuru series.

Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a \"Third Quest\", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLjuG2g3aAU","Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"a0215627-9a8e-4188-b13b-54286629d60b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"36b60659-0f39-4e34-bd1e-a22c695807fc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"c56abd3d-235f-415c-af91-52ccde1ad60d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"9dc4136b-b12d-4c03-8e97-342c33b82c1f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"14a5aa57-4023-4810-93b7-41ee241b4aaf.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"a94e9f56-2a6c-498c-9431-b13eeb67a989.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"b80055da-c99a-4b6a-b396-ca93d5a1a4bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172395,"FileName":"e5cd0b2b-0d14-41b7-a4e0-985047bcd715.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126845,"Name":"Treasure Conflix","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Treasure Conflix is a Downloadable game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in February 1996.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Square","Publisher":"Square","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126845,"FileName":"b5c0defa-934b-47d5-ac7c-8ea09ec20c12.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126845,"FileName":"3a4227ed-fcf8-4822-a74d-a23ef8bf8498.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126845,"FileName":"21585d4f-aad2-4bf7-b52f-d461dee28844.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126845,"FileName":"fa7dfd86-fc5d-49ae-add7-f2080efbeb82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182754,"Name":"Tsuri Tarou","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Tsuri Tarou (\"Fishing Taro\") is a 1994 angling game from Pack-In-Video.

These unnatural energies are especially focused in a series of tunnels beneath the Temple of Sages in Llylgamyn, fittingly called the Maelstrom. Adventurers, namely the player party, are recruited to journey into these caverns and track down a means of summoning a being known as the Gatekeeper who can seal these chaotic energies once more. Unfortunately, he has been imprisoned by a rogue sorceress known as the Sorn.\n\nThe party begins by searching for G'bli Gedook, a high priest and guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb. He instructs the party to venture deeper into the caverns. After traversing down to the eighth floor, the party must appease four beings known as the Card Lords by bringing them their respective suit. Once this task is accomplished, the party can venture to the Heart of the Maelstrom and the Gatekeeper may be summoned. As this occurs, the Sorn and her own party of adventurers strike, prompting a final battle. With her defeat, the Gatekeeper awards the party the Heart of Abriel. They return with this to the surface and order is restored to Llylgamyn.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Satellaview","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ASCII","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182757,"FileName":"d01c2a7e-7765-4106-87c0-d54cbca67806.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182757,"AlternateName":"BS Wizardry V","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182757,"AlternateName":"BS Wizardry 5","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":124584,"Name":"Yoshi no Panepon BS Ban","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Yoshi no Panepon BS Ban is a Downloadable game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 11 runs between November 3, 1996 and June 30, 2000.
