The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/80WA0_EWq7E","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Lemon","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"5656e1bc-94d5-46f0-a979-6e404eef1d78.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"ce10d4ac-9603-4833-a466-d8dca8a8422d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"966d8ddb-1e0e-4a63-9375-d9d07142d6b8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"8dc0f12b-5336-458c-b9c8-b1c3b4bead5b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"3717e885-f675-456e-b428-ccb6927300fe.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"6590dc7d-d174-4317-958c-2e2693aa7a49.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"c85ca755-71c8-4f01-823c-feda6a4715d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"a3996257-e707-4d05-8bdf-a24bb5076d02.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"fb9f830d-e753-4ae4-b99d-8f8806a46d62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"441cf916-f8a5-486f-88a6-d1fdebaa59c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"b4444c9c-c6ea-447e-811a-705039bba162.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"359fb70f-6cd4-4b8e-b434-884b07520eb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"f87369cf-68c0-4dc8-b735-56849110c818.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"1dcf977c-025c-4cd1-a5e1-2b1edd502854.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"FileName":"423dc828-145d-4342-918d-c4856fa0957a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10489,"AlternateName":"A+M+O+K","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10489,"AlternateName":"A•M•O•K","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10489,"AlternateName":"AMOK","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":10491,"Name":"Actua Soccer: Club Edition","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"Actua Soccer Club Edition is a re-edition of Actua Soccer, released with the 20 teams of the English Premiership instead of international competitions.

Players take control of an airline as it's CEO, and must first select the name, tail logo and home airport of their airline. The game is turn-based between each airline. Each airline has four \"board members\" who can be assigned to perform various tasks, which take varying length to accomplish. These tasks include buying aircraft, bidding for slots at an airport, buying facilities at an airport and marketing a PR campaign in a region. Once the player has purchased aircraft, they must further make planning of the route between two airports with available slots. Once a route is setup, the player is able to manage how many planes fly the route daily and the number of passengers they carry, as well as ticket price.\n\nThe game is played over one of two scenarios, each representing a different era. The game is over when any airline reaches the target money amount.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31350,"FileName":"620a76e3-7c07-4aaf-b3b8-ad633f987200.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31350,"FileName":"bcb97e67-239a-42de-9977-43d07587378b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31350,"FileName":"4356fa19-64d9-47db-80b8-7787b735c077.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31350,"FileName":"06fc9ab9-72e6-4ad8-ba4d-fbecd2ea0597.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31350,"FileName":"2a0c7858-a1e6-464d-aec8-8fc6eb991833.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31350,"FileName":"d229d1ed-3c00-4989-8622-2258d632d484.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":31350,"AlternateName":"First Flight SS Air Management 96\\","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":31351,"Name":"Airs Adventure","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Airs Adventure takes place in an environment reminiscent of 17th century Europe.

Simply put, this is an excellent video game and to date it's perhaps the best Doom-clone to bloody the consoles.\n\nFrom the colony of LV-426 to the Alien spaceship (which brought the plague to the infested prison colony), all of the 30-some levels pay tribute to the films. Whimpering people are encrusted in the Alien-ified walls (who explode when you shoot them, or spurt chestbursters to punish the loitering Colonial Marine), towering Alien Queens that attack with relentless abandon, sleeping tanks (inspired by the films), and eggs that lazily slip open when a hurting Marine can least afford it.\n\nAlien Trilogy also delivers the arsenal Colonial Marines will die to get their hands on. Ranging from a Beretta to a steadicam-mounted smart rifle, Acclaim provides enough firepower for the experienced Marine to show every Alien Queen who's boss. The weapons also enjoy their trademark sounds from the films, including the high-pitched jam of the pulse rifle. Like the films, Alien Trilogy employs incredible savvy in how it uses sound. There's just you and the dark, moody music, the pulse-quickening hum of the motion tracker, and two sets of jaws at every turn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfKQMAHwuA","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Probe","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1996-07-31T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"468d6efd-6c30-4c71-bc7f-8b45e1b67487.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"0c08b9a9-4c5e-4cd7-b180-8dbfe5dfdac2.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"1043f3b2-b9cc-415b-970d-6d187de034de.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"d38f32ea-a6be-4f51-a5f5-7825cfbe78af.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"8d8015de-59d6-467b-a3e7-f979c81777d0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"ce444881-4d59-46fd-abdf-11ed65525fad.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"7f6812d3-4722-4473-a528-96eb0841fae1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"7e5aafeb-fc43-4540-8cf0-422b6f66c5cb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"28dd6fdb-504e-41c2-b21e-e262428ff7ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"0f1e278a-a393-43e4-95e0-7230bf05656b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"e60aa160-8d3d-47e6-ab3b-26e6d18b4a34.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"d4f52204-c428-428e-ad96-59b9509f1a91.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"67316985-c010-428a-a6a4-f6e6f07b685d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"e7f2c8b6-9e17-4b0a-be54-e1cf38f82b56.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"00893610-d055-49f1-a2c1-398fcb93c9f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"8c09f1e3-5ea5-468a-9fe9-fde3f96081c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"8a6a7c3c-ab3d-4f48-b748-680e5f8ef25a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"e6d5a284-c7b4-4098-9507-6bf027853250.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"ca690bc1-f41c-4d31-9727-3601fb81bab3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"6f2eb00a-e7a2-488f-b56f-931364cbdc18.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"ee8ded67-b565-43c4-8ce5-415304f9095c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"3211c4c6-85a7-4949-b4d2-87395609cdf1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"a6c6f454-8474-43fb-8333-facb772fff8d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"1748e07a-80ae-4b25-b8b5-1237fa736d74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2421,"FileName":"c9f61fca-f33b-4b94-b0e7-727f50944491.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15190,"Name":"All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The All-Star Baseball baseball video game series was developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment.

While there are some supernatural goings-on (Voodoo black magic), the main villains are gangsters and pirates. While the enemies are revealed to be possessed by evil spirits, and are green and zombie-like in appearance, they are far from the shambling walking corpses of the first game, and walk, talk, and behave much like ordinary people, arming themselves with Tommy Guns and shouting at the player. The game world is larger than that of the original, encompassing not only the mansion, but also the surrounding gardens as well as a pirate ship hidden in caverns beneath the house.\n \nAlthough much of the game is spent playing as Carnby, the player will occasionally take control of Grace Saunders. Grace, a child, cannot fight and is instantly captured if the gangsters spot her, so instead she must sneak around and defeat the gangsters by turning common household objects into booby traps.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/h5SYXX3YZGw","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Infogrames","Publisher":"Interplay Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1996-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"1c95671f-5c2b-41df-b435-3b4314fb450d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"ba9ce66e-7b61-43cc-bebf-247389c3b6b4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"93e4e952-44fe-4c99-8f79-2d33715255ee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"3a4b3659-b7cb-4891-9594-31f3754f3e2b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"6651f9a1-df36-469f-b1da-d64774ed45e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"e4e104f3-66c6-4b8e-b724-b31ba661d790.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"cf4ddcb6-e353-4609-97cb-5c5a2da04b41.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"fd475b3e-b37d-409c-a4b4-c52ce67cd30e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"fc885605-7b9c-4e99-80d2-e464923402e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"a4a4f396-6852-4c9b-8154-4ee717ff4777.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"ea984dcb-6e9c-4844-8461-5e25559089d2.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"a497bcdb-10a2-4784-81ac-d365744afc44.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"db9bd560-ada3-4c7d-9017-f1427eaefb64.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"06a87884-24d4-40ca-a9bc-0ca952fc6304.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"a9de7fb8-4b9c-405b-8e01-f7b876d1f4c9.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"ad1199d7-bf46-4162-a1ea-b5ea0a5b25eb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"69d0d2d9-c55b-431a-8a0d-db0b52a9dc6b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"635fadce-85f2-449e-95c9-6e07439e233d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"ed7482df-f1a6-492e-a821-983e2eba519f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"FileName":"4aeedbc9-98db-427e-9e7f-17a7e52714b3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9613,"AlternateName":"Alone in the Dark: Jack is Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9613,"AlternateName":"Alone in the Dark 2","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":31338,"Name":"Amagi Shien","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Amagi Shien (天城紫苑) is an adventure game developed by Clip House for the Sega Saturn.

The player character is a high-school sophomore student, whose name, nickname, birth date and blood type is decided by the player at the beginning of the game. One day, while walking through the park, you notice a beautiful girl, but don't really manage to make a good impression on her and she soon goes away. The next day, your homeroom teacher announces you have a new student joining your class ... her name is Misuzu Amano ... the girl you met a day ago in the park. Your luck didn't completely run out as now you will have plenty of time to try and make an impression on her and possibly make her fall in love with you. But she is not the only girl in school that caught your eyes, so you will have to decide who is your person of interest and who you will try to woo. Luckily for you, you are not alone on your quest, you will have a help from heaven itself, an angel by the name Eve, who will often give you advice on girls' feelings.\n\nThe basic gameplay is similar to visual novel style with dialogues and occasional selectable answers, but while you're in your room you'll be able to perform some other actions such as study, work part-time to earn some income, ask Eve for advice, set events on your calendar, join the school clubs and similar options. While dialogues use typical anime character style to represent characters, each of the main heroines also has a small figure-like character that represents her. They come in five different degrees of emotions between love and hate, the middle one being neutral, neither loving nor hating you. The game features animations for certain memorable events, while the dialogues mostly use static images with different postures. Voice-acting is included but is not complete, meaning even the heroines that talk during dialogues do not talk throughout all of their dialogues bust only some of them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Visual Novel","Developer":"Astrovision.

As the story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their \"invented magic sticks\" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into their original form and recovering the keys of time.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder \"boss\" creature you must defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.\n\nThe game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics.

The player is tasked, along with fellow STAAR members, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must kill all of the genetically altered soldiers and aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members (at the cost of one life point), however if nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter will be started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels. None of the actual aliens will appear until the office level.\n \nThere are five types of different weaponry available to the player during the course of the game. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets throughout the game. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy in able to kill it. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol. The player will also find grenades in crates and bonus rooms which, when used, destroys most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a max of 9 grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with \"flammable\" warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhogLgugpk4","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Tantalus Interactive","Publisher":"Midway","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"7d5118c1-2f70-4205-921c-ae36e4551a01.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"3bc47ca8-68fc-464b-a824-b45c2be12722.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"1ced6bbf-9aef-46b3-9b2b-ff25c22f0202.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"728419de-b47e-476f-a01a-bf75bd09addd.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"72bf4060-59c4-4ef5-a178-53ddcdb3619e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"1d419cbc-18a9-4024-affe-f98b5ef02dfd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"f90d8edc-efd6-4223-b952-a88451d37ee2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"d02f0f9f-d084-49fb-941e-9205225ccf6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"7fca851b-543b-4dd0-862c-1bd8cd349d3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"9844a50b-e29b-46a5-9730-bb4a3924996a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"9224f4d4-8b3e-4f17-a3e5-5c097aa60421.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"5ba3f440-6294-4041-8ae2-c30991287f8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"17e582e8-687b-4a6f-a3eb-f4e3013a612d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"80da0793-8c8c-4017-a082-864a68dcb9ae.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"00914dcb-9612-4753-9ddd-dc82b386b1e5.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"82631daa-825e-458b-9d5b-31f8534f5efe.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"f21dae8d-1572-4995-9cd7-8c81ba64fdda.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"af0ab35a-9fcd-4409-a16e-4ec2564c8bc7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"f4c734bd-8aba-4bad-a2d6-8241066fc6bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9614,"FileName":"2b220c4b-0d8a-43fd-9b15-e43b1929c0d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31354,"Name":"Arthur to Astaroth no Nazomakaimura: Incredible Toons","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A Japanese-only entry in Dynamix's The Incredible Machine series based on the Ghosts 'N Goblins series.\n\nIt is the only The Incredible Machine game with a plot, which is the same as in every Ghosts 'N Goblins game: the princess is kidnapped by Astaroth (the main villain of the games), so Arthur (the main character in the series) has to save her.

Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference.

In Battle Athletes, Akari Kanzaki (神崎 あかり), the protagonist of the story, but not the player, is a daughter of a former Cosmic Beauty who promised her mother on her deathbed to follow in her steps. Akari enrolls in a training school and strives to shape her body and become the next Cosmic Beauty. The story progresses one day at the time, leaving you to go through a half-year long training with Akari. The player can go to various areas in the school, talk to other characters, and perform daily training routines such as running, swimming, aerobics, and more. As Akari trains more, her physical characteristics improve, such as stamina, endurance, strength, and other. To check Akari's current stats, you can visit the school nurse to give you a rundown on her current condition. The game mostly plays as visual novel and features anime style videos and voice-acting. Characters during conversation are not animated in any way, but character portrait icons appear in various expressions to emphasize their posture during dialogues.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"AIC Spirits, JTS","Publisher":"Increment P","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"eb5ec05d-fcc9-4fef-a2da-52a13663e683.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"b7992b52-883b-43ca-949b-68e99b3f1394.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"e07caaa8-4fb8-4e7c-91fc-df0fff0ae0e0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"190682d6-8689-46ee-9937-cfe5b691294c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"337bf917-ec5f-4401-af5d-74ce2e89cf1e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"3bf542d6-ae46-4682-873c-73f411d35733.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"95fd9e0c-3a0d-4f47-8df6-f9395433165d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"5eaaef35-04a9-41fa-aebc-f34c990be3fb.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"cdafe03b-d725-496f-91de-be75e2be9b94.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"eb16d2e1-e952-427b-99d9-a472c288ec8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31369,"FileName":"a4941ff0-23b1-434c-bb42-ee538b0d8063.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25012,"Name":"Battle Garegga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Battle Garegga is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up arcade game.

The humour in the game is heavily influenced by the British comedy of Monty Python (the game starring former Monty Python actor Terry Jones) and thus includes plenty of mild sexual innuendos, and other shenanigans.\n \nWhile the video game leaves open the possibility for a sequel, no sequel for the game was planned.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5q40HgCBM","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"The Illusions Gaming Company","Publisher":"Crystal Dynamics","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"cf499906-2eda-4585-9b5f-dfc85fdd4618.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"c18bfd3e-f012-4952-90e2-3e2b597dd466.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"2a2838be-d907-4837-9ad9-ac85025232a7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"20d2d116-ec8e-4a5b-9bf2-0325af1a9a1a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"72109b34-db42-4559-9417-43c26d606d98.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"fff1a168-094e-4762-8533-627e0b23194f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"44e8521b-e1f1-4843-b588-4c6ac4bab549.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"ef261311-a1ad-4ec9-9d9e-4083c67dfea6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"25082d9a-1b72-40d3-a3d7-96be2c922a90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7935,"FileName":"8b0ba15d-e285-4964-b609-de1702e8a6cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7938,"Name":"Blazing Heroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mystaria: The Realms of Lore, originally released as Riglordsaga in Japan, is a strategy game developed by Sega and Microcabin for the Sega Saturn. Two versions of the game were released in the US: one titled Mystaria: The Realms of Lore and the other as Blazing Heroes.\n\nMystaria, once a land of peace and serenity, is now embroiled in turmoil. The evil Lord Bane and his ruthless band of marauders have overtaken the four kingdoms that rule this land. Now you must rely on the special powers of a Prince, a Ninja, a Lion man and others to reclaim your kingdoms and regain control of this beautiful land you once called your own! Breathtaking 3D graphics plus changing views and perspectives pull you into the action. Characters learn special attacks with each battle - over 250 attacks in all! Use a vast array of spells in your quest to conquer the evil Lord Bane and over 50 monsters and enemies.\n\nYou are Aragon, the prince of Mystaria. Long time ago, your father was one of the twelve mighty warriors who opposed Sith, the evil being that once tried to open the sacred portals of Mystaria. In the ultimate battle, your father was slain by Sith, but his eleven companion captured the villain and banished him, depriving him of his forces. Sith spend many years in a remote prison, until he grew powerful again. Now he came back to Mystaria and took over the kingdom. It is now up to Aragon to find eleven companions in order to be able to defeat evil again.\n\nThis is a strategy RPG along the lines of Shining Force series. Your party contains twelve characters, six of which can be used in battles. The turn-based battles are long and strategic - you move your characters on the battlefield, and the force of your attack depends on the amount of previous movement made by you. You can also use a variety of magic spells to hurt many enemies at the same time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud0kj50F8g0","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1995-07-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"00addb78-3f69-4b6e-b953-32724230df6b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"e2be6147-8441-484b-9463-b0363d23f00d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"fbddcd2d-5831-402d-a031-496d1f80dc33.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"7f80becc-7a41-4e3b-aed9-0e4b9400b8e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"6e5c979c-c8ab-40e3-8a60-59c8fe1a33a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"bc409017-933c-432e-9e32-9ebbf2187626.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"8124583c-0e74-4e2b-a63f-c1e15aaf7cc2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"a1d44dea-82fd-41dc-ba52-75aad54cf4da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"159306f6-f4de-40a5-9c91-0716452eed39.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"ca09c7a7-c925-4d6e-94db-03855bdc6b83.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"ce1442a3-feb1-45d1-87e0-1bef5abe0172.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"49876dec-d251-4826-b20d-741bcf6797d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"2377ec8c-516e-4a30-bf3e-ff5f2a8db9d2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"ecbff334-c369-48d2-9b80-4d66d099f95c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"b3391b22-a799-4ba4-9697-bb1e23ffc768.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"96a1e02f-00f5-4d83-937f-b50d94d9d72c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"26bdce6f-a588-42a8-ab91-20ed64731481.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"1748db08-99bd-472a-9716-2b8ab5f09a56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"FileName":"23ada905-3ad6-423d-8fa5-4e83acc7c421.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7938,"AlternateName":" Mystaria: The Realms of Lore ","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7938,"AlternateName":"Riglordsaga","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":31380,"Name":"Blue Breaker: Ken yorimo Hohoemi wo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The world of Blue Breaker is called \"the path in the middle of empty sky\": floating islands connected with each other by bridges.

His father explains to him that besides the usual warrior's goal of defeating the evil Dark Lord, Kain also has to find the girl of his dreams. He introduces to him a young sorceress named Asha, who becomes his first companion. But on his journey Kain meets many other young women, and it won't be so easy to choose one to whom he can give his heart!\n\nLabeled as Love Role-Playing, \"Blue Breaker\" is a genre-crossing game that combines traditional Japanese RPG with town and dungeon exploration, party-based combat, etc., with \"love adventure\", in which your behavior towards girls influences the story. \"Blue Breaker\" features branching story progressing: events appear depending on the progress you have made with your female companions. Your typical RPG activities will influence your relationship with the girls. For example, if you fight too much, the girls will be tired; if you give a girl too many orders in battle (you can set battle in auto mode and only interfere occasionally) she will be displeased, and so on. It is also important to form a party in which the girls will have as few internal conflicts with each other as possible.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOBFwkiFDB8","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"HuneX Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Human","ReleaseDate":"1997-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"c179802e-bc16-44ba-893f-0d6b19b82b38.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"896b04b8-44d6-4a08-9e86-7d09ecfc9c92.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"cec4c26b-77bf-4d9a-804f-a3a786b6a40d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"1ce6c82f-2484-4b77-b032-7ce02f7ce6a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"e30c9ca0-3edf-421c-bce0-8e1ca0c5f956.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"0feac7cb-38e2-482d-9dd8-4f657a16c9b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"b1b1b9aa-e426-4072-8683-94f57d337582.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31380,"FileName":"c15cd82f-9aca-47fe-a2cc-996eecca4040.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":31380,"AlternateName":"Blue Breaker: Ken Yori mo Hohoemi o","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":31382,"Name":"Blue Seed: Kushinada Hirokuden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long time ago, at the dawn of Japanese legendary history, the godly princess Kushinada defeated the Aragami, monsters who drew their power from an energy source called the Blue Seed.

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump from one platform to that above, or to the side, in a similar way to most platform games. The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated. Enemies turn \"angry\" – becoming pink-colored and moving faster – if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, but disappear once a player's life is lost. Contact with an enemy is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jvySs-IAbQ","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"a2312e26-03ec-4824-b3fe-9fd08bee4416.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"65e70b8a-f0ac-4ef9-8859-2da94fb64d5d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"a335ec3f-b289-4c68-9ea4-6e376b2bacfb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"63030309-0432-404f-a5ff-b35b1ff1b3b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"4a31687e-ca50-46f5-bb41-d8599f98c85d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"53aa3b0b-d2f8-4523-b301-7e0aeeb14d33.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"d18e99ea-a775-4ad9-b4a1-bbefdb8c4104.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"1b513045-70c3-4f3d-91db-4bcb44ac2977.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"e580c268-aa48-4694-9693-28e86aa0bda9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9197,"FileName":"d2f363c2-6ded-4b6d-9eb1-835ef3702dbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31386,"Name":"Bubble Symphony","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Bubble Symphony, you play one of four dragons - Bubblun, Bobblun, Kululun, and Cororon.

It is the fourth game in the Bubsy series as well as the first Bubsy game in 3D. A Sega Saturn version was in development for 1997, but never released. The game was released on November 25, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. The game's complete name is a play on words in reference to Forbidden Planet, a 1956 sci-fi film. The game follows Bubsy, an orange bobcat and the central character of the Bubsy series, who must stop a race of aliens known as the Woolies from stealing all of the Earth's yarn by traveling across their home planet of Rayon and collecting rocket pieces and atoms in order to build a rocket ship and return safely to Earth.\n\nA Sega Saturn version, known as Bubsy III in development, was also planned and would have apparently been based on the original Sega 32X development models. It was stated to come out in Winter 1996, as noted on GamePro Magazine, but was then stated to be delayed to Spring 1997 on Accolade's official website, and eventually cancelled outright due to the failure of the PlayStation version.\nCurrently, no prototypes of the Saturn port have resurfaced and very little info on the port exists (besides articles mentioning the game coming out on the Sega Saturn).\n\nhttps://bubsy.fandom.com/wiki/Bubsy_3D#:~:text=%20Bubsy%203D%20%201%20Gameplay.%20The%20objective,4%20Characters.%20%205%20Adversaries.%20%20More\nhttps://lostmediawiki.com/Bubsy_3D_(lost_Sega_Saturn_port_of_3D_platformer;_1996-1997)","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Eidetic","Publisher":"Accolade","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":199665,"FileName":"6766d841-bca6-434b-b702-09005ed3e17c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199665,"FileName":"a3a9f700-2b9a-480a-b03f-dc3408dad64b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199665,"FileName":"3c3e0f1f-1e9e-4bb9-833d-179941fb6a8e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199665,"FileName":"5a3fed6c-5b72-471a-aabc-a78e52eb7343.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199665,"FileName":"f2738db9-5dfa-456d-8a2f-001d6f69afdd.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":199665,"AlternateName":"Bubsy 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199665,"AlternateName":"Bubsy is 3D in Furbitten Planet","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":2400,"Name":"Bug Too!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bug Too! was a third person platform/adventure game, and has lots of console-style play mechanics.

It was entitled in Europe and North America as Bust-A-Move Again on the arcade and Bust-A-Move 2 on the home consoles. Released into the arcades in 1995, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PC conversions followed. The game was included in Taito Legends 2, but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead. The game is a spin-off from Bubble Bobble.\n\nThe game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta.\n\nSome versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other.\n\nCompletion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"Acclaim Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"aaf1636c-765b-4679-8497-ad5e9f680455.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"954e7bf7-b839-45f5-b0df-4f9538963b6e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"7a0b2076-9e59-4604-8b0b-90fbd9881dce.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"bf6d2300-19f6-4148-bffd-4342abeb3659.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"83313bd6-68dd-4d20-9cbf-29b0fb40ef27.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"0cd5a729-eed1-4bc9-a06c-1a6a03dfe53c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"d8627a03-8ac7-45fd-93ce-e33547161704.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"c5779947-21f4-4cab-a003-8567f828af5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"70ff310d-18e2-4c50-800b-e441ff7ba768.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"f580e163-8a98-4f78-b299-1f72f85fc369.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"13c3049b-c032-44ce-85e0-58f9181bac3f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"4abf72d8-a074-4d66-bbad-34f1941358e0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"0fa7e7ca-7e50-4aa3-bd0e-b8d7c8bf554d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10571,"FileName":"6596b9bc-3df4-4152-9954-06ab25ea377b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10571,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble 2x","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":2459,"Name":"Bust-A-Move 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Link 3 or more colored bubbles by shooting an identical colored bubble. When they are joined together, they pop.\n\nThis game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"47811c1f-d88e-477d-ae7f-a559a28012a9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"46d64e55-fb9a-4b76-a170-177a56ca0e31.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"880aabc5-c377-4bab-99f8-3a44ff723e8b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"c7a050eb-9ca6-4dee-9186-76480b1eac43.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"6e25132d-9198-4f5b-ba61-2155071b4588.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"4b63a76e-fd80-46fa-ad6c-a4c854bf6db3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"c296e7cc-eb0d-4644-b952-67d52963b9da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"b2d8e9e7-3787-473a-8ffe-29f43ac6bb74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"a37781f7-ca98-460d-b64d-c682d413c1fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"6e5cc7d8-a0c3-4d86-a89d-3ef1f654071f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"FileName":"3d01b3e4-9601-4859-91d5-6a5705909327.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":2459,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble 3","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2459,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble 3 for SegaNet","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":31387,"Name":"Can Can Bunny Extra","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The fifth Can Can Bunny game is also the first direct sequel within the series. The story is very similar to the one of the previous game: once again, the hero is lonely and is anxious to get a girlfriend, or, to be more precise, to have sex with different girls. And once again, the benevolent and gorgeous goddess Swatty is here to provide assistance, together with her side-kicks, the Seven Lucky Gods from the Japanese mythology.\n\nEven though the story is pretty much the same as in the previous game, the gameplay underwent significant enhancements. The interface is still traditional Japanese-style menu commands, but there are many more locations now, many of which can be freely accessed by clicking on them while on the main map. Once the player has reached the point where he can begin the physical seduction of the girl, the interface switches to point-and-click, with context-sensitive cursor for touching, kissing, etc. It is necessary to try different actions more than once to understand what the girl considers pleasant and what not, otherwise the girl might get angry and the game will be over. There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously). There are also various extras (as the title implies), including an extensive album that arranges various pictures of the girls so that they tell her story, and an additional collection of stories, in which the hero can learn more about the girls he had met in the main game, and even interact with them again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"KID","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"db42d016-1cc4-44e4-a487-3a192d330860.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"89411e7c-7def-465c-bdaf-83b09e7bf54c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"524b3902-5b0b-4470-a0a1-a0bd4edd4374.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"04c6abd1-8ab2-4d26-8280-7cfae359330e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"bedd95b9-aeab-44a3-8f38-5f4d31c92da4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"edbf9507-002a-4e87-9b1b-6e0c45f1237b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31387,"FileName":"4bac95f6-59f1-4a59-b7ae-f53a86f8ab3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31392,"Name":"Can Can Bunny Premiere","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant.

It was released overseas (albeit only on PlayStation) under the title of Street Fighter Collection 2 (a sequel to Street Fighter Collection), said version being the only game in the Capcom Generation line to see release in North America (European PlayStation owners later got a compilation titled Capcom Generations, which was a 4-disc set of the other four Capcom Generation games) \n\nIncluded is the one that started it all, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, and the two improved editions, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, known as Dash and Dash Turbo in Japan respectively.\n\nStreet Fighter II: The World Warrior features all the basic features that would be carried over to subsequent Street Fighter II editions. The original game features eight selectable characters, with Ryu and Ken being the only characters with identical moves. In the single-player tournament, the player faces the other seven main characters, before proceeding to the final four opponents, which are non-selectable boss characters. Matches can go up to ten rounds if there is no clear winner before making the player lose by default (in Champion Edition and onward, this is reduced to four rounds).\n\nThe most significant change to Street Fighter II: Champion Edition is the ability to play as the four boss characters, as well as allowing two players to select the same fighter, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode is increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork is redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds are recolored. Much of the gameplay is revised to balance the characters out.\n\nFinally, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting is a minor update released in response to the proliferation of modified bootlegs of Champion Edition. Released on December 1992 (eight months after Champion Edition), Hyper Fighting increases the game speed and adds new special techniques for some of the fighters such as Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport and Chun-Li's Kikoken. All of the characters receive new color schemes, with the new scheme becoming the default and the original color scheme as the alternate for all characters except M. Bison, who still uses his original color scheme as the default and the new scheme as the alternate.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"CAPCOM Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"a744d46e-3a9f-4f7a-ba71-986bbeba5663.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"727d12cc-dc29-4a66-9eab-2159ea9aa36b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"13b520ea-637d-4bde-9e6d-944ac9726a74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"875c8b9f-e435-4027-abea-b91ff65c5f86.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"9bdff637-2788-4a09-af4e-3c40b3b58ceb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"cb867c2f-515b-40d9-8ffc-1077102d6166.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"efc1e521-009b-436d-a20c-52bb4e491294.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31399,"FileName":"185de2d9-1798-4a1c-852f-fdca8a450865.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":31399,"AlternateName":"Capcom Generation: Dai-5-shuu Kakutouka-tachi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":10572,"Name":"Casper","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hey!

If there's no voice to wake them up anymore then the toys will never live again, so Pepper and Ginger head off to find Chelsea before it's too late.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns8aVsCMP1E","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"AM7","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-09T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"1ad966f5-2612-4873-8cd3-36c6ac8b0f16.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"b2a45474-2381-4da3-8dc3-b072d55d5572.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"7ab615fd-2974-412d-bb9c-e28a6d591120.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"704fd8c5-85de-4e5a-ba66-bb4f1f7cc8f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"1e3dd308-3701-4a85-8a67-7c46001ca172.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"430079bc-9c01-4615-829f-5e0dd6915112.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"1f7192d5-a784-4695-b588-ed14801dc3f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"9a979a6a-5edf-43a8-9247-d9a5522afb0c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"04d7fd6f-4d0d-4e19-a84b-f27c6135b9de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"e43c92be-ab60-4f46-b0c0-003658fd8f40.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"3468745e-bc64-45a1-b2aa-e4c9a85d46fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"cb6a4bd9-05cb-4bd2-99fc-f69bab64b67f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"4adda2b6-d219-4f28-9494-7fe90eb76e63.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"6189324c-2e7a-4220-ba31-c7ccbb237e54.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9981,"FileName":"27e4edbc-133e-4d6e-ae48-92b1419349ce.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9981,"AlternateName":"Clockwork Knight: Pepperouchau's Adventure","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9981,"AlternateName":"Clockwork Knight: Pepperouchau no Daibouken Joukan","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":9984,"Name":"Clockwork Knight 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Clockwork Knight 2 uses identical gameplay to that of its predecessor, right down to using all the same items and having four rooms with three levels each, plus a final boss.\n \nHowever, there are three minor additions:\n Four playing cards are scattered around each level.

You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance...\n\nCrusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map.\n\nBetween missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"be3eaa85-814d-4349-8b4c-d83ddde9005f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"0a52ad23-a811-41cf-9531-2a5f1134132c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"8faad960-5e33-488d-8e67-705b9d938325.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"19e2c1a0-0165-42cd-b119-8ebc391862d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"dfce2e2a-7ac2-4309-9a6e-39a6459120be.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"c6dfb321-385f-4cb0-80ec-013059395a5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"99306d08-c6e5-47d0-bab9-d31b3eeaa57e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"9f88033c-af53-448b-a358-f5ea423e9b8d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"47b24723-6fd9-42bb-9ae9-c78eb62fa3da.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"112bd68e-7f93-4918-88f2-d2d225b9c2ce.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14421,"FileName":"1f88caa0-8af6-4b95-ba88-14d37f0c7216.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10582,"Name":"Crypt Killer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Crypt Killer is a horror-themed lightgun shooter.

Some enemies throw projectiles like knives or bones at you, so be sure to aim at those as well. If the screen becomes too crowded, clear it with a smartbomb. At the end of some acts, you can choose from one of two paths through the next act, giving you different ways of completing a stage. At the end of each stage, a boss enemy awaits.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"1691791f-51af-4e90-9f13-5f7cba6bbe21.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"277fc7b8-8ad0-4ca8-9f30-3b4415cd881d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"3949ac39-4510-4b59-970f-a2d606cf2f16.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"10010c96-cf73-400c-8dec-1bd94b64379b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"37dc5564-9149-4c7b-9cad-d648e1c75879.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"1e6b9ffe-97b9-4cd8-9a2d-61be39666e23.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"b74a6730-9273-4727-a85b-97a3fd522177.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"cccf7627-100b-4f96-b042-2de933047d76.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"d8bc19f8-e29d-42d8-8d84-6f299c977422.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"cf0770fd-2593-412f-893e-fee09549fc7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"0164cf10-9145-4889-8f6e-e63577748c2b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"38d16adb-ce0a-4d87-89c5-626c29e9f742.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"a46e3b7d-a862-4098-bb95-4a42e7adc031.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"43f6377d-2434-4e06-a88a-645654ac4b33.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10582,"FileName":"d3217848-b8c6-41fa-a604-5587a8a5e51b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10582,"AlternateName":"Henry Explorers ","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":123602,"Name":"Cube Battler: Anna Mirai-hen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Cube Battler: Anna Mirai-hen (キューブバトラー アンナ未来編) is a puzzle game for the Sega Saturn.

The player navigates Garian through 3D environment, but the view switches to isometric perspective once a fight is triggered.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Climax Entertainment","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"a5d64096-2f91-4aca-99d5-eacacc752351.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"661314c1-745b-48c4-a194-180368ca2c4c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"5ef31472-e40e-4d4f-973d-12d24330dfad.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"2f2bcb88-6b16-4ab2-b145-9140d10c692e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"c8c6a2c2-6a24-4c2c-bec5-8c8e2dade662.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"eee7f127-e18a-4a32-b2a0-71be7d751a77.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"cca0e170-4e56-411b-a6ec-07e0e97d99c3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"dedb059e-9e61-4585-bca5-be4bad400de8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"303f7a82-e297-4f14-97f6-6872ba002b5d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"6e4f8eb2-23f4-4cd6-b9bf-7388da33a432.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"f66cabe3-b178-478c-bb51-d7e774990c58.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"f5b4eb51-68d0-48fe-9812-0cd7ff1a6a0f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"6046abc9-096e-46c8-be6e-dcc8dcde0602.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"ea73fb9e-0141-4e27-b895-009a4fed6865.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"4e2ffda1-f0a7-417c-abfe-ee8b8bdbc17a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"a1648c97-f045-4a74-b0ca-29ba13404c62.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"ef0cebbf-2972-4c88-91da-de202f911597.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"cdaf85ef-c2a8-4698-b4ef-2cb27851d330.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"9fb5dd85-259d-4316-ad56-b205e4ba4d47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11227,"FileName":"109f9cef-2e04-4e31-889d-21abc1b5bf35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125697,"Name":"Dark Seed","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dark Seed is an adventure game which capitalizes on the drawings of famous horror designer H.

In this game, you play the part of a contemporary human fighter pilot abducted by the alien Repton species during your aerial battle, and biologically modified to become a starfighter pilot for them in their war against the Evil Ovon race.\n\nIn the game itself, you would usually pilot one of three different starfighters, each with different strengths and weaknesses, along with occasionally piloting a captured enemy ship, or controlling a gun turret on your Mothership (The \"War Drum\"). The missions are quite varied, ranging from simple combat missions to missions where you need to defend your mothership, destroy an enemy Ovon mothership, clear an asteroid field, or retrieve an object with a tractor beam. Your ship moves between mission areas via \"hyperspace portals\", passing through a hyper-space environment, resembling that seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often during hyperspace transit, varying streams of energy are encountered - yellow energy replenishing the energy which fuels the ship, while blue energy drains it, reducing the ship's effectiveness.\n\nAfter you complete the four campaigns and destroy the Ovon home-world for the Reptons, they reward you by sending their best pilots to kill you in an honorable way (after all, they don't need a human in their society and war history). You manage to escape and jump to Earth, where centuries have passed since you were gone. Your ship is greeted by the Earth Defense Fleet, which destroys all Repton ships in hot pursuit.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Rage Games Ltd.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"3063d1b4-28f8-49a9-bcda-58533e834835.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"11f739e1-cb2c-4c3f-9186-1990fbc84ac2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"b1fed799-14a1-4b17-a17d-519118830e40.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"04a08b16-5a45-4fb4-9b4c-e3fcb8d52bef.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"fa3e2f2e-c232-4c0e-abc3-206a0ce06a60.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"677223c2-c067-4487-8ec5-607759d2d778.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"06418d4f-fdd0-4e6a-9266-08c199bbd5ac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"82a4dc9c-2495-4716-9ef9-268a630706ad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"a26579ef-7946-482a-a504-523d03057ab2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11228,"FileName":"aa6e1cd2-d9c6-4a17-99ce-943647407368.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13043,"Name":"Daytona USA","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sega's premier stock car racing game comes to the Dreamcast with DAYTONA USA.

The PlayStation release, handled by Asmik, is called Hard Rock Cab and is almost identical to this version (though is censored with green blood as opposed to red).\n\nDeath Throttle is similar to Crazy Taxi, with the player driving a taxi and moving people to and from various locations on the map. However, due to its age, the game is played on a flat surface similar in nature to Wolfenstein 3D. The taxi is equipped with guns, allowing you to shoot other vehicles. It is also possible to run over pedestrians, similar to the Grand Theft Auto or Carmageddon franchises.\n\nThe Saturn version of the game (much like its PlayStation counterpart) sports improved lighting and more detailed textures, but has a lower frame rate than the PC original. Essential text has also been translated into Japanese (though live action cutscenes and non-essential features remain in English).\n\nQuarantine/Death Throttle was followed by the PC game Road Warrior, released in 1995.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Infini","Publisher":"MediaQuest","ReleaseDate":"1996-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140735,"FileName":"4b90e807-0dda-4e71-8b0c-62bf08706da3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140735,"FileName":"7798ada6-fc96-4afa-9f26-edfe89618ee8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140735,"FileName":"0af357b3-a040-4014-b4e2-4aa182e2439b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140735,"FileName":"78811867-ec18-4eb3-be77-bbea54a6fe90.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140735,"FileName":"0aae1b35-b725-43f7-826c-839b6633336a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":140735,"AlternateName":"Death Throttle: Kakuzetsu Toshi Kara no Dasshutsu","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":164374,"Name":"DeathMask","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Angel Devoid: Face of the Enemy is a 1996 FMV based tech noir graphic adventure game developed by Electric Dreams Inc. and released by Mindscape for MS-DOS and Mac OS.

(Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! in North America) is the second point-and-click adventure game based on Terry Pratchett's series of fantasy novels set on the mythical Discworld. The game was developed and produced in 1996 by Perfect Entertainment for the PC, and ported in 1997 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was published by Psygnosis for the PC and PlayStation, and by Sega for the Saturn (only in Europe).\n\nMortality Bytes casts players again in the role of Rincewind, from the first game.\n\nDeath, the grim reaper, who normally ushers the Discworld inhabitants into the afterlife, is on an extended vacation. This means that those whose \"time is up\" are faltering around in limbo. Now it's up to Rincewind to bring him back or suffer the fate of immortality.\n\nGameplay is divided into 4 Acts. There are many locations to explore and a multitude of obstacles in Rincewind's path to overcome. Conversations with characters and interaction with inventory objects is necessary to move ahead.\n\nThe game features unique humour similar to the previous game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHGyqn6BcuI","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Perfect Entertainment","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":11234,"FileName":"8d17062e-6235-435e-837f-d8e559929dbf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11234,"FileName":"ab97e850-e0fb-4e77-80e0-77478dd8d65c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11234,"FileName":"ed9235ac-464d-41ef-9211-0c7594f67fa7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11234,"FileName":"0d2021ca-77b2-477e-804c-086d6282c0f1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11234,"FileName":"849a3100-fa60-4b70-b70f-9779b60924c5.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":140738,"Name":"DJ Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"DJ Wars (ＤＪウォーズ) is a Sega Saturn rhythm game.

In order to defeat Madruk, Astea created a powerful dragon, who eventually emerged victorious and was able to seal Madruk away.\n\nYears have passed. Legendra is now divided into eight kingdoms. One of them, Fandaria, is ruled by a monarch named Goldark. The other kings have heard rumors that Goldark is planning to take over Legendra by conquering all the other kingdoms. Everyone is preparing for the war, without realizing that the ancient evil is about to raise its head once again...\n\nDragon Force is a real-time strategy game (RTS). The player can choose one of the six monarchs (plus two additional ones that become available once the game is completed) with their unique scenarios. The gameplay is divided into three modes: management, overworld movement, and battle. Management mode allows the player to assign generals, decide the fate of prisoners, prepare the army for battles, etc. Navigation on the map is done in real time; once two warring armies have reached the same spot, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. The battles also evolve in real time, the goal usually being killing or capturing enemy general. If all the soldiers are killed, the two generals can opt for a duel that will decide the outcome of the battle.\n\nEach kingdom has unique \"strong\" fighter types, which the player should use to target the weaknesses of the opposing armies. Each fighter type also has his own special techniques and abilities.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIdlvWIvSe0","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Working Designs","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"57550119-b63d-4ece-a4f5-0c0211f7f7dc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"cfa51f86-5e12-460b-8968-09de8f28db56.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"2ecfebd1-d0df-4bc8-9cd2-26bed3ba44e2.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"e16b480a-227c-41ce-93b3-7543c04e0237.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"5897c557-e6d1-4474-a7e2-bd9621764d8d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"bf85c88f-ac9d-47d9-8aed-5e3d23e561bf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"87ea93c3-9b55-4b5f-ac86-6bdfffbb7ad5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"04cdcfad-7de6-4c38-bb03-1cc6b35ada74.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"371a3b73-e058-44de-8dde-0a7555f9fd7c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"9961defc-929e-45e6-9821-e8d041321cae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"1dcf9ea7-b9a1-4432-9663-93a546c6556b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"b803a127-5f41-4df3-9a78-c69ae13f702f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"30dacacd-3de7-4e0e-a1ce-3c4019e001b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"84829566-bffe-4055-86e8-b266b0809c8c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"256f61ed-8cac-4a25-9aa3-ac2f46224103.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"f2f7160f-547a-49f9-839f-49fb6404e826.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"68e8d0b3-5873-46a2-81e4-51660985af0c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"914c59d6-436e-4375-bb64-4a459588bde0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"aa8c22a8-fbec-476e-a383-2585c8a28c37.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"f29373ea-10c2-48b6-a88b-94a067e963b5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"6a1a53e8-581f-4d4e-9bf5-d385ec0667b1.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"0e9c10f4-6ce9-42ce-8e44-f0f263da81f2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"f14c73ba-ef68-4ee3-8846-128187529464.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11171,"FileName":"2eddd2fd-7b86-4a56-b72b-ef1666c4fc20.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23766,"Name":"Dragon Force II: The Godforsaken Land","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Force (ドラゴンフォース) is a real-time strategy and tactics video game from Sega created for the Sega Saturn.

After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduces a first-person perspective to the series and turns the game into a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.\n\nDuke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers dollars to have them remove their top.\n\nThe main character regularly delivers commentary on the events through one-liners. There are twenty-eight levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, night vision, protective boots, a hologram known as the \"holoduke\", and a jetpack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.\n\nThe game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"3D Realms","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"253e9264-1055-41ca-9f93-1c176f9288fc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"14e69710-d538-44de-b495-5d2a21edc034.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"5694a3e9-ff90-4fd6-ad13-9c8a205e8989.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"f8317b14-2e27-4953-a6d7-1def2630c108.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"a400f967-e8db-45a3-b93e-eee89da1cdb4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"dfd18d33-e099-4b8c-8b87-47b8a8866506.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"8549181d-44f6-4d1c-81e3-81eef7f047f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"50e9e4dc-23ad-4b76-ac82-2ce70b0dc345.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"a0d30a9c-6250-4393-ba90-627e0b449b46.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"28f6f1fd-1a84-4d77-959a-b476ec12d922.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"a00f68dd-c35a-4e09-b5da-9e5df7154cc0.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"5bee06b1-29f2-4dad-8595-45dff158b4d9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"1380118b-274d-42a5-8863-c4ec23bbc50a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5688,"FileName":"14464ab5-3f9b-4351-b00e-23b9b07af20a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":140740,"Name":"Dungeon Master Nexus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dungeon Master Nexus is the first game in the Dungeon Master series using a 3D graphics engine.

At the start of the game, you choose one of three characters, Kart Bradfield, Edie Burrett, and Jad the Taff. Each of them has their strengths and weaknesses, as well as different primary and secondary weapons. Your mission is to obtain the computer data that are hidden behind specially marked doors (colored red) in six buildings. Entering blue-colored doors during the game will trigger a spinning wheel that contains various items, and when you hit the fire button, what it stops on is what you get. These include point items, health items, machine guns, and rocket launchers. As with the original game, you can use elevators to travel between floors.\n\nYou can shoot various objects to destroy them, including barrels and drums, which can help defeat various enemies that include lackeys, zombie soldiers, karate agents, trench-coat goons, guard dogs, and more. Avoid being shot by these enemies. There are cameras scattered throughout each building, which can be destroyed. If you are sighted by one of these cameras, a brief siren goes off. You have limited time to clear each building. When time runs out, the building blows up and you lose a life.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL_W3iyzK60","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"03b378a1-a70c-4c19-bbd9-6c8e755b97b5.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"81b6e5b3-59a4-4bab-9256-9ccb5b5ce7f9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"eb0b7acc-23cd-407f-bf39-78e0155dbe8c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"56f23bba-2075-4e65-8ea9-4fc17c7969cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"a7907b72-4e78-4f7a-8070-d5ad5868a11c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"c61d72c5-61ad-44f5-9208-6ca4c22413e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"db160f82-373d-43d9-80ea-54fab4a5770f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"8e830193-d141-44c2-b377-00a0bc6994f5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"83d23654-ef75-4545-98d4-44120b5fe3bd.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":30117,"FileName":"235b7ba3-ec2b-4b6d-be1a-49908aef0b49.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":30117,"AlternateName":"Elevator Action^2: Returns","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":175075,"Name":"Elf o Karu Monotachi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Elf wo Karu Monotachi (エルフを狩るモノたち) is an adventure game for the Sega Saturn.

It also features the same heroine as in D series.\n\nThe crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.\n\nThe game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5swQxSG-jRw","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Warp","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"49bad33d-aae6-4f7c-a1d6-d0e16987afdc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"3b9229a1-75cb-45eb-ae06-a98212c46e20.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"570fb41b-e4db-4aa5-b5c4-69aa7e4b2183.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"6ac05640-9cc9-4c74-b704-efd780f0db69.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"7647cfbf-bf31-4c32-9176-86e435089c05.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"c329814c-41c9-47c2-a277-cd4e53932d94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"c3012baa-70b5-4d16-b78b-323b93c99c6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"46660d2f-efa1-47e3-a768-c76d389c0d75.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"530d2b3b-6301-41e0-acf8-c4c2924579a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"40158463-9abb-4aef-a5bd-60311f80098c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"21e4a7fa-23dc-4479-b34f-25882633e0e7.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"e1eded0a-6450-4003-b62a-461b865c8698.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14422,"FileName":"dfdf2619-20da-4825-8e81-b26d62ba6941.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157012,"Name":"Eternal Melody","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Eternal Melody (エターナルメロディ) is a simulation game developed by Starlight Marry and published by Media Works for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Starlight Marry, MediaWorks","Publisher":"MediaWorks","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157012,"FileName":"73e8b8a3-8877-4531-a592-3750f9de52d8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157012,"FileName":"817a0f01-9da1-4fb1-8ba0-18571d712b9e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157012,"FileName":"49663777-c112-4de9-8cf8-88cf20446d2e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157012,"FileName":"0472b0a1-fe6d-4170-8e77-9af8286aa00a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157012,"FileName":"bb2c35d9-4de0-456c-84da-dd550aa14873.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174275,"Name":"E'tude Prologue: Yureugoku Kokoro no Katachi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A coastal town called \"South Aose\".\n\nSurrounded by the sea and mountains, a place like anywhere where lots of nature still remains.\nTwo normal high school students go to school in that town.\n\nThe special winter of the 3rd year of school.

Both PS2 versions, however, do not feature adult CG event scenes, but are fully voiced and have a new opening animation whereas Sega Saturn version does not feature an opening animation.\n\nThis is the first game in the Dousoukai series and starts with you on your way to a nice resort to reunite with some of your classmates from high-school. In particular, your tennis team members. The game focuses on romance and features full map of the place you're staying at as well as the rural town and its surrounding area. The game occurs through one week time and lets you visit any location on the map during both daytime and nighttime, which advances the time. An icon of a character marks when someone is at some location, but not who the person is. This visual novel features typical static anime characters sprites with light animation such as talking animations, pasted over background images. CG event scenes occur with the right character at the right place and time.

However, the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three plane format known as the Oversway System. The player fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or \"oversway\" into either of the sway lines at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a \"Quick Sway\" to avoid an attack, leaving the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack.\n\nOther new techniques introduced in this installment includes controlling the height of the character's jump, block an opponent's attack at mid-air (Air Guard), and a new type of combo techniques known as Combination Arts, allowing the player to cancel a specific series (which varies between characters) of regular attacks from one to the other. In addition to the regular Special Moves, and the Super Special Moves which can only be performed when the life gauge is flashing red, each character also has a \"Hidden Ability\", which is a stronger version of a Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability occurs once in every 1024 chances whenever the player inputs the command for the character's Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability can also be used by activating \"Super Mode\" before a match using a secret code. The player then enters a specific command for the Hidden Ability when the life gauge is flashing red. Unlike Super Special Moves, a Hidden Ability can only be used once per round.\n\nFatal Fury 3 also features a Fighting Level system when fighting against the computer. When the player completes a round, their performance is graded from D to SSS. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the Single Player Mode is determined then by the player's average.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxjfpc3R86o","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"9806c7a0-aea8-4e5a-bdc7-8188b003f03d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"5bce9c92-aa37-471e-8f64-4b0cf8909871.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"92559e8f-22eb-45c5-8c74-4f3b6946fc87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"5e97eff7-0ae0-4cd6-b863-0c362c2de2f5.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"0aa72a65-c768-4c06-8f2a-4dcc1c48833d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"14475df8-52d0-4aba-9fef-50435679d4a6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137591,"FileName":"5d00e0d3-9862-479e-9dee-79b7a47a9dc4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":137591,"AlternateName":"Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":140852,"Name":"Gebockers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hyper 3D Taisen Battle Gebockers is a simplistic 3D shooting game.

The story involves time travel, with the heroes following the villain through their period (future from our perspective), world war period, present, and two future periods.\n\nThree ship types, titled Type A, B and C are available. Depending on player 1 and 2 side, the pilot also looks different.\n\nIn typical shooting game manner, there is one button for firing and one for bombs. Bombs are very strong and destroy most standard enemies and bullets instantly. Power ups increase shot strength and add extra weapons: Homing, Laser and Napalm, with the latter being the objectively best weapon in the game.\n\nThe game adds score based on collected medals and remaining bombs at the end of each stage.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Japan Media Programming","Publisher":"Virgin Interactive","ReleaseDate":"1997-04-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"8ad063a6-fc7a-4d14-bdad-6c90a12b4abf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"434ed701-b172-4ab4-a8b7-d51521415ac2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"9233663a-c788-41fd-8532-42c861147714.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"1a60d8c3-8430-40ae-ae91-8a55b532d7c2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"5f5501c7-5d6f-40aa-861e-e1930c0932a1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"1a5c72cf-2c7b-46ce-a5c8-4f5f62f902c9.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140853,"FileName":"3aa6726a-df8f-44e4-800e-ca6d98b1f0ef.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":140853,"AlternateName":"Gekirindan","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":140854,"Name":"Gekitotsu Koushien","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gekitotsu Koushien is a super deep high school baseball tournament simulator.

The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?\n\nSuikoden is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also a few army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights (duels).\n\nThe game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress. 108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in \"Water Margins\". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1998-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"2cfceef8-ff08-4d91-8a14-3d5b764566f6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"07c3f651-80a1-4142-9db5-4f62144b5e7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"a6633b8c-6eb9-4a33-8f95-daef8e5c8aa8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"f5051c58-5589-453a-9775-12e06c28f67e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"ac22964b-f9f3-4a44-b225-5d4f08a4d844.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"0b12c504-683c-49ba-aa4f-654b21c3c5ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"406470ab-6f7d-45b3-bd30-0a656f6676fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146549,"FileName":"97226f5c-b2d4-412a-9d75-e1b03dbfa16b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11247,"Name":"Gex","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"GEX's mouth gets him in trouble, but it's his thrashing tail and suction cup paws that get him out.

The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.\n\nThe game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around \"historical\" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.\n\nThe combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually takes control of a \"home planet\", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map. Enemies typically appear after a few turns; depending on the goal, the player must prevent them from invading planets, destroy them, have his own ships invade a planet, etc.\n\nThe space ships come in different flavors: high-speed battle ships, cruisers, supply ships, etc. Each ship has different mobility, attack range, weapons, defense parameters, etc. Actual combat is displayed on a separate screen and is automatic. The player usually has a choice to use different weapons (cannons, missiles, etc.) against the enemy ships.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Micro Vision Software","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157031,"FileName":"82ea56cb-e797-4aa0-ae93-14b64420f396.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157031,"FileName":"cc4c246b-b13b-4673-a5da-dd134e184079.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157031,"FileName":"b2aea16b-73f3-41ef-b86c-7d7cd36c61c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157031,"FileName":"f6613a86-5c18-433f-a50b-6b828b6282d2.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":172594,"Name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Plus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Plus (銀河英雄伝説 ＰＬＵＳ) is an update to Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Micro Vision","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":172594,"FileName":"1d7208de-c159-4747-8ad5-38f58c1cd0ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":172594,"FileName":"e6a0d3ad-a95a-4631-934d-c45ea0f1443f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":172594,"FileName":"61b4b350-aa3b-45c1-81a1-ce62a54fbe8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":172594,"FileName":"cc3136a1-b84f-43e6-b1d8-edf578c7567e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157032,"Name":"Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna 3: Lightning Angel","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna 3: Lightning Angel (銀河お嬢様伝説ユナ３ ～ライトニング・エンジェル～) is an adventure game developed by Red and published by Hudson for the Sega Saturn.

The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.\n\nGrand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.\n\nGrand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.\n\nOther highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:\n\n- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.\n\n- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Burst","Publisher":"Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"9e5186c7-5d54-452d-9580-7dd9c76cb0af.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"5d639398-386c-40f8-86fa-725ea912d448.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"8da93d61-d343-4713-af45-06fbc44649c6.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"e6d11220-6cb9-404b-bff1-bf237dfc4b1b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"fdaa959b-baea-46f8-86cc-8f6583c0d93e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"f2f75fec-77e9-40b2-848f-9d6ba9502cfb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"d8fd4996-5bb3-4818-a30c-b176719e309a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11248,"FileName":"7b79d69b-153e-4ed3-8776-765d41266276.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29729,"Name":"Grandia","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The ancient Angelou civilization has ceased to exist centuries ago, and technology in the world develops rapidly. General Baal, the head of the militaristic Garlyle Forces, organizes an excavation of ancient ruins, apparently for philanthropic reasons. Meanwhile, Justin, a young boy from the nearby town of Parm, decides to investigate the ruins in search of the Spirit Stone, an artefact that once belonged to his missing father. A mysterious holographic image tells him that he should travel to faraway lands to discover the stone's true power, and he embarks on the most dangerous adventure of his life without hesitation.\n\nGrandia is a Japanese-style role-playing game. The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons. The game makes use of anime-style cutscenes to advance the story. Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles. Battles occur in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.\n\nThe characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.

Neither could win, and eventually the Sky Spirits bestowed some humans with their powers, turning them into wizards and allies in the war. The Earth Spirits were banished into darkness; but the Sky Spirits feared the human wizards and cast them underground as well.\n\nYears have passed, and a powerful wizard named Kanon escaped from the gloomy prison and turned the human land into a puppet state trembling before his might. One legendary sword is said to bring an end to Kanon's reign. Four warriors - Han, Randy, Nicole and Ginjirou - retrieved the sword, but knights sent by Kanon are determined to take it away and destroy it at all costs. Aided by the renegade knight Serena, the four heroes must keep the world safe and protect themselves against the onslaught.\n\nGuardian Heroes is a hybrid of a side-scrolling beat-em-up and a role-playing game. The four initial player characters are distinguished by their attributes and abilities: Han is a strong fighter who cannot use magic; Randy is a sorcerer who can cast attack spells but is physically more vulnerable; Ginjirou is a ninja-type, agile character; finally, Nicole has weak attacks but can cast healing spells.\n\nThe fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than in most other games of this type, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way as usually in fighting games), magical attacks and the ability to block. Defeating enemies yields experience points, with which the player can upgrade the characters between levels, sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.\n\nThe game has a branching storyline that develops according to the player's selection of stages. There is also a \"Karma\" system that evaluates the player's actions depending on how he or she treats enemies or innocent people in the game world.\n\nEven in one-player mode there are always two controllable characters on screen - the player commands the other character by changing his \"mood\" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six.

Irem themselves would eventually produce a PS1 sequel in 1996: Gussun Paradise, known in Europe as Yoyo's Puzzle Park.\n\nThe core gameplay of the series is to help Gussun and his brother Oyoyo (Vic and Vinnie respectively in Risky Challenge) escape a flooding stage by building a stairway with Tetris blocks. The goal is to reach the ceiling before the water level drowns the pair. Gussun and Oyoyo move independently based on their AI, similar to the titular rodents of Lemmings, and the player needs to anticipate their AI pathing and their habit of occasionally freaking out whenever scary things happen.\n\nIn addition, the player can often choose between Emily and George as their \"cheerleader\". Emily is a young woman who frequently changes costumes while George (originally Yousame) is a buff bodybuilder.

You, Takeshi Gouda (郷田 武史), as a professional photographer came, along with your team which includes Ryouichi Akada (赤田 良一), your editor, and Takuya Sasaki (佐々木 拓也), your young assistant, to make a photo album of that very idol group. As you arrive at the boarding house you meet with Otomegumi idol group consisting of Rei, Maki, and Shouko, as well as with some other suspicious looking characters on the premise. Due to a sudden storm, you decide to wait it out and use that opportunity to get to know everyone a little better. But the evening doesn't go as well as expected and some unpleasant words are exchanged with Seiji Tashiro (田代 成治), an idol group manager. Ryouichi had to step in a couple of time to prevent things from escalating, but by the time everyone went to bed it all seemed to have quiet down.\n\nNext morning, you, the idol group, Ryouichi, Takuya, and Chieko Naemura (苗村 千恵子) who is a stylist for Otomegumi idol group all went to hot springs for some photo session. The photos are going fine and things were about to wrap up when the distressing rumor about someone being dead back at the boarding house have reached you. You all pack your things and head back to the boarding house. There, you find the owners of the boarding house, Kyousuke Nakagawa (中川 京介) and his wife Reiko Nakagawa (中川 麗子), standing in front of a room of none other than Seiji Tashiro who was a troublemaker since the moment you met him. At closer inspection you soon realize it's a murder as he appears to have been stabbed with a knife. But who would have a reason to kill him? Suspects... motives... opportunities... anyone could be the killers, and to top it all, you cannot call the police as phone line appears to be dead. With the killer among you, what was to be a nice relaxing vacation is turning into a murder mystery that is far from being over.\n\nThe game plays like a straight visual novel consisting of text over current background which is comprised on many photo stills to match the dialogue and emotion of the scene in question. Occasionally the player is presented with dialogue choices which may affect the current situation but there is no real branching in the main story, just different reactions by the people addressing you. Voice-acting is almost non-present and appears only in key dialogues between the player and the idols, and usually for no more than a single short sentence. In photo session player can take a limited number of photos but does not control camera movement, instead, camera moves up and down once and the player has the chance to take a photo or keep the movie to use on the next pose.

The game also counts with a system that lets you execute special actions during a match, but these have to be \"exchanged\" for something called units (you start every match with 20 of them), so for example, if you want to execute an Hyper Shoot (the most effective shoot in the game) you will have 6 units less.

While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.\n\nIncludes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing; Shooter","Developer":"Bullfrog Productions, Ltd.","Publisher":"Bullfrog Productions","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"16fe9da4-b08e-45ff-af2b-78b27a66bc6e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"ce5d2528-6baa-40ce-8ecd-a53a21862045.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"9c8d7b61-16e6-4d15-a34e-fb8cca6217d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"b619b0c3-1778-4599-8b4b-dbf3224ab6e0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"97b5aaae-c4dd-42c0-9c99-45bb9c2dff97.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"8fa06a09-ecf9-4365-b765-403966a35297.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"f1496e91-cc85-4f83-a253-c0a46d82a88c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"6d7ace87-5196-4522-aa27-115cc8842a43.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"a1292f9c-6164-4d40-81f0-51c020e937d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"f4f23934-8c95-4b15-9016-7e8200f00af7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"038368b8-5a2d-48f1-ac09-4343abff91a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"4579321a-c778-4e5a-a1d0-b94b61032d22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"f7422648-8124-46cd-bc27-7d3372f5d7cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"6cf8de23-889f-40ac-8289-54dd864e6ede.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"34911767-b2b0-49ee-9be6-043153737e93.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"6bb6dd0d-e012-4718-9ea9-80174232f3c7.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"4a72ded6-6cad-40d3-93d9-1802c951b9b9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":2422,"FileName":"4ddd70f7-c907-44dc-9ee5-a7b1b54e2b83.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":2422,"AlternateName":"Hi-Octane","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157040,"Name":"Hissatsu Pachinko Collection","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hissatsu Pachinko Collection (必殺パチンココレクション) is a set of pachinko games for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157040,"FileName":"55eb28bc-a9bc-4472-9b3e-7c6e5772f0a9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157040,"FileName":"fc0cf67b-cb4e-490a-998d-195c2bb00d73.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157040,"FileName":"17fc70a0-0875-4dba-b9a1-693e17014869.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157040,"FileName":"01a3af1c-4f6d-44a6-9832-2617533d9da0.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":140863,"Name":"Hissatsu!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Three men and a cowboy plot to assassinate tyrannical criminals in the old days of Japan.

It was the only game in the franchise released on a Sega system; Sega themselves would later license the franchise for an on-going series of arcade and console games. \n\nInitial D, a popular long running manga series, has spawned not only an equally popular anime series and a live-action movie adaptation, but several video games over the years. The series' first appearance on home consoles occurred in 1998, with the release of Initial D for PlayStation and Sega Saturn. \n\nThe series follows Takumi, an indolent teenager who, after delivering tofu for his dad's business in the early hours of the morning, finds himself to be something of an expert in the art of drifting down mountain roads. This in turn leads to him and others racing each other on a variety of Japanese mountains – perfect video game fodder. \n\nThe main guts of the game is the Story Mode which sets up a series of races via some FMV clips and static CG images. There is no voice acting in either of these which is immediately jarring and something that instantly stands out when played today. \n\nThe music deserves a mention also. Anyone who has even a basic knowledge of Initial D will know that it is defined by not only fast paced drift racing, but an equally high energy Eurobeat soundtrack. Inexplicably, this is missing entirely from the game. The music used sets the atmosphere well, but fans will notice the change and will lament what feels like a missed opportunity to add to the authenticity of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Genki","Publisher":"Kodansha","ReleaseDate":"1998-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140869,"FileName":"7794e4fc-0b72-4623-a503-ab8127c6b22e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140869,"FileName":"74991178-5470-4c38-b147-83fb7d4d6f18.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140869,"FileName":"83d16574-aa72-4492-a5dd-e183309e5a00.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140869,"FileName":"ef6d9559-9d7f-4eaf-ad28-dbd15de6aec2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140869,"FileName":"c50e9bc4-c22b-44c9-841d-4edf2896306c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140869,"FileName":"d88cfec2-9644-4c97-aed8-0c951789d4fd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":140869,"AlternateName":"Koudou Saisoku Densetsu: Initial D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140869,"AlternateName":"Initial D: Koudou Saisoku Densetsu","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":157047,"Name":"Ippatsu Gyakuten: Gambling King he no Michi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ippatsu Gyakuten: Gambling King he no Michi (一発逆転 ギャンブルキングへの道) is a gambling game for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Planning Office Wada","Publisher":"BMG Victor","ReleaseDate":"1997-07-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157047,"FileName":"3cfe72f2-5b63-4b1a-86ac-ceb4095e1380.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157047,"FileName":"34c7eefb-bf44-4b34-b108-56b043ab78b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157047,"FileName":"f69bb008-422f-40c3-9e8f-78bfe7072de1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157047,"FileName":"37e3db95-f1ca-4085-85e9-b0264447686c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157047,"AlternateName":"Ippatsu Gyakuten: Gambling King e no Michi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":140870,"Name":"Irem Arcade Classics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Irem Arcade Classics (アイレム アーケードクラシックス) is a compilation of three arcade games by Irem, released exclusively in Japan for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.\n\n- 10-Yard Fight\n- Spartan-X (Kung-Fu Master)\n- Zippy Race (Motorace USA)","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Irem","Publisher":"I'Max","ReleaseDate":"1996-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140870,"FileName":"0a8f7b12-7ff7-4cdd-8027-7fa6b349e0f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140870,"FileName":"6b42e0f2-ff9a-4ac1-a378-8531ae7165bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140870,"FileName":"52e122cb-b603-4101-b641-6a3b224cd9cb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140870,"FileName":"b639121d-45cc-4114-b531-bf173491b4e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140870,"FileName":"b79c29f4-5529-4711-b3b4-f66b3a1a29d6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7937,"Name":"Iron Man / X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game is a linear beat 'em up Final Fight type game with the choice to play as one of two comic book heroes: Iron Man or X-O Manowar.

Golf is defined, in the rules of golf, as \"playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules.\" \n\nThe Japan Golf Tour is a prominent golf tour. It was founded in 1973 and as of 2006 it offers the third highest annual prize fund out of the regular (that is not for seniors) men's professional tours after the PGA Tour and the European Tour. However since the early 1990s, the growth in prize money has not kept pace with that on the two larger tours.

It was played at the Jun Classic Country Club and the Rope Club in Tochigi prefecture .

You merely press the displayed buttons at the correct time. \n\n The graphics are made up of 3D models for the characters, and have a unique cartoon-style.  The graphics suit the style of game and are quite nice.  The music has a very quirky Japanese pop-style.  The songs are all quite catchy, and you will find yourself humming the tunes long after you have turned the game off.  The lyrics are all Japanese (with a few exceptions), but this doesn't take away from the gameplay.\n\n There are some negatives to the game.  Sometimes you will enter the button presses exactly, but still get booed.  And conversley, you will sometimes make a mistake, but still get a wow.  This doesn't happen enough to ruin the game, though.\n\n If you have a Saturn, and you want a solid music-based rhythm game, there are few choices.

Plus there's even an AI setup mode. \n\nIf you're looking for a different type of fighter other than the standard Sega fighters or Capcom / SNK 2D fighters then I recommend K1 Fighting Illusion Show.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting; Sports","Developer":"Daft","Publisher":"Xing Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140897,"FileName":"0ada5b1a-465b-4c61-b613-af24799b334d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140897,"FileName":"9b2865f3-09f2-4b2d-b407-da7175fb0d62.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140897,"FileName":"afafdfd0-bd1e-4bf7-b16d-f058370b30c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140897,"FileName":"476b1861-e428-4a42-ae27-701220b1b9df.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140897,"FileName":"a21e2a5c-bd06-47bd-8369-c312043c0a1d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":140897,"AlternateName":"K-1 Grand Prix: Fighting Illusion Shou","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140897,"AlternateName":"K-1 Fighting Illusion Shou","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":181113,"Name":"Kaitou Saint Tail","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kaitou Saint Tail is an adventure game for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Access","Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"1997-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181113,"FileName":"94f2f6a4-7fd4-4e2e-b026-1b66d55cb615.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181113,"FileName":"b0566784-e304-4ecb-96bc-4d13456afadb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181113,"FileName":"7af9ed93-f8ca-4aaa-ae42-3f3b5cf1f6db.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181113,"FileName":"9e243c57-0914-466e-892b-b1997a4a1949.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181113,"FileName":"9675f4a9-95ef-49dc-a40b-8c783be5b0ae.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181113,"FileName":"d7790986-872f-4cb3-81d5-e59369a7fb94.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175185,"Name":"Kakinoki Shougi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kakinoki Shougi (柿木将棋) is an shougi game for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"ASCII Entertainment","Publisher":"Ascii Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175185,"FileName":"41a46952-9741-4b56-aad9-1175ecea3eda.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175185,"FileName":"5b74481a-ffc6-4654-82cd-af527b34814f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175185,"FileName":"9e28d458-1a38-4851-9c78-11fb3993b949.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175185,"FileName":"31328c44-cc35-4967-9c9c-a68cdf6b2f34.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157060,"Name":"Kakyuusei","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Kakyūsei, the player takes the role of a young Japanese high-school student named Kentarou. During the summer break, Kentarou has been working in a restaurant, run by a relative of his family. Now the summer is over, so Kentarou can finally get his salary and prepare for the school season that is about to begin. With some money in his pocket, and plenty of interest towards representatives of the fairer sex, the boy is determined to make this school year memorable...\n\nThe game is a so-called love adventure, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game with a heavy emphasis on dating, similar to Dōkyūsei, another popular game of that kind by Elf. The word \"kakyūsei\" means \"student(s) from a lower grade\", which in its turn means that younger girls are the primary \"dating focus\" of the game. However, it is also possible to date other women beside the hero's schoolmates, including even a teacher.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dōkyūsei: the player navigates Kentarou through the top-down city, visiting locations that are presented as still screens viewed from first-person perspective. The game has an internal clock, and each visit advances it, so that the number of activities that can be done during one day is limited. Kentarou must usually wait for the next weekend or vacation to be able to explore the city freely.\n\nThe game offers a considerable amount of freedom in exploration, and the possibility to visit diverse locations, such as museum, cinema, parks, game arcades, etc. Kentarou can earn and pend money, buying items that can be given to a girl on a date. The dating mechanics, however, are not very complex, mostly involving being at the right place at the right time, and choosing appropriate answers to impress the girl.\n\nThe game features scenes with nudity and sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Elf Co.

The game follows a One Year War between Zion Dukedom and United Nations. The war lasts 150 turns for the player where player can either try to achieve scenario victory or complete victory over the enemy. There are two story based campaign where player can play on either side of the conflict. The battlefield uses hexagonal grid where player can produce or move units, conquer cities or attack enemy forces on ground, in the air, and even in space. The battlefield is split into two maps; a world map that lets player conquer all the continents, and space map which focuses on the battle in planet's orbit. Battles take place simultaneously and player can switch between two maps at any point during the game.\n\nUnits consist of tanks, planes, spaceships, and most importantly, mobile suits which can battle both in space and on the planet. On either side the player has access to all his generals and commanders, and just as some ace pilots, they will often comment on the situation when engaging in combat. The map doesn't feature fog-of-war, but enemy units outside the scope of your own are not visible. The game effectively removes trial-and-error style of gameplay where player may try to attack an enemy until the random battle turns in his favor by performing all battles at the end of each turn rather than at the moment of attacking the enemy. So in a way, each turn is plan of attack rather than an array of individual skirmishes. Terrain limits movement to ground forces, making tanks move faster on the roads than through forests or over mountains. Having multiple units surrounding enemy will result in additional fire support to your troops and will deal more damage to the unit that you are attacking or is attacking you.

Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed \"Krazy Ivan\". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.\n\nThe player controls Ivan's \"Steel Cossack\" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.\n\nThe Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.\n\nAfter a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.\n\nBetween the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Psygnosis","Publisher":"Psygnosis","ReleaseDate":"1997-05-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"c8e894ce-4a7c-43b2-b4e3-4c52e4714b2a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"2d1725aa-f168-4a91-bf91-fbdbfdbb48d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"9ebb0670-e10a-48f8-86fd-d0e5dd37e0bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"7abaf69b-aa1e-46e2-9ffe-6eb2211c66bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"1006b76b-edd1-4436-9600-ca01b01a9c33.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"1e38fd3a-7c91-45ab-b8e2-7e8dd58ae5cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"1f93fbc4-1256-4d01-b723-0e43555c99d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"692c04d2-b73f-4bb3-89d9-4d92886c36aa.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11286,"FileName":"33502ecd-fa4c-47bc-958e-bbbbfd1bf048.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175213,"Name":"Kumitate Battle Kuttu Ketto","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kumitate Battle: Kuttu Ketto is a Strategy game, developed and published by TechnoSoft, which was released in Japan in 1998.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1998-04-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175213,"FileName":"d5504880-e527-402f-bcb1-ef4e944f330d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175213,"FileName":"2906a444-a0d2-40fc-8a0e-e176e91f9de7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175213,"FileName":"aecbc597-8611-4bf1-8415-f50341919ffb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175213,"FileName":"11706538-578c-4fd1-a1f0-f64744067176.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157088,"Name":"Kunoichi Torimonochou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long ago, during the Edo period, those chosen to become ninja train in secrecy from youth, living in an isolated village to become a secret agent for the shogun.

Panic Bomber was unfortunately and inexplicably never ported to the Saturn so this is probably the closest concept you'll get to it.\n\nBasically, to get rid of blocks on your level, you have to connect as many of the bomb fuses that drop together as possible, to form links. Then blow them up with bombs that fall. Problem is, you can't just use the bombs that drop, you then have to wait for the fire balls to drop for the bombs to explode. If your opponent is quicker than you, you'll end up with what look like snowmen's heads dropping all over your side of the screen causing you all sorts of issues.\n\nThis is what I mean when I say that most of the decent split screen puzzle games play completely different to the rest. People just manage to come up with original ideas and place them over an unoriginal format. This is certainly not the best two player puzzler on the Saturn but if you can perhaps get it cheap enough it's really good fun with two humans. The one player game on this I find less enjoyable because it's far more complicated than others and it's great to see which of your real life friends has more wits about them than you.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sky Think Systems","Publisher":"Sky Think Systems","ReleaseDate":"1996-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140903,"FileName":"11af1088-af8a-4aff-a2c8-9836fff7a743.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140903,"FileName":"e3bc3a5f-26e3-429b-a9ec-d78bc153930a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140903,"FileName":"92181bfe-ed96-456e-af84-b93131734d69.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140903,"FileName":"94e52f71-9869-48c2-805d-b8112ff5a3fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140903,"FileName":"e874c68a-77da-4e77-ac96-1bc45994536f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157089,"Name":"Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game is based on the anime Gulliver Boy, created by Teruhisa Hiroi.

Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Career Soft","Publisher":"Masaya","ReleaseDate":"1998-06-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146548,"FileName":"4ec1853a-72b5-4b2f-ba0c-d46f4cf667a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146548,"FileName":"9b4997d3-4faa-4ba5-8d2d-f2fb7233d0f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146548,"FileName":"49844ffb-1231-4ade-bdfe-a3df7657f9eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146548,"FileName":"3593e542-121c-42ad-884b-92ed181f3309.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146548,"FileName":"73bbd9f5-4435-4682-ae86-6c6456bf49d1.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146548,"FileName":"117f06be-f082-435c-a25d-16dbf80c7062.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11287,"Name":"Last Bronx","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The leader of Soul Crew, the toughest gang in Tokyo, was viciously killed.

It was later ported by Alfa System to the Playstation and then to the Saturn, both of which featured updated graphics and anime cutscenes. The Saturn version includes content that was censored in the Playstation version of the game due to explicit violence and gore. The Saturn version also featured a 24-track soundtrack CD with three karaoke tracks.\n\nLinda is a really weird game. It’s the juxtaposition of cuteness and gore that’s so bizarre… and cool!\n\nThe game is set in Neo Kenya, a doomed world waiting on an inbound impact from an asteroid called Grim Reaper. The occupants of the world begin evacuating but WON’T SOMEONE THINK OF THE ANIMALS?\n\nwon't someone think of the animals?\nOut of nowhere, a mysterious Ark appears vaguely resembling the one in the Christian bible. On that ark is a monolith giving the instructions to gather two of every animal. You play the game as Ken, who finds himself and his girlfriend Linda chosen as the two to spearhead the project and pilot the ark to it’s destination.\n\nLinda³ lives up to it’s exponential title by offering three different scenarios to play, all in different timelines where various things are different for Ken and Linda. The first two scenarios offer a serious story, while the third is downright parody of the game’s setting and plots in the other scenarios.\n\nThe first scenario finds Linda kidnapped and rendered amnesiac by his apparent evil twin, who is dressed in… a Santa outfit? Yeah, a Santa outfit.\n\nLinda³ santa clone\nThe second scenario, Ken and Linda are attacked on their wedding night and Linda loses her left arm. It’s okay, though, because she gets a replacement arm… by Doctor Hitler!\n\nLinda³ hitler doctor\nThe third scenario finds Ken waking up from a coma (induced by a banana!) to find out he and Linda are already married.\n\nThe Saturn version of the game has an additional fourth scenario! It’s a time attack mode that’s hard as balls to complete unless you know the game well.\n\nThe gameplay in Linda³ primarily centers on fighting animals until they are weak and capturing them. You have eight game years (or 32 seasons) to complete your goal of gathering all of the animals required to finish the game.\n\nKen and Linda can be assisted by animals once they’re captured. Gameplay is pretty standard, menu-driven JRPG fare otherwise, complete with cuter than Dragon Quest sprites for most of the animals.\n\nMale animals can be used to make weapons, female animals can be used to craft armor. The stats of both depends on the animal used to create them. In addition to becoming leather fodder, animals can also be used to feed and heal the main characters.\n\nLinda³ artwork\nAs you collect animals and register them in the ark, you gain stat bonuses, new abilities and beast forms for Ken and Linda. The beast forms can be chosen in battle to give specific statistical or terrain bonuses.\n\nShops in town offer quite a wide range. How many RPGs have black markets, furniture stores, a banking system, an incubator service, a vivisectionist, trappers, bounty hunters, cage matches, dog fighting, and a veterinary service? Insane.\n\nSeasons progress, giving you access to different animals and food to encounter. As time marches on, the populace of the world packs up and moves out. You ultimately end up exploring a mostly empty world if you allow enough time to pass. Entire towns can become abandoned. You really get a sense of a world being evacuated, which is fantastic.\n\nShould you fail to complete your task in time, Ken and Linda will be left on the planet to die.\n\nIf the artwork above or below looks familiar, it might be because the game’s character designer was Tatsuyuki Tanaka. He’s been involved with loads of classic anime movies and series like Akira, Bubblegum Crisis, and Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. He’s got that classic 80s anime style.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Alfa System","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseDate":"1998-06-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"1bb365f7-7690-4a02-a3a6-165e0d107473.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"2a3a58a3-6e48-4e0c-b06b-25d63abfc335.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"1946f287-8a8a-4e23-8802-394d30781190.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"ece78786-bff6-4926-9870-3216766466cd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"189a88d0-e3ac-4119-a23c-4875ebd2c299.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"442febea-7e5a-4fe6-99e1-cc25c3894b50.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"19863abe-652b-4349-b8a9-10b1830cfb47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"7252c66f-50d2-44a4-94dd-224436a73c9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"8d98c806-3d1f-4ce7-a63c-4a4ce843ee35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164366,"FileName":"0de5fbe3-dbee-46d6-b937-a66a74c37405.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164366,"AlternateName":"linda 3 - kanzenban","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"AlternateName":"リンダキューブ 完全版","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"AlternateName":"Linda Cube: Perfect Edition","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164366,"AlternateName":"Linda^3 Kanzenban","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":132352,"Name":"Linkle Liver Story","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Linkle Liver Story is an action-oriented RPG that takes place on a distant planet called Mamuuna whose inhabitants are humans with animal qualities.

The protagonist Alex's side-kick Nall has now an active role in the battles: he would revive fallen characters, restoring them to 1 HP.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Game Arts","Publisher":"Kadokawa Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164627,"FileName":"ceb40062-a9ea-425e-a564-b73df2ec4646.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164627,"FileName":"6bbf8592-029c-49e3-ad10-eb1b3cb8bbc6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164627,"FileName":"ca9c4a8a-1692-42a1-89e8-ff4d5d86a34f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164627,"FileName":"db661d7c-538a-44d2-92e3-0c0439eab712.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164627,"FileName":"b31aab11-0aab-446d-b56c-13cf2168d739.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164627,"FileName":"0a726642-3142-403b-94f3-0a7ec3425d0d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157092,"Name":"Lupin the 3rd: Chronicles","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lupin the 3rd: Chronicles (ルパン三世 クロニクル) is a multimedia disc for the Sega Saturn, based upon the 1970s and 1980s Lupin the 3rd anime series and movies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Spike","Publisher":"Spike","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"c9d20e9e-bc62-45ab-9c13-fec7553749e4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"6eb2e608-ccab-4111-b552-7c3f7a32dcc7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"7cf458e6-67bc-4f21-ac7a-51af195c380a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"b2ec2df9-b796-4bbd-ad20-a6230ee6ec2c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"45dfe377-cd18-46bf-baab-8fd5a7395198.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"4b5e52fe-fed7-49cf-a567-db7c16e7162f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"913a20f4-8201-4e94-984e-ef238fee1ab4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"97503ce8-f9df-43c5-b4d0-900d7d7d1bed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157092,"FileName":"68056fae-0d55-4eda-8224-d700820dc0d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":140982,"Name":"Lupin the 3rd: Pyramid no Kenja","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lupin, while attempting to elude Zenigata in a desert region, stumbles upon a pyramid and decides to seek refuge inside.

You control the characters by making decisions for them: where to go next, how to answer to another character, etc. In many cases, there are wrong decisions which lead to a premature end (bad ending). The story is presented through text (without voices) and still shots of live actors and locations, with occasional short animated sequences.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I0yJdjBR5Q","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Chunsoft","Publisher":"Chunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1998-01-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30074,"FileName":"85aa3e45-2e22-4342-a7ab-0d510fe23284.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30074,"FileName":"05ab535b-333f-43ae-852e-47c6b1a87caa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30074,"FileName":"a9a0b536-6da8-4230-b593-1c968dec08a7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30074,"FileName":"fa68c356-67f6-4427-9116-89921c102ca4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30074,"FileName":"05d29b24-0b0a-477a-8dac-3490008bf469.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30074,"FileName":"5e32e2bb-bf1d-4149-927a-dfb45af6ebef.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":30074,"AlternateName":"Sound Novel Machi","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":31375,"Name":"Machine Head","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"THE WORLD IS INFECTED WITH A DEADLY, MAN-MADE VIRUS.

Added to these are the new Custom Season and Fantasy Draft. Custom Season allows players to customize the NFL divisions and thus the schedule with all available teams, including the classic teams. Fantasy Draft is a custom tournament mode for four or eight teams. Players create their own teams by giving them names and then drafting players. The tournament consists of a round-robin round followed by semi-finals and finals. The option of creating and trading players also returns, and can be made more realistic by employing salary caps and trading deadlines within a season.\n\nDuring a game, the same graphics style employed by the previous year's game is used: polygonally-rendered 3D stadiums with players, ball and referees as 2D bitmaps.

Besides storing mana, the player's castle also serves as a sancturary for them where they cannot be killed and can regain health and mana.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"Krisalis Software","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"538108ee-20c3-4225-acde-98a3f1b3a643.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"9af5343a-e7af-45d2-813a-379dad817c70.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"c56136c5-76dc-489c-b5b1-5a6281f2fbf5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"544ec25f-d25c-4c70-9095-249c0a23e46d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"d625d4da-aa89-40a7-a8aa-fe41a27251db.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"a52432ab-13de-407e-8323-8a4901e74927.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"e017bef2-fa8f-43db-8b0b-4174eaedf7de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"95075b73-5a7e-4159-8b91-e050cf7d69a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"61d503c8-820f-4d3f-8aef-9a5273458d67.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"2388c9da-c467-47f1-80a8-03b801e31c9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"ea96bfca-5d4a-4d5d-99ea-9e96663b2d96.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11294,"FileName":"090d8fc7-5eaf-47d6-9e83-34ace0b7e797.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11295,"Name":"Magic Knight Rayearth","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"As a dimension built on the power of dreams crumbles toward extinction, three innocent girls are plucked from the top of Tokyo Tower and transported to the fantastic world of Cefiro, where they must become the warriors of myth and prophecy.

One day a new patient is brought into the hospital you work in - Maria, a young woman who has attempted suicide. She suffers from amnesia, and you try to find out more about her, visiting her and talking to her. Before long you discover that Maria has schizophrenia - a split personality. Her \"other self\" appears to be evil and threatens to take over her.

While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":"Quantum Factory","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1997-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"40244a65-8302-4c79-a90b-3e5502a3b55a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"911760db-4655-410c-b406-c854a99c2e13.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"790a4512-110c-45ff-bf32-3f9bfe837cd0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"ba146934-bfb0-4170-9da2-6e7398ad70e7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"ef19e2ff-4bb2-45fa-b921-43842fcd3e49.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"08502a8f-e321-4739-85ba-bc735c557e46.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"6d7cdf79-a843-413e-982e-cb429d6b9ea3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"48deca27-6da6-4fa2-b36b-5601e23b6e70.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"2966b536-5f38-46f0-8d72-38e3b88606b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"65a0f90a-4a11-4cf4-a0a6-79f019dfa21e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"f9e6f3bf-f5eb-43d5-a33a-19f7b197aca5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"2acb001d-3d07-45df-8848-57cdbf844083.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"b3625615-1244-420e-b582-934aa8fab370.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"FileName":"dd763bf1-1060-4573-a548-54af606c3d5c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9259,"AlternateName":"MechWarrior 2 - 31st Century Combat","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":9259,"AlternateName":"MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat: Arcade Combat Edition","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":182878,"Name":"Media ROMancer Daisuke Asakura","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"1996-01-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182878,"FileName":"f7e13a06-75bb-423a-af4b-73b92843c999.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182878,"FileName":"7a588aca-96b0-49ac-9b61-0148401f5f86.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182878,"FileName":"f988420c-c053-43e1-b69c-5d572ce9d52b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182878,"FileName":"9be0e220-ea5a-4866-a6ba-4ac8e8731e8d.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182878,"AlternateName":"MediaROMancer: DA: Daisuke Asakura","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":6281,"Name":"Mega Man 8: Anniversary Collector's Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mega Man 8: Anniversary Edition (more known as Mega Man 8, known in Japan as Rockman 8: Metal Heroes) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation on January 1997.\n\nIt is the eighth installment of the original Mega Man series (and the sequel to Mega Man 7). The only official installment of the series for 32-bit consoles, Mega Man 8 introduces a brand new art style (the second complete change in the series) and cutscenes detailed in animated full-motion video. The game commemorates the 10th anniversary of the series and is the last titled game in the franchise for 11 years (before Mega Man 9).\n\nSet in the year 20XX, the game takes place shortly after the events of Mega Man 7 (in which the humanoid robot hero Mega Man defeats both the evil roboticist Dr. Wily, for the seventh time, and new-found rival Bass). Two mysterious forces battle in outer space before crash-landing down to Earth, causing Mega Man (who was battling Bass at the time) to investigate. When he reaches the crater, he sees Dr. Wily (flying away with a mysterious purple orb) and a mysterious damaged robot to send back to Dr. Light for repair. When Dr. Wily sends a new group of Robot Masters to combat Mega Man, our hero must battle Dr. Wily's forces while investigating the connection between the purple orbs and the damaged robot.\n\nBecause the PlayStation version was rushed to be released a month before the Sega Saturn version, the Sega Saturn version received some bonus additions, most notably access to special material (such as official artwork and sound test mode) and two new mini-boss battles (Cut Man from the original Mega Man and Wood Man from Mega Man 2).\n\nThe PlayStation version of the game was later released (in North America only) as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube on June 23, 2004 and the Xbox on March 15, 2005. An unofficial 8-bit \"demake\" of Mega Man 8 was finished in 2010, coinciding with the release of the deliberately-retro Mega Man 10. More information can be found here.\n\nShortly after the game was released, Capcom began porting the game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with the intent of selling it to those who have not purchased one of the two 32-bit consoles. Not wanting to make a half-hearted attempt, they ended up making an original Mega Man game (exclusively for Japan in its original run) using most of the assets from Mega Man 8 (including two of the game's bosses, Tengu Man and Astro Man), titled Rockman & Forte.\n\n-Gameplay\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous games, but with some additions. The main priority is the player picks a level and fights the end boss; Mega Man will earn a weapon for defeating the boss. Rush also returns with some special abilities. Also returning from Mega Man 7 is the item store.\n\nLike Mega Man 7, only four robot masters are available at the start. After the player beats the first four, the other four will appear. The weapons earned from the first four robot masters play a big role in the other four levels; for example, in Search Man's stage, the thunder claw that was earned from Clown Man, is used to get through spiked gaps by using the thunder claw to grab on to metal poles and swing to the other side.\n\nRush returns in Mega Man 8, this time with new abilities. Old abilities like Rush Marine and Rush Coil have been retired, but new abilities are introduced. Each new ability can be earned by defeating the mid bosses in some of the game's levels. The first new ability is Rush can transform into a motorcycle - Mega Man can hop on, shoot projectiles, and run at high speed. The other is Rush will drop a random item for Mega Man, which can be a health item or ammunition for Mega Man's weapon. Rush can also fly up in the air and drop health or ammunition items for Mega Man. The last new ability is Rush can fly up in the air and aid Mega Man in battle by dropping missiles on enemies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_vEnrvJsWY","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"ff011f55-1434-486d-8ce8-42fad99950aa.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"0fbf3f1b-a4d0-4fed-8676-c1f90617715d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"0076dc4d-c8ef-47e5-990a-142c6ee993a7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"86decf97-b136-473f-be29-643d63a1fa1f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"9dc16408-1d87-413c-afb2-b0f471750162.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"27914c29-5777-4c2e-a056-9821a86a4f0e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"15865bd0-7956-46f2-9aff-6be0a3830023.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"c7647f50-cb96-433f-8fd7-43c938740a07.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"3cf29046-0e80-48e9-b0d2-ca48a964b078.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"617e8446-140c-48bb-b859-c336c8012894.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"5ec01fe1-7b70-4705-ae14-11030e544bde.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"57ebb56f-08e8-4e15-a488-e407bef1c82a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"2ce2fc98-d7d7-4d5b-b725-6fa68eb37235.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"6ca9f3e8-d7fd-49f7-ab6c-5f5a1ad4232d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"6d7e772f-0000-4f6d-8482-b4ec3e768095.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"72ee7456-b59f-493f-9589-9476559f35ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"FileName":"3de95238-8e11-46c1-9450-5431c1314c07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":6281,"AlternateName":"Rockman 8: Metal Heroes","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6281,"AlternateName":"Mega Man 8","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":9206,"Name":"Mega Man X3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler begins creation of a new city for Reploids, which will bring a new era of peace to the Reploids and humans.

It is the fourth game in the Mega Man X series and the second game in the series to be released on the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. The two versions were released simultaneously in Japan on August 1, 1997. A North America release followed sometime thereafter, while Europe received only the PlayStation version on October 13, 1997.\n\nTaking place in the 22nd century, the Mega Man X series is set in a society populated by humans and intelligent robots called \"Reploids\". A military taskforce called the \"Maverick Hunters\" is implemented to suppress the uprising of \"Mavericks\", Reploids that begin to exhibit dangerous and destructive behavior. Mega Man X4 follows two such hunters, Mega Man X and Zero, as they become involved in a conflict between the Hunters and a Reploid army called the \"Repliforce\". Mega Man X4 is an action-platform game in the same vein as other installments in the series. The player completes a set of eight stages in any order while fighting enemies, gaining power-ups, and winning the special weapon of each stage's boss. Unlike previous games in the series, Mega Man X4 allows the player to choose between the two protagonists at the beginning of the game: X, who uses traditional, long-range attacks; or Zero, who wields a short-range sword.\n\nCritical reception for Mega Man X4 has been generally positive. Critics praised the ability to play as either X or Zero, a concept many found to expand upon the then perceived exhausted gameplay formula of the Mega Man X sub-franchise during the 1990s. In addition to its console versions, the game was released on Windows worldwide in 1998 and 1999 and on Japanese mobile phones in 2011 and 2012. It was also included on the Mega Man X Collection, a compilation released in North America on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in 2006. Mega Man X4 was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line on September 2, 2014 in North America and December 17, 2014 in Japan.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E -

You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.\n\nMyst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.\n\nThe game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cyan","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"47f88a8a-e265-454f-9b47-b3a015688e53.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"b7f1f6f9-cb1e-4001-a013-f61fd1e35482.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"5920572e-d772-4862-8a2c-5bc5742cedb4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"4895b6b6-fef3-4ecc-83e5-3a4225cea59c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"a96bb080-ef18-4d0d-95ce-0959b4e669ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"57249c39-07cc-46ec-9911-d13059223484.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"ad43418d-71bc-4608-a398-068a7afeb783.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"2d9bd395-8143-4315-9bdd-f61213498781.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"b1a0baa5-1279-4550-886c-a94e18e2bfc3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"e373640e-0a79-454b-861b-123ac191daa9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"09d98eb1-1430-4795-a3dd-845ba784b092.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"7fef3ffc-4b23-4493-89b0-d92b71052cd7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"19db63b5-1a2b-4404-b995-fefb7fd79764.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"7f460fa6-6b85-4898-b8aa-1091d554bced.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"959d30e3-07ad-4c67-8385-d20b687ff434.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11303,"FileName":"e5325be5-91e0-4b1b-b8a3-e267ab62f5c3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141000,"Name":"Nanatsu Kaze no Shima Monogatari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Nanatsu Kaze no Shima Monogatari, roughly translated by the developer as “The Seven Blasts of Wind in Island Story” (but better translated as “The Tale of Seven Winds Island”), is a commonly neglected masterpiece released by Enix exclusively for the Saturn in 1997: one that didn’t obtain the same accolades as other RPG and Adventure titles released for this system.

By default, the camera always faces forward, so Jajamaru automatically strafes when moving left and right, which makes it a lot easier to control than most 3D games. The view automatically rotates at 90 degree angles whenever you hit a turn in a hallway, although you can also adjust the camera with the trigger buttons. Like the old games, Jajamaru's main weapons are his shuriken, although he can also find a number of spells to attack all of the enemies on the screen and such. There are boss encounters every few levels, which are a bit harder to deal with - the camera tries to stay focused on the enemy, so you're constantly circle strafing them. Unfortunately, it tends to get lost or hung up, which makes dodging their fire pretty annoying. The platforming aspects are awkward when they show up, but they're relatively rare. \n\nIt's a pretty simple and straightforward game, and surprisingly avoids most of the control faults associated with early 3D action games. However, it's not particularly pretty, and its simplicity also means that it's quite easy. There aren't many levels, so it can be quickly conquered without much time or effort. It's a bit hard to find for either platform, and while it's agreeable, it's not compelling enough to justify searching for. Although the PlayStation and Saturn versions may look identical on the surface - they have the same cover, and the same cutscenes - the level layouts are different in each version. Also, the Saturn version is technically an updated version, as it was released later, denoted by the \"kin\" after the name, meaning \"gold\". It has a map screen, where little old school sprites of Jajamaru, Princess Sakura, and the Catfish pirate show up. Every few stages, you'll also get to play a level of the original Ninja Jajamaru-kun game, just to remind you of its heritage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Game Studio","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141001,"FileName":"9e02b469-84fe-4af3-8fe1-e78d784fb32a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141001,"FileName":"aa9c94c1-48c6-4b69-bfbf-32588f7c0543.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141001,"FileName":"4aaa39c2-4865-4f61-9c3f-2113b184d3ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141001,"FileName":"218bade9-31b2-4bca-a827-03073733e267.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141001,"FileName":"d267cb2b-39cc-44bc-aa3c-aeae1b1dd077.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141002,"Name":"Ninku: Tsuyokina Yatsura no Daigekitotsu!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ninku Tsuyokina Yatsura No Daigekitotsu! it´s a bit of an oddball fighting game, the animation itself is a bit choppy, but the artwork itself is amazing and somewhat original to the fighting genre. the scenarios are in 3d and the fighers 2d, bet the original idea was to crwate the feeling of a 3d environment but the fighters still play just like a regular one plane game.

It takes the overhead gameplay style of Bomberman and mixes it with standard puzzle style gameplay. Your goal is to cover your opponents playfield with bombs. \n\nBombs are made by connecting a row of three or more balls and attacking them, causing them to “explode” and reappear as bombs on your opponents playfield. This is called a NOON. There are five different colors: Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Multi/Rainbow. When lining up the balls, they must all be the same color. The lone exception being the multi color, or rainbow balls which you can mix with any one of the other colors. Rainbow balls are key to Rainbow NOONs. These are like regular NOONs only when the Rainbow Ball or balls explode it will make adjacent balls explode as well, regardless of color. \n\nOnce you fill your opponents playfield with bombs a counter will begin to countdown from 10. Upon zero you will be victorious. If your opponent manages to clear a majority of the bombs from his playfield the counter will stop. If you fill his playfield again the counter will resume again from where it left off. Clearing the playfield of bombs requires you to either push them off manually or destroying them. To destroy them you simply have to push them either against a wall or another bomb/ball until it squishes. You can also squish normal balls. This can come in handy if balls of the wrong color are blocking a potential NOON or when you want to ruin an opponent's potential NOON. Another positive aspect of squishing balls is that it refills your special attack meter. Each character has their own special attack that ranges from filling your opponents playfield with bombs to lining up a row of same colored balls for a devastating NOON.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Microcabin","Publisher":"Microcabin","ReleaseDate":"1998-01-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141004,"FileName":"131d6935-2b6d-4de2-8088-22f4cc38d296.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141004,"FileName":"cadb4b8c-7005-4f67-b77f-8d7e242c338f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141004,"FileName":"d788126f-2629-40fa-888c-3ac7d7c7e7ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141004,"FileName":"16e626e5-6041-47f5-b6c7-dfaedeeeafcf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141004,"FileName":"6736f477-96a4-49f5-afe8-dcfca7960e0d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":9202,"Name":"Norse by Norsewest: The Return of the Lost Vikings","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Lost Vikings 2 is a puzzle platform video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment and published by Interplay The sequel to The Lost Vikings, it features the original three characters plus two new playable characters, Fang the wolf and Scorch the dragon.

The three friends must now travel to a place called \"Wishing Engine\", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.\n\nThe characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.\n\nUnlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement.

One is where you and your opponent can go all out crazy and keep launching blocks OR you can make it more like Chess where there are turns. This is probably the coolest feature of the game.

There are times when it tilts less or more, depending on the enemy you’re facing. \nEverything is rendered with polygons in a 3D environment, from popcorn enemies to bosses to backgrounds. It’s evident that Planet Joker carries an epic feel that’s  ultimately unmatched by the game itself, with a general design that evokes old anime series such as Gloizer X. \n\nAfter choosing one out of seven huge available robots, the player must go through seven stages of rather repetitive action. The mecha characters differ in power, speed, defense and “charge”, which is certainly related to how fast the shield function recharges after being used. This shield makes the player invincible while active, and can only be used again after the shield bar has been fully recharged. \n\nAnother special attack is the bomb (C for a radius detonation and W for a straight wave attack), whose stock is replenished by appropriate incoming icons. The regular shot can be changed according to a power-up that comes down staggering and cycling colors (blue, green and yellow).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"IMP","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141010,"FileName":"16c6e5b3-3835-4cb6-964b-704d6a92668d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141010,"FileName":"acdbbae3-aa46-4149-944f-d77d880e9583.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141010,"FileName":"5578d62f-b8ae-4ce7-8bbf-b281b0da78da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141010,"FileName":"f343ee27-da27-40a4-9902-1bccf5aceb72.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141010,"FileName":"8437a89b-a877-4351-853b-f29a1baa8993.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128091,"Name":"Playboy Karaoke Collection Volume 1","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Playboy Karaoke Collection Volume 1 (プレイボーイカラオケVol.1) is a 1996 compilation of karaoke music videos with Playboy models in the background released by VIC Tokai for the Sega Saturn exclusively in Japan.

Three years later the founders of the colony felt it needed to be protected, and chose five best policemen from Earth to do that: Gates Becker from Scotland Yard, the Japanese Sadaoki Tokugawa, Salvatore Toscanini from New York, and two policemen from Los Angeles: Jonathan Ingram and his best friend Ed Brown. During a routine patrol on Beyond Coast, something happened to Jonathan's space suit. He was sucked into space and presumed dead. Twenty-five years later, he is miraculously discovered in his life pod, alive. He still looks like a young man, but in reality he is fifty-five years old.\n\nTrying to forget his past, Jonathan opens an investigation agency on Earth. One day, his ex-wife unexpectedly pays him a visit. She has re-married during Jonathan's prolonged absence, and asks him to find her missing husband. When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast.\n\nPolicenauts is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics.\n\nAction sequences are similar to those of Snatcher, but are more numerous and varied. The player must rapidly shoot enemies moving within a one-screen area viewed from a first-person perspective, reloading the gun manually and trying to eliminate the enemy before Jonathan's health bar is depleted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1996-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"c51675be-4dfe-4215-afa8-c32e4e4a9766.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"9c2d3ad7-930d-493c-81cc-8f05fe248edd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"214697ad-b679-48a5-ab22-4ae73423e0b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"27144189-f6df-4e59-82a2-2564e60656c6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"5b55c253-419b-4dc1-8b5b-3c6ad2014886.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"5f590379-2b42-40b2-a116-881e9b0e024c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"2c761082-be8c-43bd-9813-94292ac7486f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"6356ca5d-5b51-46dc-a91b-ab953cb01d41.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"2c6fb99f-a10a-419e-9de5-1647077ef7bb.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"f87b1b15-0d97-4ddb-8b11-2a3e7c481b13.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"6714c309-22b9-4417-9218-1a27b641f7af.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"4fb827cc-cb24-420f-862a-d02d9bdcdcb0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"8ec5960e-8479-477b-bb58-11f29214e175.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"9e17fc5c-4276-47c8-8550-6d14de6ec493.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"eb4164c6-25d8-407b-89c5-3261507c4fc4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"2f151de1-6ecf-4831-adf7-6e6ee138d61d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"a005eca2-b871-4eea-9686-d6368349e5ce.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"02498cad-bba7-43d6-966a-d30478d942c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23765,"FileName":"3b0dd917-2a86-4770-af9a-f03886d3f94b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11317,"Name":"Powerslave","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An ancient evil force, neither of this time nor of this world, has remained buried since the Egyptians walked the earth.

Although the princess develops like a RPG protagonist, she can also use various physical moves in combat: kick, dash, defend, crouch, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Atlus Co., Ltd., Racdym","Publisher":"Atlus Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"1d71856b-1811-441f-b9c8-dcecb900a14e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"6b67b09d-9382-4bd4-91c5-dfac58c81491.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"1580c17e-da14-4c96-85e1-ea3d0700b449.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"b3a21b47-03a7-4639-8de7-262e2a6e60c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"40a38ade-a6cf-4eb0-9992-02bff2528235.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"62fce8ac-de7b-4b28-8e83-58c285c735c8.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23754,"FileName":"03aa6c5c-4f86-4b03-af14-b1810d007056.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31522,"Name":"Princess Maker 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods.

For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.\n\nIt is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.\n\nMini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.\n\nThe game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31522,"FileName":"2191aead-c43b-43aa-bf97-3f7226190bb5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31522,"FileName":"b4ea145e-5a31-488d-bb24-e2b37d9018ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31522,"FileName":"5eb74678-4b6d-4726-a2bf-7a7cbdbcdd12.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31522,"FileName":"96e26057-73a7-4a54-8384-9f5f5c80463e.Png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157134,"Name":"Princess Maker: Yumemiru Yousei","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The fourth in Gainax' Princess Maker simulation series.

As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (三?) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135869,"FileName":"6421745b-ad6d-4847-a5b7-55d56144a3ab.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135869,"FileName":"6031662b-14f0-4ee5-9199-2c3f9240ec00.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135869,"FileName":"f3a2a54d-3f4d-46b2-94d5-e96ffa63b146.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135869,"FileName":"1ce052eb-3b47-45bd-87c1-4783369f3598.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135869,"FileName":"973571f5-fdea-4ded-86e4-69ff956500bd.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":135869,"AlternateName":"Puyo Puyo Sun for SegaNet","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":182913,"Name":"Puyo Puyo Sun for SegaNet","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"1997-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182913,"FileName":"cca9bd63-eda3-4d64-87ca-af875902e9ed.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182913,"FileName":"a9c81183-1d68-4d13-95de-007f4530bfae.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182913,"FileName":"1a15d05a-046e-40d0-b9fe-6a308567b71f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182913,"FileName":"f9689532-861b-4aea-864c-0587dcf3143a.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182914,"Name":"Puzzle Bobble 3 for SegaNet ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"1997-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182914,"FileName":"3498b177-feac-43e4-988c-1e9c06b176a6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182914,"FileName":"c5aca518-1ccc-4707-be10-85dd45ff7265.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182914,"FileName":"1bbe1b0e-1eb6-42b2-8215-9eee727dc9ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182914,"FileName":"ac80d2ec-44c7-481d-bda7-5d007d575be6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175504,"Name":"Pyon Pyon Kyaruru no Mahjong Hiyori","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pyon Pyon Kyaruru no Mahjong Hiyori (ぴょんぴょんキャルルのまあじゃん日和) is a 1996 mahjong game for the Sega Saturn by Natsume with cute anime-style characters.

The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.\n\nid Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, Quake is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.\n\nIn single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.\n\nUnlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.\n\nThe enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.\n\nQuake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"id Software","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"d4242b22-e0df-4b25-bc86-768c7382212d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"bd34fcc3-3615-4ee4-b4ce-d721750c2d9d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"ef2e66cd-4e91-4bb0-b8de-8aa6df89aa3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"150aeed3-421a-4718-8716-cc5483e74280.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"ffdf9493-e6d9-4c89-809e-46162fcfdac3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"e49d1530-6828-4b32-a30e-91e33ce7696d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"d5b9b391-d3f8-47d7-9c2e-f5f1533a5487.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"7c87fd32-4043-4456-b616-b4fe61b7ec2c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"dd636a33-3e2b-4827-9bbe-f65ef3363b70.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11319,"FileName":"6b62df7f-cfc6-4613-86ed-99f3e7b11263.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157141,"Name":"Quantum Gate I: Akumu no Joshou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Quantum Gate is an adventure game set on a distant planet, in which you are sent out to fight in a war with an alien race.

The game features Edogawa Rampo, a Japanese mystery novel writer, as a protagonist and is based on the movie with the same name which was released a year earlier. In real life, Edogawa Rampo (江戸川 乱歩) is a pseudonym of Hirai Tarou (平井 太郎), a Japanese novelist who wrote mystery fiction in the early-to-middle of 20th century.\n\nHaving a writer's block and still under influence that your work has been banned from publishing due to the level of disturbance portrayed, with your editor, Yokomizo Seishi, pressing you to write your next piece, you just can't wrap around your head to make it happen. So you get up from your writing desk and head to do the landlord business and pick up the rent from the occupants. The place is man-exclusive, there is no women allowed, yet you secretly find out someone has been bringing a woman and not just to talk to. What may have started as debauchery will soon turn your life around when it reveals a much bigger mystery than you bargained for.\n\nThe game is played in 1st-person perspective where you can turn left or right, or move forward and backward. Moving forward in closed locations will often end up in zooming certain objects and occasionally pick them up if they are of any importance. Picked up objects can be viewed in your inventory and used in certain locations or during dialogues. Movie is not free 3D movement, but instead uses pre-rendered cutscenes for every movement animation. Characters will often cycle through their dialogues unless there is a time where you can inquire about some item from your inventory. Yokomizo Seishi, your editor, will accompany you and will often provide comments when you won't be able to go to certain areas or if you try to do weird things (i.e. try to go outside without a reason, or try to unlock someone else's room without a proper cause). Occasionally your protagonist will also speak, at which moment the picture will be frozen (there is no idle movements of characters or animate objects in the areas when you're talking or just standing still).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"System Sacom","Publisher":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157150,"FileName":"8369bbdf-3a88-4192-84c4-31c0ee147e7e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157150,"FileName":"4562edf1-2064-4b31-a319-d207e8078ba4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157150,"FileName":"6f903e63-baa1-4422-81bc-b18b11332439.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157150,"FileName":"110396e6-751a-4ac2-a94d-47b61d607327.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157150,"FileName":"418fc659-6d70-4e88-8b63-8910d68f6ea6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157150,"FileName":"c97db287-191f-4535-9733-f9452d5ee2e1.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7834,"Name":"Rayman","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs.

Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.\n\nOnce you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of \"boss\" robot is put in your way. These \"bosses\" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!\n\nThe arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Altron Corporation","Publisher":"Kokopeli","ReleaseDate":"1996-02-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"33290f06-5f87-4db2-ac8e-bdbe3bea3b27.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"1e81449f-dee4-4f1d-99da-f87041bb049a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"ae6f8b43-c881-48fd-b146-6afdfe80a91b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"13ea0821-766a-4291-822c-be76cc937e9a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"318fbb15-453d-4af6-8ff4-2d919b72d339.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"09d33845-64dc-43ea-8570-5afe8783598d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"28814956-9b78-4c0d-885a-06abf66501a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"69718cf1-a5fb-47e9-a3c5-546b4b4caa06.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"043c996c-99be-4e49-aabc-c64e9dd31ec2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"c43f0506-4140-437a-a338-7adfb9adbcb8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"7e058e89-13cb-4840-935f-eb465e8b1824.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"602c33c1-15af-46ed-b5ba-c71f0bcf71a2.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"19222f8e-9737-416f-9c2b-1b96ce0db7c6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11324,"FileName":"7a61aa3b-14de-4fe8-87ba-c9329e5c32e9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11325,"Name":"Robotica","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Robotica, also known as Robotica Cybernation Revolt in Europe and Deadalus (ダイダロス?) in Japan, is a first-person shooter which was released for the Sega Saturn in 1995.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXc1vvloH5s","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Micronet","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1997-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"2ce339aa-fe3f-417c-a0cb-4ce17224de24.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"ad6f2b23-514c-457c-9473-0650eb6a75e4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"5bd05f16-2efe-4724-85d5-b7249ed828b7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"57614504-c79b-4720-907a-e1066e3523bf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"21a8b49e-587e-4a55-95ee-6eee2ea26745.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"99399619-1a4f-4695-bd49-7be0574c6894.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"e4a98f3f-8ec5-4ac2-a79a-1cd9f27220ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"645cfd0b-3bfb-4d09-92c9-f29f19906a9f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"d170fbaa-d23f-4302-aa96-a1e4f4f6eccb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"2c2d5a70-ecde-467d-986e-38daaff5c167.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"71f2bf62-d34d-4dc0-b5f3-bf18f29f67bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"6d2eb0f0-6e1f-461c-a2f1-380de8177611.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"FileName":"127d1685-6f78-4e4d-83ca-4f7acd4df741.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":11325,"AlternateName":"Deadalus","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11325,"AlternateName":"Robotica: Cybernation Revolt","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":2394,"Name":"Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It's the era of the Second Han Dynasty, and China is being overrun by powerful warlords.

The game is divided into adventure and battle modes. In adventure mode, the player controls Ichiro Ogami, moving around the theater (into which the base is disguised), trying to initiate conversations with the girls and choosing timed responses, which influence the hero's relationship with the girl and also slightly affect her parameters in combat. Battles are pre-set and take place on large isometric fields, on which the player navigates mech-piloting girls and Ichiro himself, fighting enemy forces in turn-based combat. There are two new characters in the game, and several refinements to the timed answer system.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Red Entertainment Corporation, Sega AM7 R&D Division","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1998-04-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"df1e6d9b-ef86-433f-839a-725d84b3c518.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"2a4f7cae-cba0-49e5-b3bf-f61ac09acfbd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"5c0d710c-927a-45a1-9035-d4021f39f754.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"967923f4-318c-43db-8c43-23249aab1621.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"11157b81-3d6c-447b-8881-4f57c43cc50f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"7eadf0ce-6d1d-4d0b-a7f5-350fc4401e4e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"aceee31e-aead-4cd0-89b8-f8042bfd199e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"0310f3e9-0597-467b-8b0b-203365974e50.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146544,"FileName":"2d0113b8-f2ff-4187-86ba-2fcf099e64a4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":146544,"AlternateName":"Sakura Taisen 2: Kimi, Shinitamou Koto Nakare","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":100880,"Name":"Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus is a compilation featuring ported versions of the arcade classic Salamander, its westernized port Life Force, and for the first time since its arcade release Salamander 2.\n\nIn all the games you control a lone starfighter as he battles the armies of Zelos, a terrible alien creature that threatens to eat the entire galaxy.

The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"9077de81-50db-4d2a-8c20-b2f0763f62a4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"23f76e3e-4183-4257-96c1-a46aba499552.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"a7afcd62-427d-4c99-85a3-51c20c91a8fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"b026054a-4c4d-4dde-96b9-b6bd9a1c6599.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"585e9052-8878-4737-9457-f29e1e582ac5.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"d2b18181-f610-4255-8ee2-6f895337b604.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140841,"FileName":"78efb2ac-09eb-4148-ac5f-4d4a41d95a92.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":140841,"AlternateName":"Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":175635,"Name":"Sangokushi Eiketsuden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sangokushi Eiketsuden (三國志 英傑伝) is an entry in Koei's Sangokushi series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175635,"FileName":"95eb7a07-3c59-43d4-b7e6-5cc2261231cd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175635,"FileName":"3e0c36bb-75fe-4116-90ed-8dc96a87ae5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175635,"FileName":"63092132-4427-4072-8da8-b85f913dc8cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175635,"FileName":"7a02069e-0b81-423e-a3c5-9abc7f117dff.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175635,"AlternateName":"Sanguozhi Yingjiezhuan","Region":"Asia"}]},{"DatabaseID":175636,"Name":"Sangokushi IV with Power-Up Kit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sangokushi IV with Power-Up Kit (三國志Ⅳ ｗｉｔｈ パワーアップキット) is a re-released version of Sangokushi IV for the Sega Saturn, adding the contents of the game's expansion pack (or \"power-up kit\" as it is known in this context).","MaxPlayers":"8","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175636,"FileName":"915c60a4-cdf8-4d54-85ee-3ac1439e5644.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175636,"FileName":"ded76a7f-8408-49e3-8de6-aee127d3384d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175636,"FileName":"49fba973-c6e0-4e0d-8e71-3a1d80fbbdb3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175636,"FileName":"379eeee9-4702-4040-a8a4-5457b1cbc811.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157161,"Name":"Sangokushi Koumeiden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sangokushi Koumeiden (三國志 孔明伝) is an entry in Koei's Sangokushi series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157161,"FileName":"eb8df4f0-1b93-4577-8f18-ae0c8a78ecc2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157161,"FileName":"be916031-34b8-4c24-8f1e-e23b8e526c54.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157161,"FileName":"a6eaef89-9864-4de9-acac-90667032b61d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157161,"FileName":"adaca91c-ff49-4e17-a82b-2b33018c318b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175637,"Name":"Sangokushi Returns","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sangokushi Returns (三國志リターンズ) is an entry in Koei's Sangokushi series, released for the Sega Saturn exclusively in Japan.

The novel, written by Luo Guanzhong, is perhaps the most popular classic book in China and all countries influenced by the Chinese culture (such as Japan). Its events occur in the third century AD, during the Later Han Dynasty. Several army leaders (the most important ones being Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian) are trying to unite China under their rule, and each one strives to defeat his opponents.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms V offers many innovations. You won't only participate at wars, but also manage your country, and learn resource management of people and goods. A new \"Reputation\" parameter directly affects the people's opinion of you as the leader. Multiplayer allows participation of up to eight players (playing the eight main characters).\n\nThe game was never translated into English.

Still, overall Savaki is a very nice fighter for those who like a little more skill involved in their games.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNszJ_7H1FA","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Cynus","Publisher":"Microcabin","ReleaseDate":"1998-04-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141051,"FileName":"83705c7d-61fd-4394-8cf0-85eee993e484.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141051,"FileName":"ad2a3a15-a91a-425d-a937-2b58dee69153.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141051,"FileName":"d476f019-5dc3-4ccf-988a-75aefd0e1f22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141051,"FileName":"aa12808b-46c5-40df-87bf-7a085d5e99f6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141051,"FileName":"7041409c-89a6-4792-bede-459d726ac464.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15269,"Name":"Scorcher","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Negotiate the fastest, smoothest and most undulating 3D terrain ever created, in a future-race where your bike defies gravity, and your opponents show no mercy.

Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct. But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support.\n\nThe game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun). With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter. You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns).\n\nThe game is fueled by music from \"DJR/IB3 LTD.\" (Darryl J.

As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre. It was also an early rally racing game and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer. It has been considered the best racing game of all time by Retro Gamer magazine, which ranked it at the top of its \"Top 25 Racing Games Ever\" list.\n\nAnother unique point about this game is the Game Over screen, the player is shown a faded out version of the title screen, covered by the words, \"GAME OVER\" in red; the player then hears an overly optimistic voice clip: \"Game over, yeah!\" This game over screen has gained some popularity across the internet. The music for the game was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sega AM3","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"b5445f93-ede7-4003-83fd-466f5965479e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"2a7daa56-8eec-421a-b7c3-842662531a3d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"d4231ba6-840a-4f8a-ad1f-8c59cd92252f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"be0356cb-099b-4769-a29c-a029b4ed6f59.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"3d35c340-c708-423e-a20d-3766987351d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"f728d020-d171-49f3-8e5d-00c76644b076.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"09982f00-237a-4b78-9de6-02fc61ed4878.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"512b927a-cb3b-4a4d-9603-383248704321.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"a4bc8ecd-adc8-463a-a65f-6eaacef0887c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"21ae6fe8-308e-41a7-94ef-248beeed2a81.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"e085a17e-ea82-4f9d-9dec-41cb9619a8af.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"2b9041d5-d223-450f-b133-1d4b49fae470.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"68a78a45-6068-404c-8336-2fc390674994.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"54da8e9e-fb86-4c8c-be67-cb43b6b13282.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"753a663c-2ee0-4e49-87c4-ea972f30d5a8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"a3ca63d5-ec04-48bd-a945-7ce79ba1bf68.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"93d6d233-5a13-462a-b695-b80aa52ed092.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11173,"FileName":"4373895f-e5a5-46d9-8b8d-705168f0a483.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125589,"Name":"Sega Rally Championship Plus: Netlink Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin McRae games.

After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega.\n\nLike with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an \"Arcade\" and a \"PC\"/\"Saturn\" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player. As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.\n\nAnother feature was the \"Global Ranking\" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only \"Global Net Events\".","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sega AM9 R&D Division","Publisher":"SEGA Europe Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"2d1b5f75-7625-40f3-a066-ae02a405b74e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"fffa3a11-2fad-47a3-a162-114cb7e8657d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"0dbe88d4-2d6b-4abf-af44-e9752746eb20.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"74fd71e1-4cec-4cd5-ab4c-e7a3d7cb8319.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"41d3cca2-6117-403f-b914-3aadf70d1257.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"8c94f25b-0d65-4c01-a774-947db340a74b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"fb5d5fe0-9f1e-4a41-a2e5-44a8e5f30d2f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"f0efdb55-013b-45ad-b488-b0cd9c5b8d31.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"8503e5c5-6032-4307-a1a7-971c6e9683c5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"ad03c5d5-50df-4d32-85d8-bbd7f0de678b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"8a3046a5-52db-4898-b871-c6f86c878b15.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"1a7a75f7-9ef2-468c-9b75-19ec6b28b68c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11339,"FileName":"e7d1be73-bb6f-49ff-ae12-3318518880cd.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10034,"Name":"Sega Worldwide Soccer '97","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 (known as both Sega Worldwide Soccer PC and Victory Goal Worldwide Edition in Japan) is a football video game by Sega released for the Sega Saturn in 1996.

The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until International Superstar Soccer 64 was released one year later.

Instead of just playing through each level and destroying enemies while avoiding getting hit, the player must also complete a special mission for each stage as well. Some of these missions range from collecting a certain amount of coins in a stage to destroying a certain object or enemies. Depending whether or not the player completes the mission will determine whether the player can continue to the next stage or what the next stage will be. Unlike the past versions, home ports of the game (exception of the PSP version) has cooperative multiplayer intact (where both players play simultaneously). It's also improved in that the game continues to play even when one player is choosing a character upon continuing.\n\nIn a 2-player game, when certain characters are near enough, a third-shot appears between them which can be purple shots that swirl all-over the screen, hearts that home in on enemies, or rockets that shoot straight ahead. This feature was first seen on Konami's arcade game Trigon.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"819e0e31-b45f-40fb-9368-f09c0e0c1e48.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"2549df7c-e793-4883-ac20-4173e455c9d1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"73cdc95d-b96a-419f-902c-f8a485f63be8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"72748ba8-b233-40ab-8787-7046351abeae.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"ef9c1690-a2ad-4fef-8d1f-3d198c073522.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"6082871c-06fc-4592-ad31-580a53b6a731.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"f68faad0-76f9-4cec-a08e-61a10dcdbcc0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"38bf1f00-92a5-4b01-9960-982da7143b2c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17648,"FileName":"bdd9fd58-431e-4fcf-b777-6baf969246fd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141065,"Name":"Shadows of the Tusk","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shadows of the Tusk is a turn-based strategy game where a player can build a party consisting of characters recruited in various ways which serves as their \"deck\".

He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father.\n\nJulian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny.\n\nScenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 & 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some \"overlap\". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Camelot Software","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1998-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"048bfb2d-c5e7-4d4b-b670-9b3fc5cc2d78.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"63cc2fe7-ab0b-4111-b09d-59e5b080d8f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"c2236c43-c235-4865-bfd9-7e942bc5ac79.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"677a213c-62ef-46fd-9987-30eee9f0f935.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"9c9be49c-8cc5-48e6-84c4-452fb944aa50.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"6778d1d2-6ba7-41ee-8779-3730671f0e7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"8d942889-9706-47c9-b1ec-d8fc96ef6051.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"193cd8ca-e758-4c02-92a4-29a05dbdfa00.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"a15332a3-c84e-43f2-9aba-7a5b5d2c03b5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"f64208fa-3682-48fc-8ece-a8c4c8503b93.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"cfbb0bdc-da69-411e-a1a3-effb181d9c8a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"d7d92b0f-738e-4f4e-bef0-2614b251f13c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"FileName":"1da8830d-4ba0-4ce0-85cf-5374f49631d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":11178,"AlternateName":"Shining Force III: Scenario 3: Hyouheki no Jashinguu","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11178,"AlternateName":"Shining Force III: Scenario 3 - Bulzome Rising","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":11179,"Name":"Shining Force III: Premium Disc","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shining Force III: Premium Disc is a Fan Disc for the Shining Force III series.

Two attributes emerged from the ruins, known as Silhouette and Mirage; like Yin and Yang, they cannot exist without each other, but are fundamentally opposed in their nature and ideology. Only a Messenger, one who contains both attributes in a balance, is able to get to the Edo facility and reverse back the genetic disaster, destroying both Silhouette and Mirage. This messenger is a young girl named Shyna Nera Shyna.\n\nSilhouette Mirage is a side-scrolling action game. The basic gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Gunstar Heroes. The game's standout feature is the concept of the two attributes. Depending on the enemy's attributes and the type of attack used by Shyna, damage can be increased, and spirit (equivalent to magic power) can be absorbed from enemies. Shyna can dash, jump, crouch, slide, and grab enemies, executing combo attacks. It is also possible to master moves, acquire money, and purchase special creatures called \"parasites\", which teach Shyna various types of attacks.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ8_xDqTqFs","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Treasure","Publisher":"Entertainment Software Publishing","ReleaseDate":"1997-09-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"c00597e5-d259-4f44-9d23-904aa6612513.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"a30d9944-6af1-4014-b1e4-17fd882334df.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"8e20fd91-ca59-4f97-b620-810027f67666.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"75866e83-b29a-4d84-8b93-d5d5a3043b13.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"5dec448d-ae22-4d27-9d1e-9a328bb0d998.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"2210e3e7-d53a-4186-b8e2-76ec0eccaf40.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"c5e40211-2907-4cb1-bd13-a27fae2c991d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"d5ac4286-c8ec-4da0-afb1-49b7e5ef63bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33645,"FileName":"9642b8dd-86ff-4839-82f4-83f69706b842.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11344,"Name":"SimCity 2000","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"SimCity 2000 is a strategy/simulation game developed and published by Maxis as a sequel to SimCity.

In towns you can move between multiple areas as well as look at objects and people to examine or talk to them. Lina will often get into (occasionally voiced) conversations with her companions, and in most conversations choices can come up that determine if the party receives stat upgrades or money. In battle each character in the party can be controlled either manually, or left up to an automated AI. Most characters can use magic, but each spell has a wait time that prevents a character from casting more magic until enough turns have passed. Characters do not gain strength or money from battle, instead strength is determined by how rested and full the stomachs of the characters are before combat.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Onion Egg","Publisher":"Kadokawa Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1997-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"a8f0ab70-9e6f-438b-9977-fb23d35ad54c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"a707a65a-ebb4-4a78-a4cc-b917bb2aa6cb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"185f4316-5357-427b-8e97-832e2807c2ac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"de4d6cac-f0d4-40fa-9aaf-3b44d0ae06e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"5bba2757-1ade-4adf-a5b9-5421a0268097.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"7132b5f6-0b75-4fdc-a548-776bb9ac33df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"386256f8-f938-4c97-a32a-5f65c0ce67c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157202,"FileName":"e0038ff5-bc71-436d-bd39-9491a51c3494.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157203,"Name":"Slayers Royal 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"That didn't take long.

You can no longer look at any object on a town screen, but there is now an event button that will automatically talk to anyone on the screen you're able to talk to. The passage of days from the first game has been expanded to include five times of day, and some events only happen at specific times. In combat the automatic turn system from the first game has been replaced with a more traditional one turn at a time. Terrain now has variable height, and can be raised or lowered with specific spells. Finally a spell's wait time is now reflected in the time it takes a character to cast a spell, making it possible to avoid a spell or attack a caster to prevent the spell from finishing.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Onion Egg","Publisher":"Kadokawa Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1998-09-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"2db241d8-2ff8-4d46-99b7-92bea62fd114.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"e145d76d-d481-480e-b309-0f1401e7802e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"ce803c46-983e-48f7-a1a9-049ac50548cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"9fa35489-bb55-4676-8590-d3cb43f7e679.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"b1090f29-87cf-4f2f-9778-68ae1d14e205.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"9d6d95f0-08a4-496e-a1d0-4fe23e6f51b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157203,"FileName":"22536742-72f9-4587-9d48-323b4bf34749.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128066,"Name":"Snatcher","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called \"Snatchers\" because they \"snatch\" their victims before they take their place.\n\nA new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as \"Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers\" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — is it a person or a snatcher?\n\nThe player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.\n\nDuring key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/IR-TwW21uBk","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"a576805c-c040-43f2-a028-654128b72e42.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"2bbb4037-c496-40a8-90f8-5f820fc9e52c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"9b5f8909-6992-4ed8-9768-432e2557c484.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"407c6e9d-0970-4ee9-9226-3c17ba009375.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"9509fd80-c6cb-4d47-a138-ecbc72d02d11.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"659809e7-ede7-48c7-91d6-7b2dbafd121a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"d0b7e1fd-0517-4e3e-98f4-db979779ec7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"65c4f6d4-760d-4b97-9f65-a4cc5884c455.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"3b39b52c-f6d0-4213-8c88-cf3a5993b8c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"1498b47b-3639-4228-8a7f-59d3e90881f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"33f0a9fa-cad4-4eb3-be60-77e13d3dacb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"29452c52-d462-4fda-b814-59b09e496774.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"a8803a99-69ad-4c5e-aa7a-646fc1441ff9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"4d7f21d6-2551-4705-9480-ac42c4b0133b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"daf1c0da-f23f-4363-ac81-fe34295a63ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128066,"FileName":"d1d44bf2-19af-4714-a9fc-8ae4a21748e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141431,"Name":"Sokkou Seitokai: Sonic Council","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Jinsoku Senior High School.

In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE_Ie0SKuUE","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Crystal Dynamics","Publisher":"Crystal Dynamics","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"b71a2109-7118-4e49-9824-908391ab465e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"6903ec9d-b9dd-4bf9-b1b3-b7bf60dddb55.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"33c540ed-c8a1-493a-8563-1628b666c704.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"b43430c9-bf46-4319-8c58-87e77bebe62b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"f0a081bd-90d3-4686-8984-063be660cf85.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"51fd3756-cb9d-4b5a-b315-620d56f087de.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"746464d1-fa7c-4330-810d-94528841de91.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"23dff933-2db1-49d8-b7fd-d145a39ad464.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"b976d909-7d55-4228-a184-c3754b5183b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"d94cf50d-018c-4853-9357-50d1acfca2bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"c864ee44-65ec-4f9e-a5f9-c2535b0350c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"805c5cfc-0047-4b3f-a782-743dc6c07c8b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"c4522c5a-fe1a-44b4-b1ba-4a4627740954.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"d27a4ff5-19e7-409c-98b8-a270bbdcfa97.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11347,"FileName":"f77748d2-806a-4e26-9e55-6b17c314a25e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":11347,"AlternateName":"Titan Wars","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":175724,"Name":"Soldnerschild","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Söldnerschild (ゼルドナーシルト) is a 1997 strategy game by Sega and Koei for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1997-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175724,"FileName":"28fa96b9-2955-4647-9a89-1945f197c483.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175724,"FileName":"8223e474-f628-4ece-a047-b94014392fc5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175724,"FileName":"8e6d72e6-a50a-4281-bb48-d16740af2602.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175724,"FileName":"d7003b48-f9d0-4b5a-857c-c6940aefbdc6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175724,"AlternateName":"Soeldnerschild","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":175724,"AlternateName":"Söldnerschild","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":128060,"Name":"Solo Crisis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Solo Crisis (ソロ・クライシス) is a simulation game for the Sega Saturn. \n\nSolo Crisis is often seen as the spiritual successor to Quintet's ActRaiser and ActRaiser 2, released on the Super NES (and published by Enix).

Because the original arcade hardware was directly based on the Sega Saturn architecture, this is a close conversion of the original game. Several options and features were also added, including a practice mode which allows the player to try out any of the game's stages without going through the entire campaign, as well as support for the Multi Controller and Mission Stick.  \n\nA bargain-priced version was released on December 1997, titled Soukyugurentai Okuyo, which includes a demo for the Saturn version of Battle Garegga.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMWhT7G_k9g","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Eighting","Publisher":"Raizing","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"e16aa5f6-a169-48cc-a3be-a7865b04821f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"ee061ff6-f79a-4b86-9d0a-928fe65f4998.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"c8ef3e38-8c59-45f4-845b-18814a980318.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"bc5625c3-361a-4c00-9b23-55732c3c8fc3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"ab63ea0f-c8c3-4a96-94cb-fd3b4ed4168c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"bf018b7b-2bf4-451a-b4b3-a5e372e1a357.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"40a691ec-72e6-46ed-87c8-328d87590b12.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"05288e56-bf03-4b70-8629-cb74c8f7429e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"7e84687f-3299-4845-b896-5de26180f85f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"a8e24c67-bd71-411d-b8c8-23db628ea817.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":107149,"FileName":"08bcdce0-47f4-4bb2-abed-21b2b41fa0be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":107149,"AlternateName":"Soukyugurentai Okuyo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"AlternateName":"Terra Diver","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"AlternateName":"Soukyuu Gurentai","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107149,"AlternateName":"Soukyuu Gurentai Otokuyou","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":175726,"Name":"Sound Novel Tsukuru 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The sequel to Sound Novel Tsukuru for the Super Famicom.

(Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) boasting the largest military force in history, suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania.

FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being \"convinced\" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.\n\nA remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times.\n\nIn post 3DO releases, only two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). The 3DO release contained several more, like a TV style fly-by-cam, weapon cameras, and enemy cams that could show a nearby enemies' POV.\n\nBy picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.\n\nOne of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.\n\nThe player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator","Developer":"The World Federation Entertainments Network","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"5eed4d90-2e44-48c0-99e6-95dc27ee12a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"d9db748d-09fe-44a6-8dba-d1a12d22a88d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"19c18379-0e7a-4d3d-a2dc-3fb72386c886.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"caaacbe8-9281-4272-b650-8c75cc25f4f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"d9196196-40f4-4460-98ec-84a4b3003299.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"36520052-0d28-4b22-80ea-b6ee31105f0a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"5d3ba8a3-142d-42fb-921b-dc877873b3ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"d302dcd1-98e3-4e0c-867c-f356bfe9614e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"d46eefc4-36f4-4372-91ab-dcbc06def35c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"92af0608-c807-43b3-990f-2f75ecdb1c8c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"55c15689-3b44-4d51-b419-89f8a956bc58.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"18f1e3d3-1656-498d-9ce8-eed54144a3de.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31209,"FileName":"4ee4db72-06cf-463d-985f-0ff834f3e7c6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":31209,"AlternateName":"Starfighter 3000","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":199033,"Name":"Star Wars: Rebel Strike","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":199033,"FileName":"4139b987-d8a1-4cd4-bddd-c5919a2be1f7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141351,"Name":"SteamGear Mash","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"SteamGear Mash is an isometric shooting and platforming game released exclusively for the Sega Saturn in Japan.\n\nGraphics are a mix of prerendered sprites and typical pixel artwork.\n\nThe games has mutliple stages, most of these are layed out in a maze like fashion.

In X-ism, players cannot air-block nor perform Alpha Counters, and can only use 1 Super Combo move in its powerful Level 3 version. Zero 3 also introduces a \"Guard Power Gauge\" which depletes each time the player blocks – if the gauge is completely depleted, then the player will remain vulnerable to an attack. The I-ism style is customizable when selecting which character and super gauge to be used, which is only exclusive to Dreamcast version's Saikyo Dojo Mode, or PSP version's MAX update on World Tour or/and Entry Modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr8NEv4SIP8","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting; Beat 'em Up","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1999-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"31462c89-f20a-465e-8ed6-8e101aee505a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"37bb4d87-e867-4d1e-8e8a-1f686bdf4274.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"d17816a6-a598-43e7-bdb8-84a2de02911b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"adb2d039-3ee6-4a3a-bc86-98776b4c802c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"ec00a043-844b-4cd4-a893-800454f762ad.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"9442ce36-8358-4397-a339-2faf2df70ce1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"8d726a53-73af-423c-a332-79ec4011a839.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"a8f9c9ca-ed73-488a-a8d4-09871ee48c9b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"f4c9c58e-e3a9-4653-98f3-18cefd670ee5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"71ea55fd-dfa4-44bf-9925-90936b949417.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"b457e3d1-f9a0-461e-830e-0c9a68769f9a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"68f0fbd1-9ddc-4fb2-abc3-090a8f0792a1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137977,"FileName":"f2c94817-afa9-4b02-87a6-640b1038b213.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11354,"Name":"Street Fighter: The Movie","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Street Fighter: The Movie, released in Japan as Street Fighter: Real Battle on Film (ストリートファイター リアルバトル オン フィルム?), is a head-to-head fighting game released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1995.[1] The game is based on the 1994 live-action Street Fighter movie and uses digitized images of the film '​s cast posing as the characters in the game.

Rensa Hitsuyou (天地無用！連鎖必要) is a puzzle game based on the Tenchi Muyou! franchise. \n\nThis is a match 3 style puzzle game combined with the popular Anime Tenchi Muyo. Its gameplay consists of lining up chibi versions of the series characters and pulling off combos. Your main objective is to pull off as many combos as you can and keeping the water and blocks low by lining up blocks of the same color, which in turn fills your opponents screen with water. When your opponents chamber fills with water and they no longer have room for any more blocks, it's game over. \n\nThere are ten levels, each pitting you against characters from the series. This game can be very difficult at times especially at the later levels. I like the fact that you can choose different characters from the Tenchi Muyo universe. I liked that some characters are more defensive than offensive. For example, when some characters gather enough blocks they will do a special move depending on what character you are using. They might lessen the water that fills your screen, or another character might be more offensive by flooding your screen completely giving them a somewhat unique feeling. There are also some hidden unlockables that you can acquire after you meet certain conditions. With its charming gameplay and wonderfully animated animations, an average amount of replayabiliy and funky music, it makes for a fun distraction for Saturn puzzle fans.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Access","Publisher":"Pioneer LDC","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141444,"FileName":"6fb9db77-e1ec-40f4-9d98-e34f9e1affad.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141444,"FileName":"180fc131-4af5-4257-a177-fd219687b897.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141444,"FileName":"3ea9ed02-a019-4fdf-b5df-2e1dfaa22a6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141444,"FileName":"baa7db88-97f0-431e-a792-67c9b6e3e3a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141444,"FileName":"b88a9083-9469-4031-ab64-90835e5457f4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157281,"Name":"Tenchi Muyou!

Once the ship has multiple sections, the player may also split it, allowing it to fire in multiple directions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Nihon Bussan","Publisher":"Nihon Bussan","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"cb309d14-8feb-4227-beb5-44170985be8c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"44a44f17-7802-4061-a44f-7b946d70d82c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"226522fb-4b07-49c4-a899-8f719c835827.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"e7acdd7c-3d3e-48c7-849b-787bdc1113fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"6749ac77-7934-4b82-84b5-439556c463ab.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"08809471-22e9-4335-a8ff-7aa353145c85.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"f03b1f2b-b715-4eb7-ba29-06af1e0374af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141450,"FileName":"eea9cb16-750d-4224-9aae-320ae01d280d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157285,"Name":"Terra Phantastica","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Terra Phantastica (テラ ファンタスティカ) is an RPG for the Sega Saturn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Chime","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157285,"FileName":"c2b17b22-f234-47c8-91de-8c07308f5844.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157285,"FileName":"a5a955bc-5b0a-4ab2-a652-9c0c0f8aeda7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157285,"FileName":"fcce36ab-ade5-4b89-8ea1-4f53ae796b42.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157285,"FileName":"e768e3fa-b600-44fb-8e1a-2a1f4820b82b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157285,"FileName":"a1d35bb6-d3f4-49d0-9295-fe1ec69b5b37.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11359,"Name":"Tetris Plus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game consists of two main modes, Classic Mode and Puzzle Mode.

However, a programmer working for a corporation that seeks the downfall of the simulation developers infects the system with a virus. This virus creates a dimensional vortex that threatens to swallow the entire world. Stanley Opar, a member of S.A.V.E (Special Action for Virus Elimination) enters the vortex with one goal: destroy the virus before the universe ceases to exist.\n\nTime Commando is an action game with light puzzle-solving elements. The player character travels to eight different time periods: Prehistoric, Roman Empire, Feudal Japan, Medieval, Conquistador, Wild West, Modern Wars, and Future. Each era has its own characteristic enemies and sets of weapons: for example, Stanley fights with rocks and bone knives in the Prehistoric era, switching to shurikens and katanas in Japan, revolvers and shotguns in the Wild West, laser pistols in the future, etc. \n\nMost of the time in the game is spent fighting enemies. Character navigation and combat resemble those of Alone in the Dark. The navigation is character- rather than camera-based, similarly to survival horror games. During combat, Stanley has three attack moves at his disposal, as well as a blocking move. Part of the challenge relies on choosing the right weapons against particular enemies. \n\nStanley starts with a small life bar that can be increased by picking up life power-ups, as well as multiple lives. Time limit is imposed on each level. To lower the countdown, the player has to deposit computer chips collected throughout the levels in special orb pools. The game utilizes animated pre-rendered sequences to represent locations, and polygonal models for the characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Virtual Studio","Publisher":"Acclaim Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141452,"FileName":"d017675d-d835-4789-b8a8-bb9b301a95bc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141452,"FileName":"6d4a0acd-111c-4fc5-afe2-0194ba3ccc08.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141452,"FileName":"e60769a4-771c-4cac-84aa-2ea92f931ef9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141452,"FileName":"c326168d-2f11-40e8-8c41-bb53c59a89d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141452,"FileName":"9ae1b653-5796-43d1-a29e-72abf8cd1a3f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141453,"Name":"Time Gal & Ninja Hayate","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Time Gal & Ninja Hayate (タイムギャル＆忍者ハヤテ) is a compilation of two Taito LaserDisc arcade FMV games, Time Gal (1985) and Ninja Hayate (1984), for the Sega Saturn by Ecseco Development.

The player controls a cartoony-looking taxi cab and has to get past various levels mostly set in urban environments. Some enemies can be defeated by simply jumping on them, but others have spikes and fire on their body, so in order to defeat them the player must use the Super Dash move, which grants an increased speed for a short amount of time. The super dash meter takes away gas, but it is possible to charge it up as much as one wants until it maxes out. In addition to killing enemies and bosses, super dashing can also break down certain walls that lead to secret items. Bosses each have a weak point somewhere on their body that is seen just before the battle begins.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biB13V_NeIk","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"System Supply N‑Tech","Publisher":"Nihon Create","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"2b71d47e-4603-48cf-b46f-ac6cad2499c1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"ff5581b5-0ae0-49ff-b836-b1f1dcd3fd83.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"84b0b8c0-9e82-4ce5-9951-e4c52a39023c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"ec8183d8-2e8e-44da-948a-d9672580e2a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"fb73bb45-9479-487c-80f5-f1b1b69c9be9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"b97fd54a-b163-4447-9da2-35ca7ff778dd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"f0ae281c-60d9-4a1d-a7bf-214f6216a56a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31389,"FileName":"9fa27ab6-ec89-4990-8f54-4160744373f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141458,"Name":"Tsuukai!!

Never has this been more apparent than in Bandai's recent Japanese release, Ultraman Legend (or more specifically, Urutoraman: Hikari no Kyojin Densetsu). Based on the popular Japanese television series (some incarnations of which have made their way to the States in the past), Ultraman Legend is a 3-D fighting game, of sorts.\n\nIn an interesting departure from the norm, the game tackles 3-D using rail-based movement (similar to Crystal Dynamics' Pandemonium). Instead of acting within a large circle, the gameplay takes place along a railed line. This only becomes apparent when one of the fighters is launched backward and begins to appear into the foreground (often knocking over those large buildings that have become a staple of Japanese monster movie cinema), until the screen compensates and reverts to the standard 2-D side shot. Like I said, \"3-D fighting game, of sorts.\"\n\nIf you're a fan of the old TV series, you're in luck: The gang's all here. The heroes consist of the original Ultraman, Ultraman Jack, Ultraman Taro, Ultraman Ace, and Ultraseven. The real stars are the monsters though, such as the earth burrowing Gomora, bizarre doughboy Eleking, Godzilla lookalike Redking, the \"evil Ultraman\" Ace Killer, clunky robotic King Joe, Gamera-like Bemstar, colorful lobster-head Metron, and Ultraman's main nemesis, Baltan.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SIMS","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141459,"FileName":"21a846be-557f-4d65-b16c-0d47ce207ffb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141459,"FileName":"56964309-30f1-4184-b3bf-7328c8e3de48.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141459,"FileName":"61fb837b-1f84-4b4a-871b-c247d66e0b5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141459,"FileName":"3b36228b-f1c3-46f2-a0f5-d1e4fd0a5642.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141459,"FileName":"cf70d7d6-a8e7-4ef0-b621-4265867bd8f1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176103,"Name":"Umanari 1 Furlong Gekijou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Umanari 1 Furlong Gekijou (馬なり1ハロン劇場) is a horse racing game for the Sega Saturn released only in Japan.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Micro Vision","Publisher":"Micro Vision","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":176103,"FileName":"f83489fc-a021-4976-90ff-8958acef3e17.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176103,"FileName":"19db83a3-f5e8-4184-9981-835c3a56416a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176103,"FileName":"fa16f3b1-a0a7-4132-b75f-5ec552b16486.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176103,"FileName":"7c78a100-fdaa-4136-8fb8-fa03c4512208.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176104,"Name":"Universal Nuts","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Universal Nuts is a sci-fi visual novel featuring two protagonists, Yui and Ai, which get involved in an incident onboard a space station.

The game retains the character roster of Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors, omitting Donovan, Huitzil and Pyron from the lineup. Taking their place were four new characters: Jedah, Lilith, Q-Bee and B. B. Hood. It also features a secret character/mode, Shadow, where the player assumes the identity of the defeated character for the next fight (e.g. if Morrigan is defeated, the next fight the player will play as Morrigan).\n\nVampire Savior eschews the traditional round-based system in favour of what is dubbed the \"Damage Gauge System\", where battles take place during a period of one round, with each fighter having two \"life markers\" (equivalent to two life bars) by default, which diminish after one character runs out of vitality. The player can also regain a portion of their life during battle if they manage to avoid taking further hits. The game also introduces the \"Dark Force System\" which allows players to perform special abilities unique to each character for a limited period.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Gq_ecYsic","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1998-04-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"0ca69cac-1837-4eac-944d-45cc54060101.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"3eecd7fe-f1e5-4722-9d0e-b5c6a1ddcb1f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"ddf6dd06-a8fa-425d-9395-43a61d07c296.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"ef9a8771-95bf-470e-9840-a6f10b27e31a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"097350da-fdb4-46f8-9461-b74441c0c12a.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"c9a410c6-470e-4709-85cc-e958f796302e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"58f54f4d-d6b0-48a5-b1c2-3589e5f18bf5.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"da2e046e-2420-427f-90cf-a73dc7fad87d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"f26278c6-270b-4b2f-b6d0-15e1b6c0da82.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34640,"FileName":"ef63eee4-5b30-4bfb-8266-4711d5908db3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176110,"Name":"Vandal Hearts: Ushinawareta Kodai Bunmei","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG.

Each fighter has a distinctive fighting style, and their own set of signature moves.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl895zXjfyQ","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Sega AM2","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"1fad10fb-3923-4918-879b-ec0d49bf685d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"89e3b043-7b23-4187-a668-955ac9d480a9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"2520ea3a-d7cc-4aaf-b897-fe85dfbce985.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"42190941-31cb-43e3-8b10-30fea9c7f0c1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"de07abf4-7a70-41f0-9e35-da8fc4ab2761.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"84ec267b-8bc0-4aaa-bdd1-12e002848b2a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"8cc7ac7c-d412-49aa-95e2-fda86395b555.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"b432a0da-6277-4194-8909-9fb948af7f6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"0cbdedfe-3344-4be0-ab77-6de9aef3189c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"afd2dc90-36b0-49ad-8a67-b4fe3165c3fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"72b0c176-e905-4d81-b406-13bdcf322b1d.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"decac258-7809-49ac-9ca0-96144f4411e0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"7e699528-8030-43cb-8a0e-ba19d79ed5e6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"70368988-ec58-45ce-8fa9-3a7e1cc22213.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"c7c64ead-e914-45a1-a777-cf84fb618a09.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"1b05fd66-f19e-425c-a127-c1312102978f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9269,"FileName":"0e503893-ffc7-423f-bf9a-f34c33c120db.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5635,"Name":"Virtua Fighter 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Virtua Fighter 2, the intrepid fighters return to the World Fighting Tournament.

Human beings have long reached outer space and traveled to other planets. But they could not find happiness, and soon their only source of feelings became the \"Cyber Net\", a virtual world where people could experience simple emotions such as love or hatred. One day, a deadly virus was discovered in the Cyber Net. A special unit called Blue Metal was sent to annihilate the virus. But something went wrong, and the members of the unit were killed. Serge Shadix survived, but his brother Leon never came back. This accident made Serge join a force called STAND (Special Team for Alert to Network Destruction), which specialized in cybernetic crimes. Will Serge be able to solve the mystery and discover the secret of the virus?\n\nVirus is an adventure game with elements of a shooter, similar in concept to Snatcher, but with much more developed and frequent combat. During the adventure portions of the game, the player views locations and talks to characters from first-person perspective, interacting with the environment by selecting command icons from a bar on the bottom of the screen, and then moving the cursor on the screen to select the object to interact with in a point-and-click fashion. The game has many more puzzles than most other Japanese-style adventures; most of them are logic- or memory-based, though a few require the player to explore the environment and use inventory items.\n\nThe protagonist often enters and explores first-person 3D dungeon-like areas, where he can physically move around and also encounter enemies. Battles take place on a separate screen; the hero fights by aiming at enemies and shooting at them in real time. Each action in combat costs action points (AP); once the main character's AP bar is depleted, he cannot perform actions until it refills gradually or until the player uses an AP-restoring item. It is also possible to use shields and various offensive items during combat. Weapons and items can be bought in stores. Many boss battles require the player to locate the enemy's weakpoint and attack it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"c62e4f64-ae9f-4b52-815e-03900d683f9d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"dc0d2870-8f34-4b95-b0cb-ea4bba941dbd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"d6fe5f0f-eb33-4760-b241-13849362cde1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"20e2649c-b498-4ed8-8d6e-0cb59b26f86d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"5c627cdc-3acf-46d1-a6b6-2d4d626a2dc0.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"bdf9c6f2-60bb-4aea-90c9-9a5f94c6476c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157344,"FileName":"0ccd7145-c615-40a2-902b-ef0bea08f057.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157305,"Name":"Voice Fantasia S: Ushinawareta Voice Power","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The hero of this game is a young man who enjoys playing video games (don't we all?..).

The hero is teleported into an alternate world, a kingdom that is a mixture of medieval and modern day-like environment. This world is in danger, and only those who have the magical \"voice power\" can save it! The hero meets the young female magician named Whip and the princess of the country, Fret; together, they must stop the evil and figure out a way for the hero to go back to his world.\n\nVoice Fantasia might look like an RPG, but in reality its gameplay is much closer to the adventure variety, the RPG elements reducing to a mini game-like status. Most of the gameplay here is dedicated to exploring the world, talking to characters, and acquiring and using items needed to advance the story. The infrequent turn-based battles are dictated by the story. Three girls join the party, and are able to use \"voice powers\", which are in effect attacks of various properties. There is no experience system of any kind.\n\nThere is also a mild \"dating simulation\" element in the game. The player is able to buy presents for the girls, invite them for dinner, etc. When staying at the hotel, those anime-style fantasy characters are replaced by video footage of real voice actresses. The player is able to talk to them and ask a variety of questions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Japan Media Programming Inc.","Publisher":"ASK Kodansha Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157305,"FileName":"0da462d9-66fb-4719-9f18-1902f5a2a35e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157305,"FileName":"53dda269-c9a4-4a8b-a1f4-e6d819bb252b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157305,"FileName":"0d8abe28-c24f-4e99-b8fd-9ec2ad87c7b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157305,"FileName":"8ee7c426-6d5e-4680-8c8f-5aa25adfa053.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157305,"FileName":"7e7bcd3f-7d91-4dba-8fd4-491b84a58072.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141481,"Name":"Voice Idol Maniacs: Pool Bar Story","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Play 6 different pool games with 8 seiyuu using the system of DATA EAST's\nSide Pocket 2(Minnesota Fats - Pool Legend in NA release)\n\nyour opponent include:\n\n Nishihara Kumiko(Iris Chateaubriand in Sakura Taisen)\n Fukami Rika(Aino Minako/Sailor Venus in Sailor Moon)\n Shinohara Emi(Kino Makoto/Sailor Jupiter in Sailor Moon)\n Nishimura Chinami(Neko Musume in GeGeGe no Kitaro)\n Takada Yumi(Masaki Aeka Jurai in Tenchi Muyo!)\n Ikezawa Haruna(Seiba Go in Bakusou Kyoudai Let's & Go!!)\n Kingetsu Mami(Fujisaki Shiori in Tokimeki Memorial)\n Shishido Rumi(Kouda Mikako in Gokinjo Monogatari)","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports; Board Game","Developer":"Data East","Publisher":"Data East","ReleaseDate":"1997-04-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141481,"FileName":"65c8856f-851c-4f7a-a12c-688b13340f65.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141481,"FileName":"611a96a4-0a0f-43d1-9dcb-e737a20224a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141481,"FileName":"c56cc2c4-7947-422a-8b65-2124c80d449e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141481,"FileName":"794a11fc-64a9-4d2d-820f-50361b48c50f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141481,"FileName":"f6b473f0-27fc-4ef2-94fa-7cbb43033e4f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11372,"Name":"VR Golf '97","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It's just a game like the Green Jacket is just a sports coat.

Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the \"Model 1\". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion.

It met with poor sales - in part due to the system's declining popularity - and was soon to be forgotten by the public in spite of its initial critical acclaim, which made an already unlikely localization impossible. It's very upsetting that such a game would tank, because the guys behind it were kind of a dream team. It brought several major figures together including Yasuyuki Ueda and Yoshitoshi Abe (of Serial Experiments Lain fame), art deco-anime artist Range Murata (popular for his work on Last Exile), established composers Satoshi Miyashita (Wings of Thunder) and Takayuki Negishi (Tengai Maykou IV) as well as the founding member of the legendary progressive rock band King Crimson, Ian McDonald, as surprising and unlikely as it may sound.\n\nThe game is set on the foggy and highly socially stratified Edward Island, and follows the misadventures of Lucian Taylor. His younger sister is bed-stricken due to a pollution-related sickness that has made her extremely light-sensitive, and his irrational guilt about this state of affairs - \"Why am I the healthy one?\" - pushes him to devote himself to her well-being. However, her eventual death forces him on a quest of vengeance around the desolated lands to find Sword Emperor Duran, who he holds responsible for being the manager of hazardous water treatment facilities. The plot doesn't wander into epic battles and maintain a touching and introspective tone, supported by superb hand-drawn artworks, as well as an overall oppressive feeling through unusual cutscenes featuring scale models by a trio of experimented modelists - Takayuki Takeya, Fujita Yasuo and especially Kito Eisaku, who also designed the Nerve Tower of Sting's first person dungeon RPG Baroque which was released around the same time as Wachenröder in 1998.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1998-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"132a6203-268b-4959-ad4a-f8d710141216.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"51bb04f5-49a6-4ab0-9244-56fc0e57571f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"16235f91-2167-4d89-bba4-8e7cad9fd768.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"ec7f0a2b-6b17-4083-9ce0-2d53f994d46a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"82e58682-d252-40e1-92a6-7108cfbb31c4.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"2fff1a2a-c1a7-4047-afc4-68dece5df9b5.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"f85136d9-39c1-4a5f-bfd3-7dd697d19b5a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"492d42fd-528e-41f8-8752-28d0f2edb145.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33718,"FileName":"36337d15-2c4f-4939-86da-7fbc76d9edab.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33718,"AlternateName":"Wachenroeder","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33718,"AlternateName":"Wachenroder","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":141482,"Name":"Waialae no Kiseki: Extra 36 Holes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Challenging and gripping, Waialae no Kiseki: Extra 36 Holes is a nice choice for sports lovers.

Now, players must help Keaton find a way out of the mansion.\n\nThe game never takes itself seriously, featuring a lot of slapstick humor and a laugh track when Keaton uses an item in the wrong place or gets into a trap. There are no enemies, Keaton can't die in the game and the traps that are scattered across the mansion are mainly for comic relief making it kid friendly. Players will need to locate keys, books, food and other objects and use them in the right place to get to the locked rooms and progress through the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Highwaystar","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1997-06-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157346,"FileName":"78d0a33c-ece1-4719-8b2f-0fc6607ea03e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157346,"FileName":"cdc5d509-dc7f-4da2-ac39-ef0da96a3972.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157346,"FileName":"c413e32f-d1ad-42fb-9b1a-6811910e51bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157346,"FileName":"71fbf034-31d5-490b-ad90-0a31d2a79245.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164483,"Name":"Werewolf: The Apocolypse","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Werewolf: The Apocolypse is an unreleased Sega Saturn game based on the role playing game of the same name. \n\nThe game was cancelled in late 1996 after a troubled development cycle, which had seen the game turn into an action RPG (originally being just action), and the closure of publisher ASC Games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164483,"FileName":"159eb365-11a3-4920-abd7-50f6bae45159.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164483,"FileName":"a068e752-87e6-4ba5-8973-ea2dd66a17ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164483,"FileName":"1cd79703-9cbe-486b-9b94-5821e622ddc0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164483,"FileName":"84e9c6e8-42b0-4908-ae60-1f368462c71d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164483,"FileName":"a8859129-a993-46fc-9203-6a30c2456ddf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164483,"AlternateName":"Werewolf","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":11375,"Name":"Whizz","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint.

Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path).

Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena). \n\nThe game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:\nSpeed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.\n\nSki Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).\n\nDownhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.\n\nShort Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.\n\nSkeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.\n\nSlalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.\n\nAerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a \"click-along\" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses\n\nBobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.\n\nSpeed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.\n\nSnowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.\n\nCross Country:\nThe stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Data East Corporation","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1997-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"bb57654b-4638-4775-83ad-33a24da3d8d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"2ad47157-51b2-4f57-9a7c-6d3b58855af1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"1a98b775-ff88-4d98-a2c2-0f2e527547e5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"bab66b87-e8bc-46b5-a63b-359b87e25cd9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"d701fc46-95e2-45b2-bafd-f791abbca71b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"8e567a4d-11c3-49cf-9953-105ec2663b91.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"aa3c2609-75ea-48e2-9f0e-1ba73921fc96.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"6e425b65-360b-4b0e-8306-bae2d273fd29.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"d3c5b1f6-2076-481a-8bf9-06cc5fe6669b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"bb791965-73c3-4e0d-ba52-99d46a82f82f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"95b680e0-5edb-4adb-825d-909937d9d246.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"c1347cdc-1f01-47ef-b414-07a4a8a991f3.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"2fe779a4-a13e-4856-a299-2951b2b2f0ae.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11376,"FileName":"826dc8be-9284-4485-8b7f-f57a3a2fcca1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2427,"Name":"WipEout","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"WipEout is a futuristic racing game set in the year 2052.

As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed.

It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.\n\nGameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozToO80S2J8","Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Team17","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"77587dae-c099-4d49-a212-760977c91f96.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"379d52dd-a4d3-427d-acfb-bb6d0de93cbf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"0c782120-7263-461a-a16c-509e9f01ee4b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"f148ac1f-f3f6-4d60-ae9d-5f5b1dcc953a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"24fc8333-c769-4ce6-b3da-d3170b9447ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"cfb051b4-6f6a-4887-b228-b067da805334.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"7cdd35d4-f18a-47b8-82e5-cf603876ef34.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"b31244bb-067f-4498-89ef-b1ae7496c2a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"4d4747d2-41e2-4edf-bdd1-7e4cdaf298bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"ba58bb60-96fb-47a3-9b56-9fdd45fc6689.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"4f88facb-cc03-4624-bc8c-26ebcfbd0ec7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"2ec85e56-f471-43b9-a974-c55eb1b5f9ad.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7943,"FileName":"fd01267d-a09e-40f8-bbe5-60c79433d85e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11380,"Name":"WWF In Your House","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"WWF In Your House is a successor to WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game.

A seemingly ordinary Japanese high school student named Yumimi Yoshizawa sees a strange dream about a unicorn couple in a magical land. When one of the unicorns suddenly falls through a hole in the ground, Yumimi wakes up, realizing she has fallen out of the bed as well. The following day brings more strange occurrences, such as mysterious hopping blobs and a strange girl who professes her love to Yumimi. Eventually Yumimi and her friends realize that all these events are connected and that it lies in their power to protect our world from monsters. Though not based on a manga or anime, Yumimi Mix has characteristic anime-style plot and visuals, and is built like an interactive cartoon movie with animation and voice-overs.

It is similar to the arcade game Plotting, but runs in real time.\n\nYou are a colored triangle standing in a 4x4 square in the center of the screen. Lines of different colored objects appear from the four rows on each side of the box. The goal is to destroy those objects before they go on your square. A, B, and C shoot. If you shoot an object of the same color as you, the object will be destroyed and you will move on to the next object in that row. When you have depleted the row, you will move back to the square (facing the opposite direction). If you hit an object of a different color, you swap colors with that object and return to your square, allowing you to shoot different-colored objects. Therefore, the keys to success are timely color swapping and fast reaction (especially since you come back to the square facing the opposite direction).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Saturn","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"PanelComp","Publisher":"Viacom New Media (US/EU), Media Quest (JP)","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"884c055d-5e00-4e2a-afb5-77250248a857.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"0621f4b6-a9d0-42e0-b926-7adf0423bb19.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"0c5218e4-f848-4e75-8ddc-9180b7a8021e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"17953d75-30eb-4cfa-a7f4-800048c82e79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"c806f0ca-5cd9-4363-809a-c7a784519571.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"5746394f-aeba-4664-ae5f-1cd8a60b15e6.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33737,"FileName":"a9f0715a-287a-44a4-bd0e-6c73e7df5cbb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33736,"Name":"Zork I: The Great Underground Empire","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zork I: The Great Underground Empire (ゾーク・ワン) is a text-adventure game originally developed by Infocom for various computers in 1980.
