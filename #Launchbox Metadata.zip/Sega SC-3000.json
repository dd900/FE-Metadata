This means that the player can shoot three shots at a time but it also means that enemy projectiles are harder to avoid since the ships take more space. However if hit the size of the squadron will decrease. The player has two means of attack: a regular fire for shooting down UFOs and a bomb attack for taking out ground targets.\n\nIf a high score is attained a mystery target will appear.

The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door.\n\nIf a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life.\n\nIf you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door.\n\nAt other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins.\n\nThere are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.","Publisher":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"166055":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"9ee40061-32bd-42b0-b80d-de447c9c7ac3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35b905f4-290f-40fd-992d-f722f929937a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Championship Lode Runner","Overview":"A follow-up to the original Lode Runner, with identical gameplay.

In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others.\n\nIn between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you.\n\nIf you're good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.","Publisher":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"166103":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"79270c00-54fa-47f2-b80e-103838feb13f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"4253fedd-fe07-4cca-ad3b-0e50ab62f126.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"23f8aaba-1605-4889-a051-b331b240fbcc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c9c0fc18-18e0-4992-9608-f9ee65cf969d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"44b8ab20-7a16-4a93-97be-9a9d49fbbe9a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"90a42596-606d-4e3b-8f9f-1ffff215f902.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4ee8adcb-1eea-4161-95f9-d57c66c4c507.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1e08f7ec-d116-4b0b-b2aa-850e02300f6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6e60ef59-a8ac-40be-b86b-ecb2fd530047.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ninja Princess","Overview":"Ninja Princess is an action shooter.

You live in the sewer, and you are hungry. Luckily, the sewer is filled with cheese, only it is guarded by menacing creatures such as rabbits, turtles and bats.\n\nIn order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"179798":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"32c5d597-b00b-433c-8447-034d3f7e68bf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8292de3b-f905-4bd9-b367-4c517e68653e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"31dbcbef-1cf9-494d-83e2-6260dadf9f00.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7ca2c300-a9b6-4ad1-8afa-5daaad2b3195.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b221177-4600-4ce1-900b-478183261fa4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4d1515ad-34a8-4c9b-981d-c38375e55c90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sindbad Mystery","Overview":"In this top-down action adventure game, you play \"Sindbad\" the sailor.
