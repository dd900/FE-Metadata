Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.\n\nSince the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point.\n\nOther rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.\n\nIn a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Irem Corp.","Publisher":"Irem Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1983-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128072,"FileName":"0858295f-d77f-4d86-a307-a1bd6cba9136.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128072,"FileName":"c751aebe-cbb6-4747-81da-9adb6a874296.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128072,"FileName":"f8d6ccdf-e443-47fe-9d48-05b147cbd3af.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128072,"FileName":"ffcdd808-ad25-44af-a2cd-9f7070382327.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128072,"FileName":"10bffe46-27fc-48de-8742-641bed8d994a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128072,"FileName":"607d6470-9d50-49cc-b8e8-fefc7c47abd8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93120,"Name":"180","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The player competes in 501 darts against other darts players waiting in a championship tournament with normal darts rules applying, subtracting your score from 501 to zero whilst finishing on a double.

Alone and without proper equipment, you need to transverse the great forest to reach civilization while avoiding deadly wild animals and several other kinds of dangers on the way.\n\nAmazônia is a text-adventure in Portuguese from Brazil. One of the first computer games commercially released on that country, it has a parser inspired by the ones of Infocom and other companies, although not nearly as sophisticated (it has a small vocabulary of 40 or so verbs, it can't process chain commands, but understands pronouns). One unique characteristic of it is the requirement of accentuation on the Portuguese words. The game even provides special key combinations as shortcuts for accents to ensure compatibility with all systems.\n\nGiven the plot line, the gameplay has a strong emphasis on its survival aspect: even though it is written in first person, the game bizarrely complains about being thirsty (\"Hey, I'm thirsty!\"). Wild animals randomly appear to threaten the player, and must be dealt swiftly to avoid death.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IMjiE44DUI","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Renato Degiovani","Publisher":"Ciberne","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182609,"FileName":"d531f368-e97d-431f-971a-14f2476ebd72.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":182609,"FileName":"ba6d3645-4b06-4590-983d-d6b06f07cb9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182609,"FileName":"1e21c081-56d3-4bc3-a09a-0606da1034b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182609,"AlternateName":"Amazônia","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":94851,"Name":"American Truck","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"This is a slightly strange game where you drive a giant 18-wheels truck racing recklessly in a highway and knocking out of the road innocent cars and ambulances.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM-ELG4OjTw","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Telenet Japan","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"7cea958b-1f6d-44bc-bee2-d222df862934.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"bb4e6c8e-6d4e-41f4-ab16-474f62322b14.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"cb7147b5-3fcd-4365-b6fe-7634a04a0f9a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"2a209f78-c1e6-4efa-8d4e-882b6416ee7f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"1043c1f1-aea2-489b-929c-76b529ea7edb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"8c210683-3c09-49c5-b369-01d4debb96b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":94851,"FileName":"357fc44f-3a18-4472-bdf9-675dedd68b3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":142346,"Name":"Amida","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4e8WmhRaS8","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142346,"FileName":"dd982aa4-6dcd-49e8-a39a-5ce3c3414eb6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":142346,"FileName":"f527120d-6236-4f4e-9943-5eacf1c22e09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":94880,"Name":"Amo del Mundo","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Accept the challenge of the Master of the World. Cross the red line if you want to get a real taste of danger. Enter a zone of no return for many. You just need to dare!\n\nRecharging energy (pressing down)\n\nRobur \"The Conqueror\" is an evil genius inventor who has built the \"Espanto\", a vehicle capable of running, sailing, diving and flying. He is also endowed with a powerful weapon 200 times more powerful than any known weapon ... and with this he intends to become the Master of the World!\n\nJohn Storm, Washington's chief police inspector, has gotten himself an FBI survival kit and heads to the Robur base to try to stop him. In the middle of his dangerous mission he is discovered, captured and brought before Robur. This, in addition to telling him his plans to exterminate the earth, has destroyed in several pieces the electronic plan of the main circuit of the \"Scare\". John has managed to break free and get his special equipment to decode the plans. Now, he has to go through the 8 levels of the base in search of the pieces of the plane, decode them and disconnect the electrical equipment before time runs out, will he succeed? ... that only depends on your skill.\n\nArriving at the teleportation platform (the one on the ground, activated by pressing down)\n\nWe control a character who will have to go through 8 levels in search of the pieces of the plane. In each phase we will find dangers such as lava floors, defense robots ... We have three lives and an energy bar that we can recharge on platforms. The latter is essential since with the amount of defenses that each area has, our energy goes down at lightning speed.\n\nIn each level there are 2 different types of shards. Some green ones that will rebuild 2% and red ones 5%. To play this game we have to have a quadrant of codes at hand because every time we take a piece, a code will appear at the bottom of the screen and we will have 15 seconds to find the correct number. If we are right, it will add a percentage and if we fail, it will disappear without adding anything.\n\nWe have 20 minutes to finish the mission.\n\nThe game has very colorful graphics although quite ornate. They wanted to put so many details on the screen that sometimes we don't see the enemies or their shots coming.\n\nIt happened without pain or glory. I had this game in its day and it was one of those that \"got lost\" in a game exchange with a classmate. A pity because although it is not any wonder, it kept me entertained for a good season.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRCaX670LzQ","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Positive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":94880,"FileName":"b664ba55-3fe0-4f1a-b499-fded915b1a11.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":94880,"FileName":"55bd844d-fa0d-41a7-876d-e56ce5986fd3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":94880,"FileName":"ce366547-1c08-4cfa-bdd3-85262fa39c64.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":94880,"FileName":"b57b02f1-ce2e-4fd9-b081-bb5409fac3ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":94880,"FileName":"19b77404-031d-4994-b0ed-81e4bba2ec7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138291,"Name":"Amoto's Puf","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Your life was quiet, with your job as a messenger, in your small town.

You could not do anything, until you remembered that saying: \"If you can not defeat your enemy, join him.\" And so you sent your request to the head of the group. The answer was affirmative, but yes, you had to go through a tough test that had already passed some of them, as lame Johnny, who lost his leg in the test. You should go through a circuit prepared by them without hitting Larry «Kamikaze». If you manage to complete it, your problems will end. Luck!!! Objective: Playing with this typical arcade is very simple. You must eliminate all the luminous points of the screen, passing over them with your blue colored motorcycle, trying not to hit the motorcycle that circulates in the opposite direction and that is violet. For this you can change the track and use the accelerator. If you manage to complete the circuit you will receive a bonus on your marker and you can easily get extra life if you manage to collide with the violet bike in a time limit. Of course, here you can not use the accelerator.

Lesser known is this game, Animal Land Satsujin Jiken (“Animal Land Murder Case”), despite following the same mold…except all of the characters are anthropomorphic animals. The story puts you in the shoes of a rookie canine shamus named Oidon, as he investigates the murder of Gonkichi, a fox and owner of a jewelry store. The story gets even darker when the case interweaves with the suicide a panda named Linlin.\n\nThe game plays out similarly to all of the others of the era, as you select various commands to investigate crime scenes and quiz suspects. Through rather than the first person labyrinth you explore in the Famicom version of Portopia, instead here’s an overhead scene where you explore a complicated forest. This aspect that makes it stand out, of course, is the setting and the artwork. Due to the limitations (both resolution and palette) of the MSX, it looks quite a bit different than typical adventure games that appeared on the PC88, but the artwork itself is excellent considering its limitations, with a distinctive and appealing style.\n\nHuman-like animals investigating crimes actually isn’t all that out of th  ordinary for the Japanese audience – after all there was a cartoon earlier in the 80s known in English as Sherlock Hound, featuring a canine version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective. (It’s well worth checking out, especially as some episodes were directed by Hayao Miyazaki in the earlier days of his career.) But the concept isn’t just used for stylistic purposes – all of the characters being animals like dogs, cats, foxes and pandas plays into the game’s shocking twist ending, which absolutely couldn’t be done in any type of murder mystery. (As a clue it’s sort of similar to the setup of the Dreamworks animated film Penguins of Madagascar, which was released nearly two decades later. The title of the game also gives a vague hint.)

In level 5 the soldier must jump from rock to rock in a river, shooting hostile birds. Thereafter, the soldier makes his way into the enemy headquarters with the goal of retrieving secret documents.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Dinamic","Publisher":"Dinamic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91421,"FileName":"876b047d-ac94-4d37-a1ca-f7ac3fdb10f2.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91421,"FileName":"57aad0c8-6fc5-42be-a4f6-8e51bbcea225.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":91421,"FileName":"b32657a4-e34a-4270-ba5a-4a04b89232e3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91421,"FileName":"9c6fab67-7262-4723-acbd-9ad93af58791.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91421,"FileName":"ae6453ec-d61a-4eee-935a-4baabbf11bbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91421,"FileName":"e34e9124-3b6d-4d2d-a320-2bd7a5bfa255.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185898,"Name":"Around The Clock","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":"Al Alamiah","Publisher":"Al Alamiah","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185898,"FileName":"8619578b-9af7-4bd6-bb0c-87bc3094a1b4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":185898,"FileName":"df366869-a3b5-4082-8a88-0d90e9a353d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185898,"FileName":"80ae0e4d-8ceb-47a3-923c-a250177c48d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":94924,"Name":"Arquimedes XXI","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Arquímedes XXI was originally released for the Spectrum and MSX machines in 1987, and for the Amstrad CPC in 2011.

The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. \n\nIf a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. \n\nIf you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. \n\nAt other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins. \n\nThere are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138295,"FileName":"3b5f88ae-8a08-4466-a047-edbfa9bf848e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":138295,"FileName":"e8cf3e63-4a7e-40f1-a3ff-be79a3b08fa4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":138295,"FileName":"d759b994-b54b-4236-a31f-60f0c2218059.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138295,"FileName":"088decfe-f303-428f-8df3-c6a5a77fb700.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138295,"FileName":"52836913-1ca1-4041-8352-4223c47432b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185079,"Name":"Banzai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Unknown","Publisher":"Unknown","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185079,"FileName":"91c039ac-d9ae-4db4-9b29-0463ea9a4aec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185079,"FileName":"755b3c01-ff1f-46e0-820b-9e9f296dd70f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95660,"Name":"Barbarian","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Barbarian is a 1987 computer platform game by Psygnosis.

A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.\n\nThe game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures, but it’s a bit more complex than, say, Irem’s Kung Fu Master. It’s not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you’ll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas. It’s not entirely clear when you’ve actually done this though, because there aren’t any indicators that you’ve hopped onto a different path unless you actually walk in a different direction and notice the change in scenery. Indeed, most other games that used this structure had things like warp doors, which at least made it clear when you’ve jumped somewhere else. There is an early item that will display an onscreen map, but it only shows your vague location as a tiny dot, and instead expects that you’ll map out everything on your own. You’ll need to find several other keys and items, power up the hero, and find the Wolf Castle before you can beat the game.\n\nThe whole game is  confusing, but made infinitely more difficulty because the action is very poorly implemented. The hero tanuki may be skilled in martial arts, but he’s still not very good at them, because his attacks have absolutely no range, making it hard to get in attacks without receiving damage at the same time. Foes spawn constantly and move at the same rate as the tanuki, making them impossible to outrun. It’s here where the game presents some comedy, as defeated foes are literally flung across the screen. Additionally, these baddies are apparently so thirsty for tanuki blood that they can be lured right into the many, many holes that litter the forest, sending them to their own Wile E. Coyote-style doom. You’ll actually be doing this a whole lot if you want keep your health up too, though falling into those holes will also instantly kill you. Technically there are no continues, but there is a password function that lets you pick up with your items intact.\n\nThe theme song of the game is pretty catchy, if repetitive, and Technosoft apparently thought so highly of it that the package includes an audio tape with arranged version of its two tracks. (These were both included on Illusion: Tecno Soft Game Music Collection Vol. 1)\n\nBatten Tanuki no Daibouken is definitely one of those games where its wild concept is more interesting than the game itself, which doesn’t really capitalize on its premise and is painfully stereotypical of 1980s computer games. Alas, Technosoft later found their niche with shoot-em-ups like Thunder Force, and never revisited the concept. The idea of action hero anthropomorphs may have been more popularized by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a few years later, but darned if a karate tanuki isn’t a great idea for a character.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tecno Soft","Publisher":"Tecno Soft","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":132912,"FileName":"beaa83e9-6d88-47c2-a8f2-9b5f98d692ae.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132912,"FileName":"426f3636-9672-4dc2-bb14-89ab4466234e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132912,"FileName":"198f8d99-93c7-4c3d-a768-66a5898b67ff.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132912,"FileName":"7f2b8c75-a640-433d-ba21-9f368b509209.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132912,"FileName":"2304f0a2-6246-4988-b081-74f4047469b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132912,"FileName":"6d6a2009-72e2-4b2f-bf21-aab6aee63772.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95671,"Name":"Battle Chopper","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Battle Chopper is a helicopter shooter where the aim is to destroy as many tanks on the ground as you can before you are destroyed. The screen is split into three parts with the main screen showing you looking at your helicopter from behind at a 3rd person perspective flying into the screen showing any tanks on the ground. Another part shows your damage status and score, and finally the third part is where you play and control the game. This part is a radar and it shows the tanks coming down the screen and you control two bars up, down, left or right, and where the bars meet is where your weapon will hit. The tanks will fire missiles upwards at you and you can be hit three times before it is game and this is shown by your helicopter changing colour in your damage status. You have two weapons and they are cannon and missile and you can switch between either.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"System 4","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"1c76d61d-5c34-4228-a0b8-9f46d2e3de2b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"518dc84b-bea2-4234-baa8-d1ad474da640.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"a25f3e7d-4380-4831-99cd-e29e8228a6db.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"f658a3bf-7ffb-45df-ab2d-85813b443d95.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"31be630b-1e16-46b5-8ad2-b2d62e73aaf7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"9dc7c9d4-42e7-4e10-ad24-ca863e7bd6dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95671,"FileName":"7cca3038-d0ff-420a-9174-d10295f17b69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95672,"Name":"Battle Cross","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"A basic shooter where you fly a space ship and have to shoot fleets of ships that fly in from both sides of the screen and loop around in formation.

Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.\n\nThe port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL0caWe9MNw","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Access Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Eaglesoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"8c32d3e0-41ae-4283-aab1-6fd1783c45f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"eedf72fe-7e0c-4361-8adc-e38808edb467.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"bc772ee3-bbbd-40c2-b716-56ca621fd345.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"cf237eb9-35b2-487b-ac05-0e1c683529b6.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"7761de74-0ad1-424f-ba06-5353a7ffb603.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"45153637-870a-4672-8cbf-e4c39dab6d49.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"b3681e74-0b7f-4d6a-84b6-4e261cbe5d9b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"c64f1366-7ffd-43c2-b20e-9884b6b099ae.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"0ecb8c67-0931-496c-a9f3-d60b8d1139ef.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"8a78c09e-5d16-4887-8c55-e43831f50a73.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"76513be9-53b6-42d0-b673-8d9cd2b985d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95674,"FileName":"34c3bb81-068e-4411-b6be-25743b93d32e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95675,"Name":"Beamrider","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Beamrider takes place above Earth's atmosphere, where a large alien shield called the Restrictor Shield surrounds the Earth.

Each consists of a regular grid of indestructible walls, randomly placed destructible walls, and enemies (Floaters) moving between them. The goal of the Bomberman (or Eric in the UK version) is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/Prw5lPLcsXI","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"fa9b3bf3-99c4-44df-9506-7516d5118007.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"ff5b481a-37d3-44d8-8416-5cbc21f72773.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"544cbef7-7367-426f-bda7-0f2509e85c72.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"e69ae04f-15fe-4d68-835f-6c862a55b7e8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"31e15a27-e4ee-4cbb-b263-949847a12dd3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"99352ccf-2e18-4c27-99c4-f6b8d23743db.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"effad3c0-0919-485a-b5ca-027755cabab0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"c9764fa5-be16-4080-b841-ab15a75a4540.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"89ffb652-3a65-4aef-a205-f0e1614c70dc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"305896dc-017b-4652-8678-82195a3036bd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"0aa5af94-d74f-4599-b0cd-d5d3940036e3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"0e661baf-49f2-4f69-be79-52e6c3a8ccd5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"80a93127-4eeb-4deb-a576-57b4f1174e3f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"49612f11-8fd7-4b77-9f53-e548ca8ef310.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"beb3e0cd-f8ab-4bd0-bb06-3a56853f26db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"aa642daa-4174-4bc3-9035-edeb682436fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"FileName":"5599d6c2-b848-4b37-8607-db72ebb2f0bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":34169,"AlternateName":"Eric and the Floaters","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34169,"AlternateName":"爆弾男 Bakudan Otoko","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":190286,"Name":"Bomberman Deluxe","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A hack of Hudson Soft's Bomberman Special with modified graphics showing the good looking/cute style of the actual Bomberman series.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Jon Cortazar Abraido","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2004-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190286,"FileName":"df34dc7b-cb3b-47d9-8a4f-b6f8f255828b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190286,"FileName":"82a73843-d80c-47ba-8342-3e52b5cf6b84.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":101795,"Name":"Bomberman Special","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom.

In fact, in addition to movement, the player only has a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (four directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. The goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"16ba9262-d241-428a-804e-4c4dbabf1893.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"6a458b4b-b67a-4c18-b521-9a5c2b013420.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"e427cd89-ff45-4e07-af84-014534dd8cdb.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"7948c4ea-b9f0-4ccb-9532-a4b1c6a113d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"218fcd86-197e-49a2-87f1-a25365bf425b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"c5d42758-08e6-4a34-86c6-8a323171a8d6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"8cb32fda-a366-443f-82cf-aa66c5059921.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"c49ef697-67c5-4a16-ba77-280b44750c26.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"03bc2a35-fbb5-4e62-bdbd-78dca3d3c776.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101795,"FileName":"ad494476-ab30-42ae-86a1-993962c9920a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":101795,"AlternateName":"Bomber Man Special","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":152801,"Name":"Bomulus and the Lost Crown","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The third Bomulus game is a walk-and-pickup adventure based on the same general principle as Atari's original Adventure of moving between rooms in a castle, picking up objects and looking for a special item – in this case, it's a crown.

When a key is held down a gauge at the bottom of the screen begins to fill up. When the key is released, Bugaboo will jump in that direction, with the strength of the jump being determined by how long the key was held down. The cavern is made up of various rocky ledges which Bugaboo may land on; however he can only stand on a flat area and, if a jump is mistimed, Bugaboo may end up on an angled area of rock, or miss the ledge altogether, which will cause him to fall straight down, landing on whatever is below.\n\nBugaboo may fall from any distance without dying. The only way for the player to lose a life is for Bugaboo to make contact with the large, yellow dragon which wanders around the cave. Bugaboo can escape the dragon by carefully leaping away, or by taking refuge inside one of the smaller caverns that are located around the play area.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9fA7Cwjcxg","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Indescomp S.A.","Publisher":"Quicksilva","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"97a41a9d-263e-435d-b637-c6425b5807e1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"6b0fc20a-07f9-4a8f-8dcc-138ba4b6eaa3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"f58d2a71-d21a-420d-a467-01214ca5ba01.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"8503c34c-3bb1-434e-a7c0-f9d850f1ba15.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"0b142124-5420-4ccb-8f80-84d39deceba3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"cdd3b774-8188-4c3d-a9ef-252300127fe1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"7f0c36a8-a3d4-46fb-b468-5c903757758b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"c6aaf37c-9568-4a17-a0ca-4f4dbde18251.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":142500,"FileName":"54d4f528-4cb7-4033-80f9-c3a4da704d00.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":142500,"AlternateName":"La Pulga (Bugaboo)","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":132915,"Name":"Boogie Woogi Jungle","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Boogie Woogie Jungle is an action platform game, published by Ample Software, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUtdphShV4c","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action;

The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions, and can fire both forward and backward. Each round consists of a number of green enemy bases that must all be destroyed to advance to the next round (a semi-transparent automap helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later rounds the core is capable of defending itself (opening and closing while launching missiles).\nAdditionally, the player must avoid or destroy stationary asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships which attempt to collide with his or her ship. Enemy bases will also occasionally launch formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) will also appear occasionally, which must be destroyed or the round will go to \"condition red\" regardless of how long the player has taken.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWhAIIhRjI4","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namcot","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"8f07868e-07d7-4d6f-8105-7cdb5fc567c0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"6d5ec326-4e65-4747-9a41-a7157e96f7d5.PNG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"c3a8808c-3433-46e9-aa74-1f1f08ec0a65.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"a5079456-6bbf-45f6-8226-1c5b67ed0f69.PNG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"b27fca6b-e1d5-4395-948e-7fdfbea677cc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"7fdff5b2-5874-4538-afb9-1b304810445a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126508,"FileName":"a7809226-7d07-4780-a52e-4a42b5dac379.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":126508,"AlternateName":"Bosconian Star Destroyer","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":132984,"Name":"Bouken Roman","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q8F3gpiqCg&ab_channel=FunCade64","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"Computer War System Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"b0b64145-3d6a-44c7-9306-515bc995e245.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"e7871341-c8b2-4231-8a2b-d56b009827be.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"46c8c94c-8350-46fe-a6e5-e043da640c50.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"a6658b31-cd99-4226-807c-c14646870314.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"f501a3e9-5010-4f52-bd68-844d96a9b1d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"4578a1ba-1ce8-488d-8276-db4450e2cf63.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132984,"FileName":"b318a8e6-818b-45c1-b2c3-15093776952c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":132984,"AlternateName":"Bouken Roman: Dota","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":133120,"Name":"Boulder Dash","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"You are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds.

The player controls a tennis ball which is used to navigate courses, composed of numerous tiles, which are suspended high above ground. The ball must be bounced past walls and over enemies; coming into contact with either, or plummeting over the edge of the course, results in the loss of one of the player's seven lives.[1] Courses feature power squares, which push the tennis ball forward and allow longer jumps, these must be utilized to complete the course. Power squares are also used to enable the tennis ball to reach mystery spaces, tiles with question marks, which contain extra lives and bonus jumps which are used on bonus screens. Mystery spaces can also destroy the tennis ball, resulting in the loss of a life, through instant destruction or by freezing the ball in place while a missile flies across the play area and explodes.[2] The bonus screen is accessed every time a course is completed, it consists of mystery spaces which increase the player's score when bounced on for the player to receive. 40 bounces are allowed on each bonus screen, though this figure can be increased by the player uncovering more from mystery squares during the preceding course. Once all bounces are used or all of the mystery spaces are bounced on, play moves to the next course.[2] Bouncing on all mystery spaces awards the player 10,000 points as well as an extra life.[3]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146770,"FileName":"d959abb5-eafc-4861-9e36-7b356b0675f5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":146770,"FileName":"375fa372-954b-4863-9092-f1f5acb87fc1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146770,"FileName":"ed3b78fe-6af9-434d-969f-1145180b322b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146770,"FileName":"510769af-82e0-46f1-8031-59468c7b8f08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":152842,"Name":"Break Free","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Ec0-75hBQ","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Rolf Fokkens","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":152842,"FileName":"0f4a6044-a16c-4955-a26c-1f42dbe1489e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":152842,"FileName":"e4e66d09-d75c-46af-b481-072055620af4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126518,"Name":"Break In","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"You have to prevent a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks.

For example to enter some houses Clever needs to use one of his trademark disguises or in the sewer they can tap telephone phone line with the right tools. Another important resource is money which is used to buy items, disguises and food. The latter is essential for survival because a hunger value constantly rises when the heroes don't eat.

The board is an 8x8 square on which white and black tokens are placed. The starting position has two tokens of each colour diagonally opposite in the central 2x2 square. Black then places a token so that there is now one or more lines (of one or more consecutive white tokens) between the placed token and another black token. These lines can be either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and results in all of those tokens being flipped to black. The same rule applies when white plays to flip black tokens. Players alternate placing single tokens at a time, and must flip a token each turn. Only if no legal move is available can they pass. The aim is to have the most tokens of your colour before both players need to pass.\n\nThis version of othello allows play against the computer, with up to four skill levels.

As a result, some very obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as 'bigot' and 'sheen' are queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly.\n\nInputting words is done by moving the cursor across or down to the starting position of the word, and then pressing to key the word in, pressing space before the letter you wish to use a blank tile as. All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually rearrange them, and you can watch the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves and their scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Psion Software Ltd.","Publisher":"Leisure Genius","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"2c13bfae-8a4d-4da4-a7b9-e18d4fc673f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"c00f2542-0beb-4a5f-ab11-1bc178781129.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"a0b8a92e-322a-45a1-b8ac-807bb8f8b92b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"45b83b92-b4a7-40f5-88b3-c58e71637879.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"7cb9d825-806e-4f4b-bdc4-43130c05711b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"f9c2be39-1460-4473-8506-49adb4dc159b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188829,"FileName":"db80fb4e-7269-4c3a-ab94-ce56b3f2384e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":191968,"Name":"Computer Wars","ReleaseYear":"2004","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Crappysoft","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":191968,"FileName":"69576995-e5f8-46c6-b875-e9130e1fbf86.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":191968,"FileName":"7a04fc7c-bb91-4ca7-af32-81984b3a75c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":191968,"FileName":"57a269ff-7c69-42a5-8678-17155c385f9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153120,"Name":"Con-Dori","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Cross Talk","Publisher":"Cross Talk","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153120,"FileName":"b60c3dda-4fb9-49db-a8fe-ecc6a3280549.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153120,"FileName":"2ad53cad-7673-4f5d-bd58-916dc87d7583.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153120,"FileName":"2dba4c40-fd3e-459e-85c4-b7223feb29f9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153120,"FileName":"b8e1cf59-b784-4c60-bdcb-d51b424cbe70.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153120,"FileName":"f7e99567-bcc3-4fae-bf9c-86163bb7a2c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153120,"FileName":"ebc67cc1-5ce8-4ea6-968c-9577f756f02e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153121,"Name":"Confused?","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The subtitle \"The moving puzzle game\" should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated.

Perseus starts with 2000HP, but his health is constantly being drained one point per second. Enemies are attacked simply by bumping into them while holding the Space bar pressed.\n\nStory \n\nLocated in the south of the ocean is an island, where at one time resided a flower garden inhabited by three Goddesses of beauty named Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. However, the island was invaded by a Gorgon and her followers. The Goddesses entrusted the Twelve Constellations to the residents of the flower garden, but they were found by the Gorgon and their hearts were turned evil.\n\nThe sorrowful voices of the Goddesses reached Zeus in the world of the heaven, and his tears became rain that wetted the ground. Zeus called the Hero Perseus, and a sacred shield and sword were bestowed on him by the Goddess of Wisdom Athena and the Messager God Hermes. Perseus then headed of to the southern island.

The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through.

Putting them together will get you a tank and help you eliminate  enemies with just a single shot as well as blast doors open to escape.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Animagic S.A.","Publisher":"MCM Software","ReleaseDate":"1989-03-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153192,"FileName":"85c7c595-561f-4f21-aaf4-f32142e9908a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":153192,"FileName":"b9d4b236-17b8-4d52-8ce0-8217348ca7be.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153192,"FileName":"0dfda663-4a66-4515-9170-06dcb905d034.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":153192,"FileName":"a3cb23d5-d882-41ab-8586-a7b56a626118.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":153192,"FileName":"3dffb96d-f869-4494-b617-1c6506280063.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153206,"Name":"Cyberun","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"The planetary system called \"Zebarema\" is the only place in the universe where you can find cybernite, the hardest material known to man, and key to generating enormous power and wealth.

Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, mean street-walkers and the police who occasionally will help you take out the baddies. If you start shooting policemen, they will turn on you too. The upper half of the screen shows you the side-view of the street or building you are in. The lower half shows your score, high score, injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can know where crime is taking place, a compass direction, a map which will also show you where weapons and bosses are located, and which weapon you are holding and the ammo left. When you enter a building, you can fire out the window for higher points but beware of enemies that may come up behind you.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138777,"FileName":"7cc8e6ee-fdc1-4a7f-a2bf-24ec9df64571.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138777,"FileName":"310f29ba-e996-45c6-ba66-2ea353b675d7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":138777,"FileName":"345847eb-76c6-46d0-8517-64a4a5f53b7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138777,"FileName":"37c00310-d95b-4465-9cda-098ef5b50ed1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138777,"FileName":"16237924-03a8-4e17-9081-9eb508824f77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138777,"FileName":"a51c6c65-347d-40fe-9ae9-d5917a854091.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193427,"Name":"Deep Dungeon","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Deep Dungeon is very much like Wizardry with the exception that you are not controlling a whole party but a single hero through eight maze-like dungeon levels to get rid of the evil overlord who is responsible for kidnapping the princesses soul.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Scaptrust","Publisher":"Scaptrust","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193427,"FileName":"112aaaa6-8fb0-4e32-99c7-51341fed5299.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193427,"FileName":"e6233001-daeb-41a4-bf4a-7c9973f03911.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193427,"FileName":"427877f1-d8d7-4f37-9488-dde8fc1c45d4.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193427,"FileName":"8a6e65dd-57ff-4c1c-a25f-6a3e55fa9cce.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193427,"FileName":"f4be5b30-e42f-4ddd-a22c-e1aa5100c88f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193427,"FileName":"a94a9c74-8f93-49be-9df3-05f037ca3f68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":193427,"AlternateName":"Deep Dungeon: Madō Senki","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":133167,"Name":"Deep Dungeon Adventure","ReleaseYear":"2008","Overview":"Deep dungeon is a single player turn-based exploration game.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.

The player navigates a lone pre-made protagonist on a top-down overworld, accessing locations represented by icons, similarly to early Ultima games. As opposed to most other RPGs of the time, dungeons are viewed from an overhead perspective as well. In cities and palaces it is possible to talk to people, rest in inns and buy weapons, armor and items in shops.\n\nWhen wandering around in the wilderness or through dungeons, the player character encounters randomly appearing enemies. Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting menu options while fighting. It is possible to attack with the equipped weapon, cast one of the few available spells (using up some of the magic energy), use an item, or try to run. All the battles in the game are exclusively one-on-one.

The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and \"bump\" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.\n\nThe player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9c4Pg4C5cs","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Square","ReleaseDate":"1985-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"bc534400-02a6-4437-817a-478a9a3318aa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"558ac79a-d8d8-43da-abd3-4f26a111944e.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"e27482e2-38a4-497d-b9c4-3be7727f26f6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"5070a261-b65a-4990-8b8f-1d1f4069ebb8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"4926addf-91da-4e9f-9dbc-131ddd01b127.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"bcab74a6-3e6b-4abd-9a1a-8fb117917c89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"e029d7c3-2284-4dc9-b1c2-f55b1600e74b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33789,"FileName":"24e5b024-54e1-4d4d-a116-09692fd9f69e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132938,"Name":"Dragon Slayer IV: Drasle Family","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.\nThe player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.\n\nThe object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":132938,"FileName":"3967b04a-9ae7-4586-a089-3c13a180a23e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132938,"FileName":"62c3cd72-466c-4389-a003-18b5e4352c71.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132938,"FileName":"21a09f41-beca-4e8a-bac6-31135222152c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132938,"FileName":"2a264ec9-181f-4fcf-b8e0-8dcd08aa8c9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132938,"FileName":"74b88275-b591-4ea6-9632-859b901b2c03.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132939,"Name":"Drainer","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"'Think before you act' is the maxim of this game.

Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences.

Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.\n\nEnemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:\n\n    Shooting them with his gun.\n    Kicking them by jumping onto them.\n    Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.\n    Crushing them with an elevator.\n\nWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.\n\nWhile Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall.\n\nJust because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.\n\nOtto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.\n\nIf Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Nidecom Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"9047c478-4a0f-436b-b47d-e3baff20474a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"73100094-cd6d-446c-8045-779d474e7282.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"cc02ebfc-949c-4830-b092-a9e2dd8eb2e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"842e6f02-7d01-425e-9b82-139de98423d7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"7a60bc04-4e55-49f4-9359-3338256ddc09.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"9ccbd2b0-3fa3-4491-b7e3-2a63b2af381c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"096a1771-c030-4b42-82ad-64ef7c0eb4c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132945,"FileName":"1ec7c50f-dadb-4145-b242-a2e2f242059f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153308,"Name":"Elidon","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Winter has gone and Spring is upon us.

The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.\n\nElite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/qaTrl1mlCQE","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator","Developer":"Mr. Micro","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182739,"FileName":"67e45cd8-dc30-45ab-a539-dc9d08215fbb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182739,"FileName":"d015ea64-dd07-4923-ae0d-dc8ee6ad78bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182739,"FileName":"22302a2a-de00-4aca-9fcd-771b8f892ce3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":182739,"FileName":"3afc255b-a0a9-4659-9dba-f42f412de335.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":182739,"FileName":"88d0f1c0-cf32-4fef-9650-4534305ffbff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182739,"FileName":"ce51a1b2-9134-4481-8bdd-c7681bbf571d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153309,"Name":"Emerald Isle","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"You have been hired to deliver important documents across the Caribbean.

Controlling Walky, a yellow ball with legs, you must pick up all fruit strewn across the platforms, while hunted by the Nyankys. Walky can't jump between platforms, so the only way to reach another platform, and more fruit, is to walk off the platform and go to one of the trampolines placed on the left and right of the screen. During his walk, Walky is a prone target for the Nyankys, who will hunt him from all directions. Walky's only defence is to drop on the head of a Nyanky, and his ability to lay bombs, of which he has a limited supply. Only one bomb may be laid at any time, preventing you from covering the screen in bombs. Jumping too many times on the trampoline will make it burst, costing Walky one life. When all fruit are picked, the game proceeds to the next level, with new platforms and another kind of fruit.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO9RJ4uYI5s","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138858,"FileName":"a58919c4-1a7d-4322-8be3-cae08dd8a47a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":138858,"FileName":"f8a98442-9752-47ba-990a-3295a084413f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138858,"FileName":"13a7d7b0-ab1e-4fad-b186-f34ef2340794.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132956,"Name":"Fruit Search","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Fruit Search is a clone of Mastermind, however instead of your traditional round balls or pegs, you use colored small fruit shaped pieces.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8duTZKF80","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Board Game","Developer":"Takara Co., Ltd","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132956,"FileName":"1168895f-8e43-45ef-bd35-534af0faa2f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132956,"FileName":"457d57f3-88e6-48fd-806b-debc3f582e63.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132956,"FileName":"fd190775-dc80-4e3a-bcb8-25520c12a6e8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132956,"FileName":"2720fc2c-db9c-4b67-a93d-5cb9c5a60c44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138859,"Name":"Fruity Frank","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"You control Fruity Frank as he tries to harvest all of the fruits on the screen.

A very important part of your ability as governor will depend on your arcade experience when it comes to conquering the territories surrounding Mongolia. You mission will be to invade the Chinese Empire, and for that you must tear down the Great Wall using gunpowder.\n\nUnfortunately it will not be available from the beginning, so you will have to conquer Baghdad where the secrets of gunpowder manufacture are kept, and then dedicate your task in destroying the barrier that prevents you from the victory. But it will not be that easy, you will also have to defeat several enemies of varying difficulty.\n\nThe game makes you choose between arcade, strategy or a mixture of both. In the first category you must use the joystick to defeat the owner of the chosen land. The screen turns into a side-scrolling game in which a Mongol warrior, sword in hand, must face the enemy hordes. Each soldier you kill equalizes to five in total, and every blow you receive means a loss of five units of yours.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Positive","Publisher":"Positive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"debe0645-e111-4b54-baec-a7e0683e02d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"114d08e9-3b3f-401c-a160-21eb7fbefef9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"a707f147-461c-428a-b7b7-2af19f191b3c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"f95511bb-c514-490c-ad3a-575b215f6628.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"c18565a4-46c3-4e2a-885a-676a6c67b72f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"130448df-e7b3-4f4e-a2a6-a7263fcda3ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133067,"FileName":"30ceba99-2f6f-47c9-b4ee-8fb177c95080.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202178,"Name":"Geo","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Get the 22 geometric figures scattered around the labyrinths, gardens and forests of the big city.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Mind Games España","Publisher":"Mind Games España","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":202178,"FileName":"a14368c7-e8d5-4550-800c-1785681e929e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":202178,"FileName":"1ef90b8b-4fe1-4502-8c50-e4469355046d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":202178,"FileName":"eb2b027a-a293-40d3-91a1-9a6dbd71f84c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202178,"FileName":"5d06461a-2622-4a47-80ad-947d175ba04c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":202178,"AlternateName":"Geometría, Figuras Planas Y Volúmenes","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":202178,"AlternateName":"Figuras Planas Y Volúmenes","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":202178,"AlternateName":"Geometrías","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":201132,"Name":"Ghost House","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Youkai Yashiki (妖怪屋敷? lit.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8IZheqcxsg","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"e4076712-2894-4289-a1e1-c7341166960a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"36c70795-72ed-453a-8020-a4e3b78ed4d6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"90f7d613-839b-4d57-9da5-045595475f8b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"f4f6e852-63e1-42ef-a131-5b8fc5ac39b1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"346a4b8a-f5c4-40de-b073-8f24e591885f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"61230530-ea20-41b2-8db5-c1c3317bb554.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"577494f4-569e-41ab-ade7-bc0b1375a09a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138872,"FileName":"493e1feb-6fbb-4109-8d28-cf0caaf1bb65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138874,"Name":"Ghostbusters II","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"The UK-produced adaptation of Ghostbusters II contains three action scenes based on the film:\n\nIn the first scene, the Ghostbusters must collect slime samples from the sewers. One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected.\n\nIn the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled.\n\nIn the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGa_jKS3AMA","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Foursfield","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"fded1fc3-4f66-4bf1-95b6-4e5b6ec1afbc.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"c7710a9b-62fa-401d-b1e6-7fdefe2754a2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"1d39801d-3a0c-48fd-9644-ec614e7623f4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"29849b64-523d-4887-b561-c042061fa058.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"ecadcb2a-e774-4610-b936-59b5040cf5d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"1973cb7b-de7e-4325-8938-aaa224f3b500.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138874,"FileName":"5f15683d-edfa-43f8-9c98-5069bb0ce06f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":138874,"AlternateName":"Cazafantasmas II","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":153464,"Name":"Gilbert: Escape from Drill","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Gilbert: Escape from Drill is an action game based on the animation series Gilbert.

Gorf is a game that consists of five levels:\n\n    The first level called Astro Battles has the player's ship behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.\n\n    The second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.\n\n\n    The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.\n\n\n    The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.\n\n\n    The fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core.

Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found:\nMagical Staff – Vanquishes RPG slimes.\nHoly Cross – Vanquishes ghosts.\nSacred Sword – Kills ogres.\nOnly one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels.\n\nThis adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Karoshi","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138984,"FileName":"dee93a4a-40a1-472d-b1ea-41f31540fad2.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138984,"FileName":"16bd72e1-2117-47fb-9fb4-5a4c7de0bc1d.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138984,"FileName":"9610d282-1727-47e9-a813-f2a619c15542.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138984,"FileName":"d200a43d-700e-4232-b2e4-9f8636f79d09.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138984,"FileName":"24fb8374-8140-4db9-8b1d-0978ac1f367e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138984,"FileName":"bdf41a33-0083-49ba-8514-fbca8498c655.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34700,"Name":"Guardic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Guardic (ガーディック Gādikku?) is a shoot 'em up video game for the MSX computer.

Flying across – or inside – a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.\n\nThe game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkeWijrZGKg","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133012,"FileName":"c1a541b4-66a5-4f94-8980-383722cd28d6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133012,"FileName":"4f538623-642a-4dfd-b424-8fec1cc58d16.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133012,"FileName":"e28407e1-a32d-4d35-82f1-0ac80acd5822.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133012,"FileName":"20a22ffd-e883-46da-a7ed-48aed2d2b98d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133012,"FileName":"d721aa56-f259-4a14-90ad-6d1021d4e80b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195295,"Name":"Gun.Smoke","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Unlicensed version of Gun Smoke for the MSX.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Prosoft","Publisher":"Prosoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195295,"FileName":"e25f2879-a583-4805-9b4f-46103c047907.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":195295,"FileName":"eb2b9f3d-b091-4479-883c-d5a6dace1c8e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195295,"FileName":"0eb869c9-45dc-42c4-a131-b90d3332078c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195295,"FileName":"40df2b47-afcd-483f-b58e-ae123c5e3df4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133013,"Name":"Gunfright","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"The player takes the part of the \"meanest and fastest Gun Totin'Bunch of Rootin' Tootin' Gun Slingers which ever did hit the Wild West\", Sheriff Quickdraw.

One Spanish programmer took it upon himself to port the title to the humble MSX1, and released it as part of the MSXdev'03 contest. However, he never asked the then-defunct Compile for permission.\n\nThe game uses the exact same rules and even the same puzzles as the GBA original, as well as the original sprites. The graphics make good use of the limited power of the MSX, with many colours, and even renders the player character using multicolour sprites. Due to the limitations in the number of sprites that may be displayed, only one duck is responsible for shooting the blocks that fill in the picture that is to be completed for each level (the GBA original uses two ducks). While the game replicates the original gameplay, it lacks the storyline and does not display a coloured version of the completed pictures, something which would not fit into the 32K of memory used by the game. Instead, Guru Logic for the MSX1 concentrates on the puzzle gameplay that is central to the game, giving a clear impression of what Guru Logic Champ might have looked like had it been conceived ten years earlier.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Karoshi","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166658,"FileName":"72af55eb-1373-494b-a407-7d90defc50e5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":166658,"FileName":"4dc5aaa1-7d90-4155-b8d2-9855c39be79e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166658,"FileName":"b29ecdbb-fc60-4333-aae3-5595286d5e16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153492,"Name":"Guttblaster","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Destroy all the evil and alien objects that you meet.

To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4syXpxxVCE","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"bdf1c1d1-5180-4402-84ad-ab60363ef609.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"32a43cf5-20c8-4a87-84ac-320af931ee08.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"36b0cf65-13cf-472c-9e28-2992157d92b1.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"e45fb60d-7523-432a-9ba5-e455f9f54a1e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"f7919169-ef72-4084-9620-90a6d10dca0a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"8d5ec725-ea34-4b24-8ecd-42926d5c14ed.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"81e450d3-b977-4265-9106-af8c9f018295.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"027448ec-f4ac-454d-ab89-03f2c6f03e92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139023,"FileName":"6a123560-45b7-4114-8288-a2f36cf0e177.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153493,"Name":"Habilit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Genesis Soft","Publisher":"MCM Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153493,"FileName":"112c7235-cbc2-46c8-af7e-c20e4b521383.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":153493,"FileName":"883b906c-8717-4a85-bebd-42878cf81098.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153493,"FileName":"1a741884-3325-4415-ba7f-8f52cbebaf4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":153493,"FileName":"5d14a559-fd8e-4917-9f17-7ba63dc9dec6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153494,"Name":"Hades","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sony","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153494,"FileName":"ddd586bf-75d3-4492-afde-52082d9fee68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":153494,"FileName":"1b7e1c15-1262-433a-a14c-24bf888e9216.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168376,"Name":"Hadesu no Monshou","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtjnhL28o-o","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Casio","Publisher":"Casio","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168376,"FileName":"0b0b9488-c7f2-4495-9646-b1e805ef8469.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168376,"FileName":"a56b78b1-09ed-4a20-b498-1c3aeeeb6198.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168376,"FileName":"045fe8e4-b83e-412b-a1f6-f7f287e8013d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168376,"FileName":"8241855b-0d31-493d-b127-6de0ccaffc09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168376,"FileName":"ed721d12-a31e-4473-b059-8155ee09c63f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168376,"AlternateName":"闇の竜王ハデスの紋章 ","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":111723,"Name":"Haja No Fuuin","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Demon queen Terarin has returned.

It is played with the hanafuda, which is a flower themed deck consisting of four cards in each of twelve suits corresponding to months of the year. The aim is to capture certain combinations, known as yaku, using cards played from the hand you are dealt, and picked up from the table.\n\nEach round starts with eight cards placed face up on the table, and eight dealt to each player. The first player must play a card to the table. If it matches the same suit as an existing table card, then both it and the played card are captured by that player. A new card is then drawn from the deck and immediately played to the table. Again, if this matches, the player captures that card, and it is then the opponent's move. The first player to make a yaku can choose to win the hand, or say \"Koi koi\" to continue the game. If a second yaku is completed before your opponent, you win double points. Otherwise, your opponent wins double points, and a new hand is dealt.\n\nIf no player completes a yaku when their cards run out, a point score is calculated from each player's captured cards and the player with the higher score wins the round and gains a point. The winner of the previous round then plays first in the next round. Play continues for 12 rounds (one for each month of the year), after which the player with the highest score wins.\n\nThis implementation of the game automatically detects when different yaku have been played, and does the scoring for you. It also has only one fairly low level of difficulty for the computer opponent, allowing a novice to win the game even if they imperfectly recognize the cards and can't remember all of the yaku.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"RAM Software","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180772,"FileName":"2dab966f-c751-41c0-87f6-cc274835bc10.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180772,"FileName":"bad9a625-a6e2-4452-8138-b1efa58b249e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180772,"FileName":"0e45ebf2-1e92-40f0-85c0-24c768a3aef5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180772,"FileName":"2179d4a8-55ed-4e53-8e5d-126bd7cfb986.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":180772,"AlternateName":"Hafanuda Koi Koi: Gostop Godori","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":153509,"Name":"Hang-On","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Hang-On is an arcade racing game, also bundled with the Master System and reminiscent of Pole Position, but with bikes.

As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers.

The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way.

The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"93e07980-47b7-46e6-ab80-b9fc256f45dd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"2d4e4c04-7ceb-4221-ab9b-0513945099bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"1c1a5444-0e0e-4c50-817a-edc3df86711d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"8e4137af-1739-4804-9015-4ed197ccc650.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"485f8547-bd2b-41c8-8a51-30bebef1f801.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"230db9e9-1b06-45e2-8892-41886ede7fda.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"49e6d13b-32b0-4257-81c3-5de6539a4bb7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"6ae39163-6822-4014-84e6-4e3fce43a592.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"91a792c2-361c-477a-9351-611d786ad43a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153716,"FileName":"900d4188-78f0-44ca-9017-1741befb03ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133018,"Name":"Hydlide 3: The Space Memories","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy.

The game is lost if the ring bearer is killed or corrupted by the ring's influence or if Sauron's forces capture the city of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe game takes place in three different views. The Middle Earth Map displays the whole of the land on one screen, with the player's armies highlighted (unlike the 16-bit versions, enemy armies cannot be seen until encountered). A more detailed view is available in the Campaign Map. This displays much more detail of the land, showing rivers, roads, forests, mountains, towns, et cetera. Units are displayed as shield icons, representing either individual characters or larger military formations.

It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart.

Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries.

The ball is sent to the front wall where it rebounds and one member of the opposite team has to catch it and send back to the front wall. The ball can rebound on the left and back wall, but there's no right wall as in other related Basque ball sports.

As you explore the 150-plus screens of the game, you must shoot the other fish - some can be shot using your standard weapon, while others (those which flash) must be shot using special limited bullets.\n\nYou also have responsibility for closing beaches, which removes the risk of a shark attack, but also costs the area business, especially on hot days, and irritates the Mayor.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1QPCbuFMF8","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Intelligent Design Ltd","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":139896,"FileName":"67afcc7d-3363-410d-b0d8-2742e60f1372.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":139896,"FileName":"fd2a21aa-08fa-4af9-acdd-8a2e317f5379.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":139896,"FileName":"0c7c9a84-9def-4119-a5c5-228fd7d75981.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":139896,"FileName":"ec990535-4d1d-4886-8e40-772dd96d6871.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139896,"FileName":"98ab390f-b406-49c2-ad32-bd917284bc9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139896,"FileName":"5b066531-afef-4273-bf5a-00ff7d1b38e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":139896,"AlternateName":"Tiburon","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":200253,"Name":"Je Compte!","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Educational game for small children.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":"Nice Ideas","Publisher":"Nice Ideas","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":200253,"FileName":"e35fe269-f173-4f6c-be08-9af1a89e004c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":200253,"FileName":"f2b36dc8-f695-40bc-8978-8dc28bcc0ff0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200253,"FileName":"af6ffeb8-d899-4f16-9822-2962e65e7bc9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200253,"FileName":"b2abdd24-b06c-4414-861c-718e370e65d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":139897,"Name":"Jet Bomber","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"A Zaxxon clone with Star Wars music and with speech.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k43pZ0S96lE","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"The Bytebusters","Publisher":"Aackosoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":139897,"FileName":"1182e04c-f09f-4dad-bffa-a95f6742b790.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":139897,"FileName":"b7e6d7f6-7626-4e5b-9c66-9a60e0c97d89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139897,"FileName":"45388825-85f5-4983-a0e7-51aedb11086b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200255,"Name":"Jet FIghter (Eurosoft)","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"This is a re-release of Jet Bomber.

Waves increase in difficulty, with every third or fourth wave being a formation wave where the aliens appear and attack in a particular pattern. Aliens mutate into more dangerous forms the longer they survive, so they should be killed as quickly as possible. The radar at the top of the screen shows what kinds of aliens are approaching and where they will appear. The aliens usually release white bombs these cannot be shot down, only avoided. They also release homing bombs, which are more dangerous but can be destroyed. Shooting the asteroid and capturing the \"mystery\" inside will stop the aliens from firing altogether for about 10 seconds, and give you bonus points for each alien you kill. You have 99 seconds to complete each wave. The quicker you complete the wave, the higher your bonus. An extra ship is awarded every 100,000 points. Using the warp button lets you escape from sticky situations. You have three warps for each wave, but warps do not accumulate from wave to wave.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtWAwiV1uNk","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"08c4fe0b-7a5b-4041-93f9-ef68b6baca65.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"6cc5207c-e76e-4974-990f-8adede42ba4a.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"af836aa2-b621-4fff-93a3-886de1ae4713.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"5c66aa66-fc88-468c-9350-36d2eecfd3b0.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"13f67416-9c23-45a5-afd7-a2a09dd87128.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"92570d8e-83ce-4f77-9401-b8dd86733966.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"b42acfda-fef7-4fc4-8df4-d6312ad9ad6c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"a4ce7fe4-e2f8-4ec1-8906-62df89688e30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"ff777fc5-f6dd-4ae7-af86-7fe4bddeef71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"6799c94a-3938-4a2d-89f3-f4e031659e17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":127405,"FileName":"f5ea73b9-5ba1-468a-988e-24cad4cd9c0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181411,"Name":"Jyan Friend","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Taito's mahjong simulator for the MSX.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181411,"FileName":"5f3f2e67-b802-4901-ade8-f7cf7f73033c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181411,"FileName":"34863a97-54b9-4065-96a5-85713a750cfa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181411,"FileName":"55ef70a7-cf93-4e57-bec8-9e6574768139.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181411,"FileName":"e38d956e-7078-4572-aaf1-251cbd39d15b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181411,"FileName":"beab668a-54c1-4003-a040-9aa00c6e0706.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":181411,"AlternateName":"Jan Friend","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":201545,"Name":"Jyankyo","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPefh5742OI","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201545,"FileName":"e02a32c0-4006-4a2f-94d5-b3ebfb55426c.jpg","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201545,"FileName":"70fd8936-1f1f-4fe7-b755-da33ae88b6e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201545,"FileName":"6617006b-761a-4bbe-851a-001953e8e803.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181946,"Name":"Jyanyuu","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181946,"FileName":"95359013-b141-4a8e-9281-02c849f4cdd7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181946,"FileName":"5944ed12-36f8-4c74-991a-03d7bcbb7436.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":181946,"AlternateName":"Janyuu, Janyu Mahjong","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":153898,"Name":"Kaeru Shooter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153898,"FileName":"f85ccce3-7591-4c82-9412-1b327a34d14d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":153898,"FileName":"a018de83-a9bd-4791-a653-5054f8ff6948.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153898,"FileName":"bb8f66a3-d4ae-40de-883d-aeab46039c9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133023,"Name":"Kage no Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord Yoshi.

Similar to the original version of the Portopia Serial Murder Case, the game was developed single handedly by Yuji Horii, including writing the game's scenario, designing, programming and even creating the ingame art. Enix published the title in May 1985 for the NEC PC-88 and ports for various Japanese computers followed shortly afterwards. A complete remake of Karuizawa Yuukai Annai was eventually released by Enix and later Square Enix for mobile phones in 2002. A second mobile remake was also created in 2005 that featured new artwork. The title has since been retroactively branded as part of a trilogy called Yuji Horii Mysteries which includes all the adventure games created by Yuji Horii.\n\nThe story follows a young collage student named Shiro who is visiting his girlfriend Kumiko while she is vacationing with her sister, Nagisa, at their villa in the town of Karuizawa. However, one day Nagisa does not return home and the couple suspects that she has been kidnapped after receiving a mysterious phone call. With the local police unable to to find Nagisa, Kumiko and the player begin exploring Karuizawa themselves to gather information in order to find out what happened to Nagisa.\n\nKaruizawa Yuukai Annai has the player visiting various places modeled after real-word locations in Karuizawa through an Ultima-style overworld map. Once the player arrives at a landmark, the perceptive changes to a first-person viewpoint where the player uses verb commands listed on the side of the screen to interact with the environment and talk to characters, similar to Yuji Horii's Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin. However, unlike the other adventure titles developed by Yuji Horii, Karuizawa Yuukai Annai has mild sexual content with the game featuring nudity and even commands for the player to \"kiss\" or \"hold\" certain characters.\n\nThe game is separated into six chapters and during the final chapter the gameplay changes to that of a basic western-style RPG where the player engages in battles on the overworld map. In this section the player has a party of three characters (Shiro, Kumiko and Nagisa's friend named Asami) who can increase their states by winning battles and find items in treasure chests to use in battle. During battles the player can select various commands to attack enemies, including humorous actions such as a female party member flashing their underwear to weaken an enemy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD3RTjsJvqY&ab_channel=%E3%83%92%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E5%90%9B","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Yuji Horii","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133024,"FileName":"b5d33b46-a5c9-4e8e-82d1-19d44382c541.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133024,"FileName":"413a42ae-27a8-44d3-9103-a6e4d2c756e3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133024,"FileName":"85d71586-99cc-4c36-8795-42d25dd50ae2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133024,"FileName":"42466c15-6e51-4001-9e73-2bed7bd04856.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133024,"FileName":"4c310ffa-34ac-4fe3-8707-99328836a37a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":133024,"AlternateName":"The Karuizawa Kidnapping Guidance","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":153900,"Name":"Katmosis Faraon","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"J.Mateos","Publisher":"ABC Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153900,"FileName":"58277a5d-fb35-4b24-b7fd-b50cdd5f31fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":153900,"FileName":"60f4abce-2f8d-40d5-8edb-745c4675fd90.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141339,"Name":"Ke Rulen los Petas","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"In a dystopian future in Bangkok, drug addicts Mikel Jakson and Andrés Kasho Mulo fight against the corrupt dictatorship of the evil General Charoen.\nA very great Spanish language adventure that perhaps did not have an overwhelming success it should have.

You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level.

The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diq7K-IH47s","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1985-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"62603f8e-db46-4c4c-97e3-9f96f2cbb4ff.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"2cd147cc-2abe-40a5-b2ba-558de9b1bf3f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"af8a6e10-8cb2-456d-9b28-605aa8cc4959.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"ec0fb140-e19f-4326-b7e4-72687e0a47cb.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"d60428a3-b64d-4ff9-8c01-0000213d5bfb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"affab59e-3980-479a-aa60-6a2b34589d50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26993,"FileName":"89c0593c-7efb-4397-ab07-7765bcd90fb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153966,"Name":"Konami's Pooyan","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.\n\nThe first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.\n\nThe wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1fsds0TDU0","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami Industry Co.

The graphics were made by Juan Delcán.\nThis game is a videoadventure with 3D isometric graphics, where a Franciscan friar, William of Occam (William of Baskerville in the book) and his young novice Adso have to discover the perpetrator of a series of murders in a medieval Italian abbey.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRHqZYGvzJA","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Opera Soft","Publisher":"Opera Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":93926,"FileName":"54cce16e-56ce-419f-9ff5-b06e4a3e513f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":93926,"FileName":"7a1ff8c8-4383-4956-9b19-89d4f7615b88.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93926,"FileName":"2060ad66-1d70-4671-ae3e-e10dc814cfb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":93926,"FileName":"0f384870-4532-4541-855d-37a1482f6a6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93926,"AlternateName":"Abadia del Crimen, La","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93926,"AlternateName":"Abadia del Crimen, La","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":185897,"Name":"La Armada Contraataca","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Game included in the Soft MSX #4 compilation.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Heliodoro Gallego","Publisher":"Editorial Cometa","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185897,"FileName":"f27c3afb-1245-4141-912c-e468c58ab2c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185897,"FileName":"53e500e2-fd26-4d02-b2d0-4f05ae2ea13e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153960,"Name":"La Aventura Espacial","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"A supercomputer in the most remote part of a distant galaxy has become crazy and threatens to destroy the planet.

It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first \"martyrs\"; several important programmers were fired after becoming \"addicted\" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.\n\nIn the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called \"La Aventura Original\" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.\n\nThis version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, \"ñ\"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Aventuras AD","Publisher":"Aventuras AD","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95658,"FileName":"aed661bd-ebf3-4a3d-9841-887bd0db7b23.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95658,"FileName":"5b309a9a-06d3-4172-a011-d256570e27e8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95658,"FileName":"03a7a3b7-e73f-448c-8283-745f75a0488b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95658,"FileName":"b36b317f-85ee-437c-a443-08627bcabd59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95658,"FileName":"9c77de7d-8fbc-4521-adfc-20b32ffbbfb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185081,"Name":"La Battaglia delle Ardenne","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Philips Italy","Publisher":"Philips Italy","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185081,"FileName":"75bc3868-28fc-4711-8ebe-9246d2d5c30b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185081,"FileName":"27aa4273-fa82-4568-b9f5-c37c6daec92f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180871,"Name":"La Corona Encantada","ReleaseYear":"2009","Overview":"“Stories are told about the kings of the ancient country of Hyoth always wearing an enchanted crown crown that gave them the power to reign.”\n\n“Once upon a time, the perfidious Royal Advisor, driven by his greed, instructed one of his henchmen to steal the crown.

This means that a lot of advance route-planning is required, although most creatures can be killed by landing on their heads (horizontal contact with them is however fatal). The tarantulas are perhaps the deadliest foe, as they move so quickly.

There are obstacles in the road that you must avoid, either by going to the left or right or by jumping over them. Unlike Trailblazer, you can jump a whole lot, even to the point of virtually flying above the level. Not even then are you safe, though, since airplanes will attack you in the sky.\n\nThe ground has holes in it. If you miscalculate a leap, and fall into a black hole, you are dropped into something very much like Tempest, with your sphere moving across the outer edge of a space tunnel, shooting at the things that come out of it.

The terror had seized the inhabitants of \"Cococastle\", and only Mad can give back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants of this village.\n\nThe game consists in eating all the \"coconuts\" (small ball species that are dispersed through all the Castle) which appear at every moment.

Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode. As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation. When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game.

Of course, no amount of training will be enough for some old snoggers so they can be sold and new players bought via the transfer system. Matches are viewed from side-on view. Both United and the opposition can be player or computer-controlled. Players dribble automatically and shoot when the fire button is released - the strength of kick determined by the time fire was held down. In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick. In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX. Gameplay is not that great since it is frustratingly difficult to score goals. Man Utd fans will enjoy the almost forgotten experience of winning the league.

The player does not directly interact with the suspects, he only gets to read their statement. During the course of the game he also finds a decoder which can be used to decrypt messages. Puzzles consist of finding code words.\n\nThis part has no defined ending. When the player has puzzled together the solution - he also needs to use the many documents which are delivered with the game in physical form - he starts the second part of the game. Here he needs to answer a series of questions and, if they are correct, he wins.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cobra Soft","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188918,"FileName":"e1b29f50-a7a1-4df5-96f2-6a1831d71abf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":188918,"FileName":"351d889d-4794-480f-a69e-5286b0817380.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":188918,"FileName":"fe631b94-decd-416b-9c23-855ccb9f8f2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":188918,"FileName":"b88e2282-76b0-4992-8142-462e56a7e8a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":147854,"Name":"Michael Jackson: Moonwalker","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Moonwalker is broken up into 4 levels.

She can shoot webs to stun any monster (except Godzilla and Hedorah). Mothra can walk north, south, west and east, but the screen locks after going up so Mothra cannot go to places that went offscreen. Mothra can only survive 5 hits of minimal damage, and there are only three lives. However, there are hidden power-ups that restore health that need to be shot with web to be revealed and become obtainable. It is possible to get extra lives by scoring 30,000 points.\n\nAfter 5 hits, all monsters die. All monsters also die if they hit Mothra, and this results in her obtaining some damage. There is an enemy volcano which shoots boulders and cannot be harmed.\n\nIt is recommended to play the game at a slow pace as having many monsters at the screen at the same time can make the game very hard. At the end of a section, there are three gates. You do not need to kill all enemies and you can choose any gate to proceed to the second section of the first level. However, on the second section of the first level, you need to pick the gate to the far right to get to level two. From the second level onwards the game will repeat, but the enemies and power-ups will change locations. The ultimate goal of the game is to get a higher high score.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3RniyRmqe8&list=PLxeKpvvjBRxz450nHbtqat0BW_dgI5d23&index=126&ab_channel=MSXWiki","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Zap","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154369,"FileName":"37fe5db7-eae5-4796-8a86-07ecfade9f47.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154369,"FileName":"27422d18-17eb-4a5f-bf56-94e59d3cb976.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":154369,"FileName":"975fb248-b27e-46e4-ad78-a111ab3a9f11.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154369,"FileName":"bc6c75b2-90b1-4b4d-89f8-018ca29ca9ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154369,"FileName":"673e6584-99b4-4714-9b8c-d939006b1c58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":154369,"FileName":"cb6692ff-d273-424b-b0c2-d3c83fdb6ea4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154370,"Name":"Midnight Building","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Midnight Building you control a man who is running around in a dark labyrinth.

Assisting you is your bodyguard/minder Terry McCann, while the policeman Sgt. Chisholm is ready to fine you if he catches you with stolen goods.\n\nYou start the game with two thousand pounds and some inventory in your storage locker. Some of the goods may have already been promised to someone, and just need to be delivered. Other goods are expected, but have yet to be collected from the supplier. Goods can be bought and sold by visiting individual sellers, or the Winchester pub where a variety of wheeler-dealer types hang out. Each character present at the time is represented graphically in the top half of the screen and is associated with a number. By pressing that number (quickly, as there is a time limit) you can initiate conversation with that character. If you fail to select a character before the time limit, a random character may start speaking with you. All dialogue involves buying items from them (using text commands like \"I WANT\", \"HOW MUCH\", \"OFFER\") or selling items to them.\n\nOnce a deal has been agreed, the goods need to be moved. Your minder, Terry McCann can assist with this, and can be found at the Winchester, or in his flat (although he will tend to be uncooperative after working hours). He can be asked to collect or deliver items. If you are meeting with a dealer who might be upset with you because you have sold them poor quality merchandise, you can ask Terry to \"MINDER\" and he will accompany you to prevent violence (to you). Terry can also \"DUMP\" goods if they are stolen and you have the law breathing down your neck, so need to just get rid of them. You can tell goods are stolen because you will be questioned about them at odd times by Sgt. Chisholm. If he catches you with the goods at the storage locker, you will need to pay a hefty fine.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"dk'tronics","Publisher":"dk'tronics","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154372,"FileName":"5536f0c0-089c-4224-b5ab-e1b998b61649.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":154372,"FileName":"ab7a2674-c464-442b-b8a1-d0f0f75c769c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":154372,"FileName":"f54ffb27-b364-4afc-a666-67f5a89091d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154372,"FileName":"4f6ecdb6-442d-4cef-9627-ecc1f749572d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":154372,"FileName":"a85ad31e-cfe5-451d-8d59-c8e79401efaf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154373,"Name":"Miner Machine","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Boss Company","Publisher":"System 4","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154373,"FileName":"c6b3fca4-6bc2-4a6a-9320-f62c857361a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":154373,"FileName":"986aa2c0-8b83-4e49-ad0c-abe60ca51a39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":154373,"FileName":"5146853a-9ca8-4d3b-b1aa-a9996ac15609.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154398,"Name":"Mini Golf","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1984-04-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":154398,"FileName":"85f33b92-9980-4c7b-9ffa-d655515ab0d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":154398,"FileName":"0539fac2-b9c8-4e5b-a7a1-9cf77ce19238.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154398,"FileName":"78ac2d53-07a0-4f20-8e50-f26270aff0ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154398,"FileName":"244bdb6b-fd26-4e96-a1d6-df6d295880eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128061,"Name":"Mini-Golf","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"James Ralph Pty LTd","Publisher":"Spectravideo","ReleaseDate":"1984-04-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128061,"FileName":"b0c49e21-238d-4b72-82f2-73cdebaa892c.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128061,"FileName":"ed6351b9-93d8-45ad-8269-0ba47c0af773.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128061,"FileName":"a2d7e514-3aa9-4953-921b-f0a459de701b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":128061,"FileName":"c1e49b2f-ec0a-4d47-97aa-4d05d51f9eb3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128061,"FileName":"429d69d8-90af-4b1e-80b0-c3d25aa7fc9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128061,"FileName":"cdd70681-4f0d-4cac-b6d6-d2a42c6bc10a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154374,"Name":"Mirai","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The year is 720 of the Galactic Era.

She can shoot webs to stun any monster (except Godzilla and Hedorah). Mothra can walk north, south, west and east, but the screen locks after going up so Mothra cannot go to places that went offscreen. Mothra can only survive 5 hits of minimal damage, and there are only three lives. However, there are hidden power-ups that restore health that need to be shot with web to be revealed and become obtainable. It is possible to get extra lives by scoring 30,000 points.\n\nAfter 5 hits, all monsters die. All monsters also die if they hit Mothra, and this results in her obtaining some damage. There is an enemy volcano which shoots boulders and cannot be harmed.\n\nIt is recommended to play the game at a slow pace as having many monsters at the screen at the same time can make the game very hard. At the end of a section, there are three gates. You do not need to kill all enemies and you can choose any gate to proceed to the second section of the first level. However, on the second section of the first level, you need to pick the gate to the far right to get to level two. From the second level onwards the game will repeat, but the enemies and power-ups will change locations.

An unappreciative critic tries to thwart Mr.Chin by throwing cutlery at him from off-stage which he must avoid by either jumping or ducking. The frequency at which these objects are thrown increases for later stages. From stage 4, gaps in the floor appear and move about which will cause the circus star to fall. From stage 10, the levels wrap back to the beginning.\n\nTo set a dish spinning, Mr. Chin must first collect a dish from the side of the screen which he carries this on his head.

On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.\n\nIn each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.\n\nAs the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a \"boss\". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.\n\nItems can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized. Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.\n\nThe items in this game are:\n\n    Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.\n\n    Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!\n\n    Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.\n\n    Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.\n\n    Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.\n    Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!\n\n    Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.\n\n    Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nippon Dexter","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154738,"FileName":"9b50490b-a136-46ee-be80-3b5d3b05da16.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154738,"FileName":"1d130c4d-d17b-45f7-88bb-92aef2a5dd7d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":154738,"FileName":"0cec3879-736b-49af-92b1-196419134237.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154738,"FileName":"5c813214-2bd8-4496-a0b7-c300cf10c314.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154738,"FileName":"6fe08621-4112-4397-a303-0972c5f012a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":154738,"FileName":"1cb3b585-7b6a-41a9-8a1d-1633ba7b00e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154740,"Name":"Ninja Kun","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Ninja-kun is a simple game featuring a ninja, plenty of treasures and patrolling guards.

Young aspiring Knights of His Majesty were selected in all the regions and towns, among those who excelled in the handling of the bow, the fight to body or the sword. However, the hardest of the sacrifices was reserved for only a select few. One by one they were subjected to the final rite, the rite of the Castle without a name.

The player has to protect the Golden Viking Helmet, which is at the bottom of the screen, from the attack of five different kinds of enemies. Each wave of enemies is composed of 5 of them. The enemies will appear in the top of the screen and will move toward the bottom of the screen; they can only move down (or diagonally down), and once they reach the bottom or the side of the screen they will reappear on the top or the opposite side. The Viking can move in all six directions, and will also reappear on the opposite side whenever he reaches the border. In order to attack, the Viking has to move inside the hexagon the enemy is in before the enemy moves against him first. As the enemies can only move downwards, approaching them from the 3 upper sides is advised.\n\nWhen an enemy dies, the corpse remains in the hexagon, making it impossible to move through it. Well placed corpses can function as a trap for other enemies, as they can only move downwards. The player can also get trapped by surrounding corpses. Once all 5 enemies are dead, a new wave of enemies comes. Each new wave has different enemies, in the following order: giants, octopuses, dragons, skeletons and bats. Once all waves are beaten, the game restarts from the first wave in a greater difficulty, while retaining the player's score. If the player dies or the Golden Viking Helmet is stolen, the game is over.\n\nThe game has 10 variations:\n\n    Game 0: 1 helmet, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\n    Game 1: 2 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\n    Game 2: 3 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\n    Game 3: Same as game 0, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\n    Game 4: As game 1, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\n    Game 5: As game 2, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\n    Game 6: 1 helmet, monsters will come from all directions: two monsters moving from top to bottom, and one each from left to right, from right to left and from the bottom to the top.

The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens.

These are split into three groups which are Kids Stuff, Smart Alec and Mensa Only and each level is harder than the last one but with a higher time limit.

With your brush you slide the pieces of the poster by a full row or a full column so forward planning is required. In the bottom right corner is a sign for the toilet and if you press down you can see what the poster should look like, a press of the fire button shows the poster with the grid on it and finally another press of the fire button and you see what the poster is looking like at that moment.

You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. \n\nAt the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.\n\nFinally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.\n\nThe game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155108,"FileName":"5af85b55-4117-464d-b1aa-f95738ab2f56.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155108,"FileName":"daef6db8-5de5-4cc8-99a5-d652016ca339.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":155108,"FileName":"10ff6a9d-e270-4157-b961-514e21d731c3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":155108,"FileName":"9c7c862d-9351-4a49-b3a4-94e780ba1186.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155108,"FileName":"c94dcb79-cd93-4b73-99ec-0f3c03fc0b65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155212,"Name":"Payload","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"In this driving game you control a freelance Japanese lorry driver.

This is a loose collection of bricks that can be shifted by pushing them or firing into them. Suck spiders start invading from the edge of your property, and you must shoot them before they shoot you. The spider's dead bodies can provide extra material for your house. After the first wave of 30 spiders has been killed, your bride arrives, and you receive bonus points for the size of your house. The next wave of spiders then arrives, but now you must also protect your wife. This can be done by surrounding her with bricks, dead spiders, and \"stoppers\" which you can drop in an empty space in front of you. If you or your wife get shot, you lose a life. After every 30 spiders killed, you receive a bonus, as well as a small amount of time to prepare for the next wave.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K98AO04LV4","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Microcabin","Publisher":"Microcabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155229,"FileName":"994766ad-218d-4afc-a7bb-fb11ec7ae1d2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155229,"FileName":"62cd6524-9aac-46e1-9423-ca63827ffb19.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":155229,"FileName":"18fed847-cabf-4a65-87e6-2c24c7d82da1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":155229,"FileName":"27b20e33-e78e-4fbc-8289-a47edea6c1c4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155229,"FileName":"cef9585b-4273-43da-ba33-08f18422cf4c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155230,"Name":"Picture Puzzle","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Picture Puzzle is a puzzle game.

Along the way, he must negotiate numerous hazards, including pits, quicksand, rolling logs, fire, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and crocodiles. Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on vines. Treasure includes bags of money, gold and silver bars, and diamond rings, which range in value from 2000 to 5000 points in 1000 point increments. There are eight of each treasure type, with 32 in total. A perfect score of 114,000 is achieved by claiming all 32 treasures without losing any points. Points are deducted by either falling in a hole (100 points) or touching logs; point loss depends on how long contact is made with the log. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various points. Traveling though the tunnel moves forward three screens at a time, which is necessary in order to collect all the treasures within the time limit. However, the tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player to return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again, thus wasting time. The tunnels also contain scorpions. The player loses a life if Harry comes in contact with any obstacle (except logs) or falls into a tar pit, quicksand, waterhole, or mouth of a crocodile. The game ends when either all 32 treasures have been collected, all three lives have been lost, or the time has run out.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqh49op5Hl4","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"ebbe8e8b-3f93-4eb0-a82d-56b8f6097afb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"94339806-48b1-4c81-9206-2a6db4144a1f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"34ded636-a71f-43ea-920a-95323e67c82e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"dbf9209d-bd3f-4a71-bab3-fdc7d3940716.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"d81ff201-76a7-48d8-8469-89e02aa20284.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"4fbe1886-0e96-40ba-9bb1-7241097009b0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"050f9311-7fbc-4a44-b344-089fce602900.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"8284fc09-e3d2-476f-a783-cd254b9a05ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":126823,"FileName":"ace0eb47-b2a9-462d-93d4-5ee0f7b7c0a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":126823,"AlternateName":"Pitfall","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":155253,"Name":"Pitman 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hebdogiciel Magazine","Publisher":"Hebdogiciel Magazine","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155253,"FileName":"be1c3556-58e5-4e2c-8fa1-c5cfb461206f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":155253,"FileName":"efce908e-9bb7-4fa4-b733-92cdde73638f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":155253,"FileName":"5553643c-05bb-4c2e-b6f7-6c7da00c0327.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27027,"Name":"Play Ball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The thrill of baseball!

Each level consists of two stages. The first stage is to guide your craft along the surface of the planet towards the enemy fortress, avoiding attacks by UFOs from the front and rear. You can shoot forwards during this stage to destroy your enemies. As you approach, the fortress slowly appears on the horizon. Once it has been reached, the second stage starts. The goal of this stage is to power up a missile, and launch it at a small moving white bay-door which is the vulnerable point of the fortress. While powering up, which takes about 30 seconds, the craft is unable to fire its other weapons and must dodge all enemies and their incoming fire. If you miss the bay door with the missile, the next missile is powered up. The process is repeated until either you or the fortress are destroyed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Microcabin","Publisher":"Microcabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155288,"FileName":"7e407915-ccf8-4011-9f41-ff1737e8afb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155288,"FileName":"ff24c242-c9d8-45df-b8a5-363ef765cceb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155288,"FileName":"36a01ecf-d4fb-4804-85c5-b1603a16d093.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155289,"Name":"Poli Diaz","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Poli Diaz is a boxing game protagonized by the Spanish boxing star of the late eighties, Policarpio Díaz.

You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mr. Micro","Publisher":"Mr. Micro","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155309,"FileName":"73bd9118-5ee6-4dbb-b13c-55c77b5b0a91.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155309,"FileName":"be081268-b4a8-4150-809a-e7eb10837e9f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155309,"FileName":"b4f28c62-be6c-4fdc-b6fe-bb2ae64b3d7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155309,"FileName":"d1b5847c-6e97-4ec8-9af7-ad0cf26c4019.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155312,"Name":"Puzzle Panic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Puzzle Panic is a 1984 puzzle game created by Ken Uston in collaboration with designers Ron Karr, Bob Polin, and Paul Wernick. Ken Uston was better known as a blackjack player and strategist, but he was also a video game author and the creator of Puzzle Panic. The game was originally released on the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in 1984, but later received an MSX port in 1986 by SystemSoft.\n\nPuzzle Panic is more of a minigame compilation than a defined puzzle game. There are eleven different \"levels\" that can be played, each of which is somehow a pattern based short puzzle game. These range from collecting certain items in a specific order, to reaching a set point under certain conditions.\n\nThe player begins the game in a room filled with question marks. There are two doors available, and walking into each one teleports the player to a new game (while the other brings the player to a new room, with two different doors; essentially a hub world). Within these games, there are several modes of difficulty to play through (accessed through three different doors within each game) before moving onto a different screen. All of the games can be accessed at anytime by bringing up the menu (by pressing F2).\n\nWhen the games are played in order rather than by the menu selection, they are (in reality) part of a larger puzzle, where each puzzle is actually represented by its own symbol, and interaction with the gates at the end of each is integral. In fact, the final puzzle requires the player to select the symbol that represents each level, as well as the order they were played in sequence. The final puzzle was known as \"Metasequence,\" Ken Uston's \"ultimate challenge.\" This larger puzzle was originally intended to be part of a real life contest, where players who managed to complete the puzzle in time (by August 31, 1984) won a trip to Atlantic City with Ken Uston.(Giant Bomb)","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"Computer War System Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155312,"FileName":"89b6d1bf-def6-4e27-9016-8a35b4b54450.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155312,"FileName":"3ba83d26-d581-482c-ae09-2923ffadaede.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155312,"FileName":"7f323c2a-da60-4d2f-ab84-88aad8d0344a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155312,"FileName":"1cf42ca7-0ef6-42ee-b27c-1f8a2cdb0bef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155312,"FileName":"9aa96b2e-fc8c-4bf5-9ea8-4e4abf49f1a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155313,"Name":"Pyramid Warp","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1f0uNESENQ&ab_channel=FunCade64","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"T&E Soft","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155313,"FileName":"57b81590-b687-49cd-9654-d03f8fc33503.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155313,"FileName":"9ad663ac-bc4f-403a-bec8-e7dc9d62e6ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155313,"FileName":"586cd741-38c2-4852-a11a-16f3a8fc7af3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155313,"FileName":"0c5dcb59-ac36-4c37-934e-5bf4ef862631.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155313,"FileName":"fc483911-9155-44a0-83ec-f9116e7b4f8d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203974,"Name":"Pyramid Warp Enhanced+","ReleaseYear":"2021","Overview":"An upgrade of the original Pyramid Warp game which includes new graphics, new music and smoother gameplay.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"theNestruo","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":203974,"FileName":"99a70c93-1de5-4d37-b048-f81ba060555f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":203974,"FileName":"e5c85a13-d546-4c6e-94bc-3be6f19b8179.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203974,"FileName":"a0e35268-41d3-4907-8024-8beab257b95c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":203974,"FileName":"abfe04fb-6bb1-4e7f-892f-f08dd264d063.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155314,"Name":"Pyro-Man","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nice Ideas","Publisher":"Nice Ideas","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155314,"FileName":"d1df9e4f-decf-4519-b0a5-27936b3efe03.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":155314,"FileName":"4f7f0edb-846f-4642-a7bb-4bb4d56f5a86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":155314,"FileName":"8a79813d-b3ce-44db-9fe1-91d05be2d870.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33846,"Name":"Qbert","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Despite it's name, this Q*Bert installment is not a port of the first game, rather it's based on Q*Bert's Qubes.

Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.\n\nIn the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building.

After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. (\"giant-looking depredators\"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home.\n\nRescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads. In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun. The protagonist can also be ejected from the bathysphere in order to explore more strait entrances. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia: a jetpack to reach higher places; a portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis; a first-aid kit that can only be used once; and a mould to fabricate gold bars.There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat).\n\nThe player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level; once empty, the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them.\n\nIn the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures.\n\nThe final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset.\n\nThe game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Dinamic","Publisher":"Dinamic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155225,"FileName":"805f0820-5ae6-414a-a891-74cf839515db.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155225,"FileName":"d2177e2b-f21f-4de2-9ac9-451a764e0837.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":155225,"FileName":"53291ad1-cf92-46a8-be15-25b6c2f937bc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155225,"FileName":"b21b817d-920b-4adc-88c2-71dc0ff1bd13.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":155225,"FileName":"9ba817d4-6b86-4c8d-a950-fce8055f4209.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155225,"FileName":"0c86f736-6f30-43cf-88d5-d121d51acc57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":155225,"AlternateName":"Rescue from Atlantis","Region":"United Kingdom"}]},{"DatabaseID":155226,"Name":"Rescate en el Golfo","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"The game is a classic beat-'em-up.\n\nA Jumbo jet full of passengers is hijacked by Iraqi terrorists and they are threatening to blow the plane up.\n\nOne of the passengers happens to be the girl friend of Ricky.

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...\n\nOcean's version of RoboCop for 8-bit machines loosely adapts the Data East arcade game, with stages inspired by those from the coin-op, but also entirely new gameplay elements.\n\nIn most levels, RoboCop walks from left to right, shooting his gun at hordes of enemies that intend to kill him with bullets, chainsaws or their fists. Stages include the streets of Detroit (in two parts, based on the first level of the arcade), a drug factory (based on the fourth arcade level), and a junkyard (based on the third coin-op stage). Gun power-ups to collect include a rapid fire model, a three-way shot and a powerful flame cannon. Two levels end with boss fights against RoboCop's chief adversary ED-209. For some reason, ED is impervious to bullets and must be defeated using Robo's fists alone.\n\nNew challenges from the arcade include hostage scenarios: in these, seen from a first-person perspective, a criminal holds an innocent person. Moving crosshairs and firing precisely, RoboCop must take care to shoot only the criminal, not the civilian.\n\nAnother new game element requires some quick thinking: in a puzzle mode, a composite sketch of a suspect is presented and must be matched by choosing the correct parts (hair, chin, eyes, etc.) of the face within a tight time limit.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Ocean","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155283,"FileName":"06df83de-e7b6-4ca8-ba53-d0b182caf1b7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":155283,"FileName":"ffd3c60a-f0d1-4070-b825-e2512ca0bc2b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":155283,"FileName":"515f5642-2ffa-4cde-99f6-0afa4c876415.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":155283,"FileName":"93597294-1c92-4467-bbbc-c9665ff9194e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":155283,"FileName":"78c374c6-ad69-45a4-855f-fb6c42c15bb1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155283,"FileName":"8e64a25d-a370-442d-9a81-0fe31af9da12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155423,"Name":"Robofrog","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mass Tael","Publisher":"Mass Tael","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155423,"FileName":"a53c7d6f-767d-43ab-a96d-85054c37bfc2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155423,"FileName":"086a5b11-52e3-4ddf-8703-0a5ec5294f9f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155423,"FileName":"66c2f980-eedb-4a8f-ac04-87b24e54ce71.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155423,"FileName":"431c690b-a7e6-49de-bcec-b6b1501d0205.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155423,"FileName":"0299a7f5-30b6-4330-b34e-c5b1541979c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155436,"Name":"Robot Wars","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"The player controls a human that battles with enemy robots that pursue and attack in maze like constructed levels.

However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1986-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34039,"FileName":"9deb1220-874e-4213-b64b-ab942bbcffed.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34039,"FileName":"d777defc-5aae-44b0-a07b-c80d606e0f3c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34039,"FileName":"d23cf2c6-0fef-4250-932d-0ce3eee3dc22.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34039,"FileName":"65c4d663-85f5-464d-94ef-3aca9f7006c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34039,"FileName":"6259c475-316f-4afd-ab2d-262e66283c19.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34039,"FileName":"4f11c7a5-8357-48b3-ba23-977f7120236c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":34039,"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer Jr.: Romancia","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":155148,"Name":"Rotors","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155148,"FileName":"1b54afa8-e291-465c-86bf-e36e1557478a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155148,"FileName":"b73733f3-a615-48b9-8483-4d5856e5d4dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155148,"FileName":"0e2bcadc-4eaa-458d-8e6e-6f20bb4f4218.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155148,"FileName":"4f950b79-a138-4ed6-9e8d-4514590618b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128024,"Name":"R-Type","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"R-Type is a side scrolling shoot-em-up arcade game produced by Irem in 1987.

You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. \n\nThe twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6Psxkj7oJA","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Mass Tael Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155301,"FileName":"b9ab5b4d-557e-4ead-991b-3fea1e6ddb91.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155301,"FileName":"e88a96cc-aae2-4f81-b279-6c268e4fc36a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155301,"FileName":"22f8666f-4816-458d-8af7-bc962d37c378.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":155301,"FileName":"98d9aa2d-95a0-42c7-b5ef-316e3a02b59d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155301,"FileName":"017d7531-55f9-4d31-acf1-037a32225dab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155301,"FileName":"c910655a-75c1-4e47-948e-7e1353b63995.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155302,"Name":"Satan","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Three magic scrolls must be found in the first part of the scrolling hack 'n' slash game, before you can make the journey to defeat your foes and rescue the other wizards in the second part.

The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.\n\nThe fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the player gets eaten by a shark.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Electric Software Limited","Publisher":"Electric Software Limited","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188931,"FileName":"267c830e-ceaf-4648-918f-ee9749fa2756.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188931,"FileName":"60e2c37f-2c30-4926-aeb0-9b6baa3cae4a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188931,"FileName":"41b790bc-9500-435f-8349-a95c5113066b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188931,"FileName":"7a1471ec-607c-4b15-9395-1356c7bf800e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190557,"Name":"Shater Hassan","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":"Barq","Publisher":"Barq","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190557,"FileName":"0a53c775-75fa-43b3-b124-efca55bdfc3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190557,"FileName":"ecb1432b-7993-410b-9469-dc93af1daa0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190559,"Name":"Shater Hassan (Al Alamiah)","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":"Al Alamiah","Publisher":"Al Alamiah","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190559,"FileName":"638d2b37-2a67-4775-9360-6a8b1c89f527.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":190559,"FileName":"a264b953-bc78-4d6a-a4a5-5b07739de2e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190559,"FileName":"0e5be09a-3223-4e72-a7a0-7496e8303d68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168380,"Name":"Shindobaddo Nanatsu no Bouken","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE4O7gb8jIA","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Casio","Publisher":"Casio","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168380,"FileName":"59bb2e81-c1f2-4243-a615-d597c39144b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168380,"FileName":"3238b379-ed0b-492a-a3ab-915a31175f8c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168380,"FileName":"50d332f4-c767-4ed6-89b9-fda47c8f3892.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168380,"FileName":"4d436beb-a78d-425d-9c7c-0f272fc1d295.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168380,"FileName":"d751291f-6f03-463a-aff6-513b0b2bf991.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168380,"FileName":"f130d8c8-2935-4c64-831c-efe5e1d69fcc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168380,"AlternateName":"The Seven Adventures of Sindbad","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168380,"AlternateName":"シンドバッド７つの冒険","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168380,"AlternateName":"Alla II","Region":"Korea"}]},{"DatabaseID":155355,"Name":"Shinobi","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"You control a shinobi, Joe Musashi, who must battle his way through each level in search of hostages which must be rescued.

Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your \"flight record\", which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward.\n\nWhen you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAiSVL5QcAs","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"ac65591a-37c4-4d2b-b695-9f0ab9844150.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"3d1f990b-f2db-41d1-96fe-4bae03acf8a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"7e9cbfec-a60d-498c-9d97-b239aaa86a6e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"b7aae8dc-7dfd-4bde-aca4-0083cc61a662.jpg","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"8a05e292-15e2-4199-b2c1-b8c0274bebef.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"5a559775-464e-4083-ba56-602d05108fcc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"93113d2c-9a51-407b-9dcd-61881bd9cfa4.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"cdb020c1-a6e6-4d37-b43a-05e4988cee9c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"ca82cb9e-49d0-48f6-9166-bc6c7624ce39.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"1a603012-5e0e-48b2-a58b-3d5757a25090.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"3b196890-8a77-404b-bea9-8a30033f31ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168575,"FileName":"fc208742-ea6d-43d4-8214-031ff082962b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168575,"AlternateName":"スペーストラブル","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":173826,"Name":"Space Walk","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Battle your way across the lunar surface then user your powerful Jet-pack to thrust you up to the rotating satellite.

One would expect half of Super Mario Bros 3 cloned, but only Mario's sprite and few others are ripped from that game. Everything else is redrawn, though mostly stolen from  Super Mario World. This makes for some awkward elements, like diagonal pipes realized as stairs.\n\n The game consists of 16 levels, which equals the number in both previous Super Boy games, but this time, they're entirely new. At the end of every level awaits a Hammer Brother, the final boss is the fat one from SMB3. Mario's(?) walking speed is extraordinarily slow, but even running he's not really fast. Extras are limited to those that are in since the first game. Quite everything looks like how the next Super Mario game would have turned out if Miyamoto wouldn't have had any more ideas. Seeing how almost everything in the game is newly pixeled, one cannot help but wonder why they didn't just create their own characters to begin with. Was the developer really so unimaginative? Other games by Zemina like Cyborg Z suggest differently.\n\n In other news, the hero of the series finally gets to rescue his first princess in the short ending","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhxeVPEouJY","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Zemina","Publisher":"Zemina","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"0845cd16-094b-4bb4-8e70-a08865248b8a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"480a3da8-eb34-4703-920e-0ea754e170a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"0abd5c73-cdb9-44b3-9b01-577aea98c1a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"8be6ef60-2574-441e-b0ea-343e6b291ff0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"6094ea2c-ca9e-4073-94ec-e4d67bb10723.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"b1453dc7-a8f8-489b-8867-87f924d19de5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168591,"FileName":"d800e601-7fe3-4c4b-8a96-98da789ec1cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168591,"AlternateName":"수퍼보이 III","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":182869,"Name":"Super Boy I","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Super Boy is a Super Mario Bros. clone. The gameplay is designed very similarly to the original game. The physics, however, are poorly programmed in comparison, and the items in the ? Blocks are completely random. Due to the older hardware, the scrolling is different to Super Mario Bros.. The scrolling moves in a very choppy fashion (Most, if not all MSX1 games had scrolling like this). The fireballs travel differently as compared with the ones from Super Mario Bros., and the Koopas also die in one hit which means that you can't kick their shells afterwards. Most of the time the area with the HUD can't be accessed, apart from the end of each level when you jump on the flag. Also notable is that this game has only four worlds, half that of Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe time given for each level also reduces throughout the game, with the first two worlds having 280 seconds for each level, the third having 260 and the final world having 200. The ending omits Princess Peach (or an expy thereof) and instead replaces her with the message \"To be continued\", indicating that a sequel would be made.\n\nThe graphics could be considered accurate given the limitations of the MSX1, with most of the graphics ripped from Super Mario Bros. and downgraded somewhat, with the exception of the title screen which is redrawn and Lakitu which has been replaced with a ghost. The music is interpreted from the original game, although the soundtrack has been cut down considereably (the game only has the overworld and underworld themes) and the compositions themselves are inaccurate. The sound effects are crude when compared with the original game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Zemina","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182869,"FileName":"72095cfd-f7f3-46c0-97cb-89d44d00c4f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182869,"FileName":"cc947384-8a97-4d20-869f-32d253c2e2ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182869,"FileName":"82d9624f-c249-45cb-9463-8945cff8e01c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168593,"Name":"Super Boy II","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Super Boy II is an updated version of the Super Boy I with different and \"more difficult\" levels.

You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the \"EXTRA\" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word \"EXTRA\" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched. To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word \"EXTRA\" you will receive a bonus. On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7arsWJRZ_M","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Universal","Publisher":"Nidecom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"79c6d499-5bd4-4967-ae12-c50c4a378bba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"e07719ba-1f0b-4d03-996f-5a3a2d7e6c52.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"50a57f1e-c64c-43b3-8e0e-bb0d02008439.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"fec9d114-6dbe-4dda-9bdc-593542f5319d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"ee20f6e8-95a6-4a21-8fd3-3e67e2ee2b17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"eff8eba0-ce12-4588-b73c-6dcef41630a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"5569c7c9-e3f3-4375-9ebb-daebe8af8f6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168594,"FileName":"18e4dcf0-41ed-42ce-86ba-a7c2607038a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179561,"Name":"Super Snake","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Super Snake is an Action game, published by HAL Labs, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQnb0rOg4Zw","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"HAL Labs","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179561,"FileName":"5ac6e629-eb2c-461d-981b-550c9a64d474.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179561,"FileName":"f03fabcb-056c-49bc-b81e-11a94fbbe8cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":179561,"FileName":"5fefe83f-0bf8-4efb-907c-0e8e8f45fe31.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181386,"Name":"Super Soccer","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Super Soccer is a soccer (football) game for two players or one player against the computer.

His goal is to find one diamond hidden in a grain bag on each of four floors of the ship, before the wreck completely submerges beneath the waves. Of course, the ship is haunted. Spirit fires drift around the ship, and sometimes manifest as ghosts that will kill Tawara on contact. While the ghosts move slowly, Tawara's movement can be blocked by grain bags and larger spice barrels, which he needs to move before he can get anywhere. On the plus side, Tawara can throw grain bags at the ghosts to subdue them. Each throw costs energy though, and so only a limited number of throws are possible.\n\nIt is also possible for Tawara to explore the decks that are already underwater, but he has only a limited time before his oxygen runs out and he loses a life. On later levels, the submerged decks may be patrolled by sharks. The rise of the water can be slowed by closing the hatches between levels, but eventually the pressure builds causing the hatches to re-open.\n\nThere are a total of four levels of difficulty, and each difficulty has four screens.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4S-Yx8_6Dg","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"ASCII","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"c11b4993-4303-4e98-b9c5-ea11c901e825.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"a718ed49-98c6-4543-92b4-516f70b76303.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"883328b6-9a0e-44b2-a14d-5f6194ae3698.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"38988a47-6a06-4aaf-b4f1-f07027d7b8a8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"018f0566-6139-446d-9767-218e3de3a3a7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"c08eaf4e-8ba8-4bd6-8f7f-f313f53f1362.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"2423d9ab-f4a7-488d-a741-b9b5bd74e658.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"cac88ce9-db21-4160-bdb1-302f1efa5796.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"813417c1-ae63-411b-8e6a-1aaf0a843734.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"93a2542c-41f7-4e6d-b0b4-91c7db538a77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168606,"FileName":"43e40a32-51ad-413c-96b8-714ab675f8e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168606,"AlternateName":"Tawara-kun","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168606,"AlternateName":"たわらくん","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":188865,"Name":"Team Sanyo & Harvey Smith: Showjumper","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Showjumper allows you to compete on your own or against five other players to get the best time on 12 courses which are selected and competed on individually.

Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger!\n\nUse the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected. \n\nTo look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","Publisher":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155598,"FileName":"16ed7987-ae19-48cb-9869-04bebcf5bb11.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":155598,"FileName":"8e2ed8ef-6a3e-4f97-bbc2-e860c0a14870.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155598,"FileName":"a76bc0f7-e273-42d7-b610-71adf13a2919.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155598,"FileName":"25edd83d-3d0b-4f04-9cf1-51930ed1dcc6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188983,"Name":"Terrorpods","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Just because a region is bleak, desolate and inhospitable doesn't mean it lacks value. The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units.\n\nThe rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the Terrorpods in order to reach the bases.\n\nThe action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these.\n\nAs all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Icon Design","Publisher":"Dro Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188983,"FileName":"de6a6371-56b4-45e6-8a73-c27d9915a191.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":188983,"FileName":"d781c930-f56a-46b5-ae79-d9c89f53c1c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188983,"FileName":"47c8ff66-7149-4f01-8918-8fc1743a02aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188983,"FileName":"7545fa7f-b079-41f3-b57f-df4f4907a37a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168633,"Name":"Test Driver","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168633,"FileName":"74d85f35-4720-4180-b48f-e2ede46cba19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168633,"FileName":"c6f94d2e-7931-4d58-8a36-cf971eaedd5a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168633,"FileName":"9da62a73-b678-470b-b785-0def1da67736.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168633,"FileName":"246a82a4-37b6-4597-ae90-011f54978572.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168633,"FileName":"785ecb63-e7c1-488e-b25c-a73752d4e928.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181391,"Name":"Tetra Horror","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"In Tetra Horror the player takes on the role of an adventurer who has found a treasure map of the ancient city Tetra in South America.

For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.\n\nFor each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Activision, Inc.","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"794e19e4-c27f-40b7-8716-c15e0e2e8b52.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"037e59fe-51b1-4d69-bfeb-ff603c1e15ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"8a658c7b-9e7d-4716-8170-339ec53094aa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"79721637-3577-4f04-8d1b-bd22b5b87e94.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"a6693943-4df9-47fc-b4a6-546d53114f40.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"0a0cfdeb-39a6-456a-b9b9-a325657d16eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138604,"FileName":"1ad9418a-aece-497a-b12a-d0a5cb517ef5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":138604,"AlternateName":"Decathlon","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":94920,"Name":"The Apeman Strikes Again","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"The 'Apeman Strikes Again' is a well done and clone of Nintendo's 'Donkey Kong' (that was released on the MSX) and an underappreciated game on the MSX.\n'He is coming for you!' is an unforgettable line just like the evil laughter you hear when Mario falls to his death.\nThe game contains all 4 levels.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqntqY7AnJk","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Eaglesoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":94920,"FileName":"7b4f365a-819f-4622-8d71-7a05b62c2259.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":94920,"FileName":"04d2b770-c7c4-4e24-b3a2-2e8bde5103b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":94920,"FileName":"6c50ac25-70c5-4fab-a568-0c4763bce391.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190562,"Name":"The Arab World","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Al Alamiah","Publisher":"Al Alamiah","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190562,"FileName":"98e4e204-db00-439b-a008-1efb403c287b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":190562,"FileName":"763e052d-c1a8-4ae1-a719-71f5bce91ac1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":190562,"FileName":"e77737fb-9f5f-4932-8471-c66166ea5ebd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185076,"Name":"The Astrowulards","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Juan Fernando Molano","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185076,"FileName":"420199f6-5d93-4618-a5d7-9507a625ecce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185076,"FileName":"6f368178-6adc-4fdb-b754-2be93b396adb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":102505,"Name":"The A-Team","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Your assignment consists in guiding The A-Team through two dangerous missions.

The player with the most points wins the game.\nEpyx has secured a license from the Olympic Commitee of the United States for The Games - Winter Edition and The Games - Summer Edition.\nThe disciplines are partially divided into several sections in which the player has to do another action with the joystick.(igdb.com)","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Epyx","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseDate":"1988-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153443,"FileName":"5b843d4e-b2e3-451b-bfac-5af35b91fcc6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153443,"FileName":"46bade00-2147-47ab-a8de-e55f4fb0c167.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153443,"FileName":"d37647ba-a07c-499a-8691-fcabc645addb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153443,"FileName":"6b96ee15-7afc-46a6-974d-05ca5f1c4342.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31622,"Name":"The Goonies","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"While this MSX version of The Goonies borrows the basic concept from the Famicom (NES) version, it features completely different levels and enemies.

The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding. You could also use a help option which would display information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible. The player's score and ranking is displayed at particular times during the game. The percentage achieved relates to the rank, with 26% being 'a spotty creep' and 38% 'a middling thicko' for example.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Level 9 Computing, Ltd.","Publisher":"Mosaic Publishing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188930,"FileName":"49faa174-b070-464f-a315-9e8203971084.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188930,"FileName":"db67db76-bdf2-4c21-b47c-808c8f66ffaa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188930,"FileName":"fea9cd87-b29b-427c-ab0b-61882e53e031.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188930,"FileName":"997837a5-7eda-4c79-af57-fac71396e724.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188930,"FileName":"af8750d4-afea-4445-899b-449222aec04f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181971,"Name":"The Snowman","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"The Snowman is a fixed screen platform game based on the book by Raymond Briggs.

Society is rigidly functioning, unemployment, crime and poverty all non-existent. The economy functions on fines rather than taxes, making for a plethora of petty rules and no penal punishment. Robot employees make everything run cheaply. Body part reselling allows hospitals to turn a profit. Robots can even control human reproduction. The end result is a society in which humans have no useful role. Who would live in a 'paradise' like this?\n\nThe Worm In Paradise is the culmination of the Silicon Dreams series of interactive fiction. The Worm in Paradise is set about 50 years after the events of the previous game in the trilogy, Return to Eden. The game relies on strict timing and a day/night cycle (using a decimal clock with 10 100-minute hours) – return to your home before darkness falls, and don't expect robots to help with tasks which will not be finished in the day. Vital buildings can be located using colour-coded co-ordinates, but these change every time you load the game, so be careful to write them down.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"Mike Austin, Nick Austin & Pete Austin","Publisher":"Level 9 Computing, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"c1109cc4-6f3f-475d-ba96-14ce397178fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"bc8f1a00-616a-42b7-b482-6985931456ac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"14d82488-0df6-4d96-9203-6ad3b259a66e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"0f0ddbd8-5449-4e1e-b1d1-e2054ec4726d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"d482bc06-e8da-47a3-a044-2607b343e694.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"e222acfc-14a6-4389-a480-c9c0078e77d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"ac466e61-dcb6-4ce3-b218-4918573f498b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"d1f1b219-1d65-4d0e-86c3-ce3f6b8bc062.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"cd00dd4a-c77e-4aeb-ab08-82772bbffd47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181967,"FileName":"b5bb8385-d0ac-4313-9e22-87607fb534a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180768,"Name":"The Wreck","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0XbPoLBazc","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Electric Software","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180768,"FileName":"386828bd-f90f-4104-bd15-1ee96d1f75b3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180768,"FileName":"55fd2cd5-d783-4a01-b05e-fade9f748a63.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":180768,"FileName":"d83fde04-ba7f-4501-bf89-f9a5b1d378ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":180768,"FileName":"e349a839-fe99-47ae-9cc0-a5a53610493f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":180768,"FileName":"3ebd1a77-ce23-4917-aeb5-f6580b89afb0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123972,"Name":"Thexder","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty.

Thus, on the first stage, the disco, he will have to avoid some crude dudes, siphons, drinks which fall from above, etc., whereas he desperately looks for the eight plates that will allow the access to the next levels, which are: the beach, the pirate ship, and finally, the Acid House.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Iber Soft","Publisher":"MCM Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155671,"FileName":"e42907bc-b2a1-4402-abcc-8a16ee92d349.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":155671,"FileName":"728278fa-8d96-4768-ae62-8161d82e736a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155671,"FileName":"0e1e148e-1ad1-4b39-bcf9-286daf58be08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155810,"Name":"Tom & Jerry","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Tom & Jerry is a platformer based on the two cartoon animals.

He works for Sheik Abdul Al Kohol, the dictator of El Khazi, who is known for his fabulous car collection. Because Sheik Abdul Al Kohol doesn't pay Mick The Mechanic too well - he's getting payed in sheep's eye balls - he is going to steal the sheik's cars.\n\nTo do that he has to collect oil for the car to make it drive off to the next screen. However, the sheik's cars are protected by fanatical and murderous Arabian bodyguards.\n\nMick has to climb on and off ladders to collect the oil in his oil can and, when the can is full, pouring it down the grid into the car. Mick can also spill a drip of oil to let an Arabian bodyguard slip (or himself if done wrong). Tools that appear occasionally on various places on the screen will give special bonuses when these tools are collected and returned to the workshop.\n\nThe cars in the garage are not visible at first. When oil is poured into the grid the car becomes more and more visible. The car becomes fully visible when it is full of oil.\n\nThe game features 26 screens and each screen has a different maze-like lay-out that contains multiple hazards and obstacles like springboards, walls that disappear, conveyor belts, elevators and rope swings. The cars become more expensive when you progress in the game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","Publisher":"Bug-Byte Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156429,"FileName":"45f2ed81-072f-412a-8843-f0f5c72a3b3b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":156429,"FileName":"e5256ee7-1512-491c-abf0-81601a433258.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":156429,"FileName":"90e53b20-b5ca-4706-85ce-de244cf557f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156429,"FileName":"a14c9401-34f4-4e42-9c1a-ea33d7edd19d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156429,"FileName":"77a24d01-eddb-4c85-abe0-ab4f6105fa8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156429,"FileName":"94038a99-836b-4f23-b52a-9725004de497.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168793,"Name":"Tuxy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168793,"FileName":"b169804c-4cf3-4bf4-933b-dabdaec10200.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168793,"FileName":"07e53d65-1737-4b71-afb5-b78a3f023548.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33850,"Name":"Twin Bee","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter.

You control an aircraft which fires guns straight ahead when it is in the top half of the screen, and drops bombs when at the lower half of the screen. If you are hit, or if a plane from the ship is beamed-up by a saucer, or smashed by a monster, you lose a life.

The progress of the convoy is shown at the bottom of the screen. Again, you start in a plane and can defend the convoy by attacking the monster's legs causing it to trip. Alternatively, you can land the plane ahead of the monster, and activate the beta capsule to summon Ultraman. The game then becomes a beat-em-up, where Ultraman can walk, jump, punch and kick the opponent while your monstrous opponent tries to do the same to you. If the monster destroys a truck, then you lose a life.

It is the third game to be based on the popular MASK comics, TV series, and books of the mid 1980's.\n\nThe M.A.S.K., Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, organisation led by Matt Trakker, are battling the criminal organization known as V.E.N.O.M., Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem. Combat in the previous two games has been based around the transformer like vehicles used by M.A.S.K., not so in this game. In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt has been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or never see his son alive again.\n\nMatt sets out for the moon where he must overcome the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son and steal a rocket back to earth. In his quest he is helped by special masks that give him special powers. For example one mask will give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, float across bodies of water, have temporary invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only carry four masks and can only use one mask at a time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or bullets, and this number is reduced each time the mask is used so eventually the mask will need replacing.\n\nAt the end of each level as Matt progresses to the next the player gets a code word. This codeword can be typed in when the game is re-loaded allowing the player to restart at the new level.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/etDmdQn0AwU","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"215f846a-dda9-4c30-b624-4eca8d02c124.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"55aea2fb-79eb-45b3-8374-b34e1962349c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"323173c2-9a1a-4664-87ee-9f89c8d3aa03.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"0669d7d6-f655-4e0e-afa1-39e4993054e4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"ce749116-da3a-41f6-b190-65bb3bf7dde9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"317dc688-7fac-4d50-b176-dc1209bbbf52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":154275,"FileName":"80c3ffcf-7639-4210-90d2-b110e5d7de6b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":154275,"AlternateName":"MASK III : VENOM Strikes Back","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":180787,"Name":"Venture","ReleaseYear":"2011","Overview":"Exidy's Venture game from ColecoVision converted to MSX by GDX.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Exidy","Publisher":"GDX","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180787,"FileName":"f0789af1-fe71-48c2-b0f6-3a8434100739.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180787,"FileName":"ddf76ff3-2428-461e-a5be-7221ca316292.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180787,"FileName":"46c61d25-2721-416f-acd4-1755f1c73e56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181396,"Name":"Venus Fire","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Victor Interactive Software","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181396,"FileName":"d19080be-7795-49ef-8b9a-e46f3b74cd6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181396,"FileName":"3ab02c62-322c-4894-a8b3-50c8c7390992.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156946,"Name":"Vestron","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"In the intergalactic war, the Amstradian empire has taken over most of the known universe.

It is discovered that the old mining planet of Vestron contains a special kind of crystals which can be substituted for oil. Retrieving these crystals is imperative for Earth to be able to keep on fighting, so you are sent alone to recover the energy source from Vestron.\n\nThe game is made up of two different screens. On the static screen, you fly around in your space suit right above the surface, where crystals can be found. Pick up the crystals while avoiding the Amstradians, which luckily move back and forth in preset patterns. If you run the risk of a collision, you can press the space bar to activate your Asteroids style emergency teleport. This feature should be used only as a last-ditch effort, since you could just as well teleport straight into another enemy. You can travel up, left and right, to travel down you just let gravity do its job.\n\nAfter having retrieved the crystals on the static screen, you progress to a scrolling screen which takes you to the next crystal site. In order to get through this screen, you must avoid all the Amstradian ships which attack in a kamikaze fashion. Reflexes are a requirement, since the enemies move very quickly and track all your movements.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Players","Publisher":"Players","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156946,"FileName":"31d88f6f-955e-4585-9857-e8bc0f14c2dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":156946,"FileName":"84d70707-f7ff-4f4d-ac05-3bb55e32f3af.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":156946,"FileName":"97fd8687-6151-4c76-9086-b303168eaa64.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":156946,"FileName":"dd21afc3-3652-49f1-92ed-efd446d5c16a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156946,"FileName":"2d77f84a-b3d4-4e25-b54b-4ec27fb3e490.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156948,"Name":"Viaje al Centro de La Tierra","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"In this Jules Verne inspired game you are gonna take a journey to the center of the earth.

There's also the zapper, a vertically moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it will die.\n\nThe enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you'll also fight furry animals like camels and goats.\n\nNew in Voidrunner is that you don't just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming in from behind.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Llamasoft Ltd.","Publisher":"M.A.D.

To become strong enough to defeat the dragon, you need to pick-up various power-ups (denoted by question marks) scattered throughout the dungeon. These provide random increases (or sometimes decreases) to various statistics such as Strength, Hit Points, Attack Points, Armour Class and Money.\n\nAt certain fixed squares of the maze, monsters will appear and slowly chase you. If you are caught, you are taken to a combat screen where the battle is automatically played out. Each round of combat uses a point of Strength. If you lose the round, you will be damaged which causes a reduction in Armor Class or Hit Points. You are then given the option of continuing combat. Alternatively, you may win the round and cause some amount of damage to your opponent related to Attack Points. If your opponent is killed, you will usually gain Experience points, although later in the game you will sometimes lose points for a kill.\n\nThe game is lost if your Strength or Hit Points are reduced below zero, but you win if you gain sufficiently high statistics and confront the dragon for the final battle.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"ASCII","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseDate":"1983-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":152771,"FileName":"81e8ac80-471d-4930-b003-6f8be7982f1a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":152771,"FileName":"6895faf9-99ae-4f76-bc02-611fdd514f8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":152771,"FileName":"352adabe-c889-4c15-9a97-0d5a94f9e8ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168904,"Name":"Warroid","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Warroid is a game that pits two players (or one player and the AI) against each other in a robot versus robot fight.

Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of different areas viewed in Atic Atac (meaning that the player would often have to work out how to reach some sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, delimiting some sections of the screens.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Bubble Bus Software","Publisher":"Bubble Bus Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188999,"FileName":"119dcfbb-ecdb-48d5-9b4b-6c7e5dc4f89a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":188999,"FileName":"ec8cf255-9a61-462d-80c4-d3f06bfcbf59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188999,"FileName":"69f9bfe5-37c1-43fd-8882-6e337ad8ee09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181306,"Name":"Wonderfull Child","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":"Al Alamiah","Publisher":"Al Alamiah","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181306,"FileName":"0f021683-fc09-4670-ba28-99e2efd6eddd.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":181306,"FileName":"e5eed303-26f9-43be-a3ba-bb7229feb6e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181306,"FileName":"332d4f0b-f24b-49ac-b91e-ceb5b28f59ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168906,"Name":"World Games","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"World Games is an Olympics-style sports game with arcade-oriented gameplay.

The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \"karma\" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many \"good\" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1987-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"8ccc07ca-5326-4169-93f3-6ff97904a6ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"496c2bf4-1fb8-4f44-ab67-23e1dda48303.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"4c2cc16b-86d6-416e-b3b3-e0f3b315e71e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"89706697-08fb-473b-8531-8e617f37c8af.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"b5f294b5-269d-4ae9-82c6-8ed932debd31.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"045703a9-4838-4788-a0ef-cbe1308bcb29.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"25b7c9b0-0dbe-4ae4-95c2-bed6c612caae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"6b0718fc-1219-44fa-8c89-5cec495175b8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"c1d0b5ec-8cee-4db5-b2bf-af23a8584f78.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33997,"FileName":"f3669c99-34df-43e0-b586-a6c86748a7b6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33997,"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer II","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33997,"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":156343,"Name":"Xenon","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"From the moment that Captain Xod's face appeared out of the static on the communicator, you knew he was in trouble.

At the end of each sector you have a chance to refuel and restock but only after you have defeated the most vicious alien you have ever seen. A strategic vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. You have the option of swapping between two very different craft, to suit the challenge facing you at the time; either a ground-based saucer or well-armed, and faster fighter aircraft. A fast-moving, thinking man's shoot-em-up. GAMEPLAY You have to negotiate four sectors, each divided into four zones. You have a choice of two craft, which you can change between at will. You have a ground craft, capable of eight-way movement, and a faster jet fighter. You need to select the appropriate craft to negotiate the obstacles facing you and be prepared to change between them rapidly. Certain of your opponents are ground-based and some are altitude. You need to be in the correct craft to shoot the alien that you are facing. Certain weapons can only be collected and used by the fighter craft. You can only use the ground craft on the ground. You cannot land on the top of buildings. You need to fly over these in the fighter. Shooting the aliens and their weapon emplacements reveals power cells.

There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmlsfPw_qaI","Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","Publisher":"Philips Export B.V.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"16687e4a-9c9f-4d12-aa91-0cdf6e23d98b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"84b29967-a22a-4c81-95a3-7a6a8d861a52.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"ab3d2850-3c4f-4b8c-b7a4-46f4e2f7526d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"2e940f36-1ee3-4b2b-aac0-a3cf84254aea.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"d251c874-ad26-4055-a101-fa3402777553.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"8779643d-e0d3-4dae-b0ab-67110ffba00f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"5b5e47b7-4b9a-4ca4-8d0b-eb609fe0acfb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129319,"FileName":"96656311-4a77-40a7-8fc6-9fe0eef8e0a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":129318,"Name":"Zenji","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129318,"FileName":"4cf79575-d710-46a0-8a65-de7bef3087fe.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":129318,"FileName":"a9ec104f-7773-4ea3-a5a7-0eed4cb2e610.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168909,"Name":"Zeta 2000","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Pixel","Publisher":"Pixel","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168909,"FileName":"97ef3d53-8c6b-4e2b-ad4a-7abdb1284944.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168909,"FileName":"2cbb4e8b-edbe-44d4-8fdf-c8a18c88be2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151475,"Name":"Zexas Limited","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Publisher":"dB-Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151475,"FileName":"06a63e72-3b82-4298-a24a-30fa00fe8aa6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151475,"FileName":"ab8ea8f9-edfb-4a1e-ac37-55a651cee747.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151475,"FileName":"fd165862-fa2c-4828-bfd0-b87752074958.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":151475,"AlternateName":"ゼクサスリミテッド","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":189001,"Name":"Zipi y Zape","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Dro Soft","Publisher":"Dro Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189001,"FileName":"bca828a4-809f-4d96-b834-ce64eae9dac9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":189001,"FileName":"6fe931e1-279f-4d02-8a76-c71aabdc77b5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":189001,"FileName":"1a53930e-30c5-4e61-b232-64a892a46cb1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189002,"Name":"Zipper","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"D.
