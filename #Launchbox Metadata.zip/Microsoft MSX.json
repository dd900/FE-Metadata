Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes.

The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring).

However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games as well as Japanese culture. The music is mostly taken from classical music pieces.\n\nThe player can play as either Takosuke, an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as moai.

The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and \"bump\" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.\n\nThe player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.","Publisher":"Square","ReleaseDate":"1985-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M9c4Pg4C5cs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Slayer_(video_game)"},"33791":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Majou Densetsu III: Shalom","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Knightmare III: Shalom"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"7fdbe548-beba-47f0-b42c-91be20478a14.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"27e4813c-eddc-4a19-bcdc-b94bae3a875e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"df638470-4609-4502-9d33-dd2d204417b4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"473025e4-d9ea-4239-a106-582ddf8fcd33.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"30370033-5faf-4dfb-a429-6476e2120fce.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3b3c18c6-7682-4bb3-b223-04d41da57b10.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"13190bd1-aade-4e84-81dc-573ff4447510.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"437e83bd-a790-4a32-8f8d-d6998558f9fe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6c8222d7-e768-4fb3-b56e-d03296968ee6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shalom: Knightmare III","Overview":"In this game, you play the role of a Japanese high-school student, the leader of computer club.

The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \"karma\" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many \"good\" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1987-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34003":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dempa Shinbunsha","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"47e1404e-26e5-41e3-9980-39a777713b07.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bcfc3d36-cd35-424b-8888-6cadb5ae717d.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f678480-ada5-431c-bab0-616958213166.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc4e3244-faf6-41f7-a1fb-27d34ef99845.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0693b1c5-41df-4384-b1eb-d583cb464527.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Knither Special","Overview":"Knither is the sequel to Demon Crystal.

Each consists of a regular grid of indestructible walls, randomly placed destructible walls, and enemies (Floaters) moving between them. The goal of the Bomberman (or Eric in the UK version) is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Prw5lPLcsXI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)"},"34395":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"4228acd2-315b-4575-95c3-6090f09f5f88.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"55029a59-a19b-416c-b799-53c95d566d96.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88066cb1-7456-4fe3-b0e0-b797e02fb4b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ebe90a47-a729-42e2-8e4c-4c3fe04f8a6f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4d5958cb-1ae4-4b17-a119-738a8516ba6d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"992c7f7c-f5dd-48bc-b030-e3df34e10908.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e0528aac-c18b-44c0-9d5c-19ecbded1942.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"72c75995-c277-4ec9-8069-a6db305dd0a5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3731edb2-2b40-4ea8-ae46-262c2c77adde.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Final Zone Wolf","Overview":"Final Zone is an overhead run-'n-gun action game like Capcom's Commando, but it's not just that.

The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once.

It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first \"martyrs\"; several important programmers were fired after becoming \"addicted\" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.\n\nIn the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called \"La Aventura Original\" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.\n\nThis version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, \"ñ\"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.","Publisher":"Aventuras AD","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"95659":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sydney Development","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"626e2d9b-89df-46e8-9ecd-bd7ce9bec6d7.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1576dfde-abec-4910-8010-f74d53c18d43.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7000ba04-6af0-4804-ae28-b3cff9b542d9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"93ab4a8d-0701-4bd5-9715-b7a551c4a7f1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3fa76d7-dede-4fa5-86b7-d5ab980eae47.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc033ed1-60f1-4319-bb1f-2bba2a8da3b8.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56b9111e-a558-4898-84c8-f60812913bc1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"29833397-702b-4930-842e-0c35f910ccfe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cb7d302d-4540-4ab8-9580-15dff24fa145.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"B.C.

Hundra offered to go to the kingdom of Lukx, and gather three sacred gems, stolen a long time ago from the Gods, to rescue her father.","Publisher":"Dinamic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pXLacW2T0Uw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hundra_(video_game)"},"104351":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Topo Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ef8d23f2-41c1-4606-83a1-6316135c63a5.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d15ede0e-86a7-4d09-b39c-ccf817b955c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"425db1eb-c08f-4258-99a6-5d070f0e59d9.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"09c26088-a6be-4f7c-a5d9-a586c73be95c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"73602b16-a71f-4b85-adfd-64b210a9443a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"75d8577f-a6dd-4bb3-8be4-2c3f5c1d9115.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Silent Shadow","Overview":"Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist.

The conversion is based on the Mission Colecovision emulator for MSX and features some nice improvements such as SCC sound by default and improved support for keyboard and joysticks.","Publisher":"Repro-Factory","ReleaseYear":2017,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iW4BA94LQgI"},"126314":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"aRoid","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"αRoid","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pony Canyon","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"60fbc911-6d63-47c2-a0c4-d79a38a1d3c4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"98e2e6da-ff90-40f2-b5ce-8a12d645580d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4c8915fd-fe2f-43fb-81f0-7d5c74d44d25.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"58b9042a-22d2-49fb-9a18-a038a5681522.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"90353313-a121-4caa-b047-5aefae7bf4f5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6856c238-1522-435f-9fea-7f6b5f584820.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"315b9bd4-c2fa-4c33-ac57-2443c5026661.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"729b487f-4c99-4b1d-a47f-d2035b0b8a5e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"629cec5f-7a12-44f7-8a61-bab652c8f281.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1bc9cb94-b9f6-4d97-a5ed-e6e5895b0f73.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b8fd02be-9a7f-475a-b916-728ecd05c49b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alpha Roid","Overview":"Alpha Roid is an Action game, developed and published by Pony Canyon, which was released in Japan in 1986.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dQL_fWcT0Pc"},"126318":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mass Tael","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"91842290-fbe3-48f1-87ad-cf1c9044ea1a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"468ce234-c4d2-4c84-9f0f-9a63f002d526.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"be275e71-3971-4c1b-b5dd-6b65ada1d58c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ced3e0f0-785e-4969-a4b1-8afc57c962a7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f959b963-12af-48b9-b457-6b557c38d9d0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11baee90-131f-4212-81a5-eb9637ddf466.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"098964b1-526c-46f6-8acf-981dcb78a9bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bad66e37-e89e-4325-a6e1-d6e093bea72f.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9705f6b9-289e-4738-b843-03a75c1a3062.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Angelo","Overview":"Angelo is an Action game, developed by Mass Tael LTD and published by ASCII Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1985.","Publisher":"Ascii Entertainment","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fvlzSRCwpZ8"},"126347":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sein Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d193b47a-b77d-4215-97d4-c38379598b8f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5d472eca-9f57-4855-8cd0-f3fb6649fc0c.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"97952bfc-54aa-4421-98b8-8b8147716078.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"19722bf4-a19c-437d-9086-108b25845d03.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1b0273f1-6adf-44fd-81dc-d642ca1b767c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ae02b8cf-ed0c-4b7f-b6af-e52f9e93a485.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d360bd06-94d1-43f1-82c9-873c3a5e7332.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aramo","Overview":"Far away from galaxy.

Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces. Doing that will send their opponents piece back to their own home base.","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v963m1c7-so"},"126465":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Battleship Clapton II"},{"Name":"Clapton II","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"T&ESOFT","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e76b7fab-b593-4b9d-980e-f2d8f27885c7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dd39939a-9883-4c11-8cff-fba6ae49e997.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"758c5b3e-82ee-4d07-88d3-1ec70b02ab26.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"78ebd5e5-c505-4a08-a6dc-9100d7dd22cb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9f2c2515-c2b1-48c8-93fa-7bc6a5966311.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8214f05d-ed81-47d0-86dd-0a4d098684f0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eeeeed38-9910-4286-a0d2-22259c206db6.JPG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4ac1bc56-e2cc-4231-b2b7-4b7ad825fd48.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c65b6a8-0230-42da-9e34-467e7b92042e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2000cdfb-a584-4766-91af-743094aaa30b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Battle Ship Clapton II","Overview":"In this basic, top-down shoot-em-up set in space the player can move the ship anywhere on the screen to shoot the incoming enemy ships.

The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions, and can fire both forward and backward. Each round consists of a number of green enemy bases that must all be destroyed to advance to the next round (a semi-transparent automap helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later rounds the core is capable of defending itself (opening and closing while launching missiles).\nAdditionally, the player must avoid or destroy stationary asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships which attempt to collide with his or her ship. Enemy bases will also occasionally launch formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) will also appear occasionally, which must be destroyed or the round will go to \"condition red\" regardless of how long the player has taken.","Publisher":"Namcot","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cWhAIIhRjI4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bosconian"},"126518":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Bytebusters","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"3cfc6dc2-322d-408d-a44b-2bbafab0354e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c46ea795-67c9-4ff6-8bdc-e8f33c1756f0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eab83a2b-d6f5-47df-8354-31e44fae3f38.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"78c35599-f760-41dd-a2c4-38dabf63e538.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"10a58763-93a8-4485-9368-dc60d3efc89b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5fb8271c-67bb-4019-8787-e0f0fd4cfdc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"eac37eea-b095-499e-bf26-8450a1d0bc2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Break In","Overview":"You have to prevent a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks.

Along the way, he must negotiate numerous hazards, including pits, quicksand, rolling logs, fire, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and crocodiles. Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on vines. Treasure includes bags of money, gold and silver bars, and diamond rings, which range in value from 2000 to 5000 points in 1000 point increments. There are eight of each treasure type, with 32 in total. A perfect score of 114,000 is achieved by claiming all 32 treasures without losing any points. Points are deducted by either falling in a hole (100 points) or touching logs; point loss depends on how long contact is made with the log. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various points. Traveling though the tunnel moves forward three screens at a time, which is necessary in order to collect all the treasures within the time limit. However, the tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player to return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again, thus wasting time. The tunnels also contain scorpions. The player loses a life if Harry comes in contact with any obstacle (except logs) or falls into a tar pit, quicksand, waterhole, or mouth of a crocodile. The game ends when either all 32 treasures have been collected, all three lives have been lost, or the time has run out.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Uqh49op5Hl4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pitfall!"},"126894":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zap","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"5ebb0379-630d-405a-a16b-8bfa74896491.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"30c0ad99-2c0a-4854-86ba-b4f4fa6a3a56.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cd620e81-b8ed-4858-9cdf-30f73e9fe699.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf98d0c5-2194-4e13-a736-6b7ae4a1fe49.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"db1627f1-a433-4ee9-bdb6-6b1ec86b4623.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"48f3a71b-09c3-4c6e-b999-f34887f56f59.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"35d997e8-7957-4cdf-99e9-a6c25b33abf8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Glider","Overview":"Glider is a Strategy game, developed and published by Zap, which was released in Japan in 1985.","Publisher":"Zap","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jnN8Ez8TJ30"},"126940":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Crest of the Dragon King Hades of Darkness"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Casio","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"bde6bacb-6a90-4ad0-a420-6e23440e2502.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c6b16613-3f11-4167-94cd-3f78ec03dc68.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26b0e41c-9ce4-4572-b207-2bd0ceabf410.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"491e8e70-3a55-4115-8bd4-ef9ea6c6b325.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ad8eb9df-769e-4f26-9dc3-fd3da639d2dc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"384702cd-87e8-4a04-b965-90811fcc50f6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"8278b2da-20ad-4fea-bbfd-41ce99b95bd0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"05a09622-9af7-402a-b17a-03c7e4d9cf48.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yami no Ryu ou Hades no Monshou","Overview":"Yami no Ryu ou Hades no Monshou (Japanese Romanji), Crest of the Dragon King Hades of Darkness (English Translation) is a Shoot-'em-up game published and developed by Casio, released in 1986 in Japan.","Publisher":"Casio","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kp18OTJmOoI"},"127048":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"f6ec7f5c-2655-4e04-b415-a085648c26de.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"aaa58dc9-b863-4baa-b32f-d5aaa74eb7fa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e70380ce-bb70-4a8b-8eb0-48a39b532f92.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cfaf143f-cab6-476c-b7c0-a7b9d76eb396.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e28da09-6a8e-4d48-ad7e-4be1bd02b216.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"856f1fc7-7d7a-4b0d-a569-013c411ff186.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"66413884-38dc-4590-ae3c-e3043eefef20.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0fcfece5-87fc-4fbd-9032-a2e000bf1194.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"823171c2-1684-4d0a-ad08-4c4adfcace8f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"36fd96f1-3654-4487-bb31-9ac746aed480.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Hole in One Professional","Overview":"The grandiose and yet elegant course layout - the beatiful Hal Country Club.

Waves increase in difficulty, with every third or fourth wave being a formation wave where the aliens appear and attack in a particular pattern. Aliens mutate into more dangerous forms the longer they survive, so they should be killed as quickly as possible. The radar at the top of the screen shows what kinds of aliens are approaching and where they will appear. The aliens usually release white bombs these cannot be shot down, only avoided. They also release homing bombs, which are more dangerous but can be destroyed. Shooting the asteroid and capturing the \"mystery\" inside will stop the aliens from firing altogether for about 10 seconds, and give you bonus points for each alien you kill. You have 99 seconds to complete each wave. The quicker you complete the wave, the higher your bonus. An extra ship is awarded every 100,000 points. Using the warp button lets you escape from sticky situations. You have three warps for each wave, but warps do not accumulate from wave to wave.","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QtWAwiV1uNk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Juno_First"},"127411":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"df861575-37e9-4ded-af98-60d7f1dda87b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"742882ae-980d-4389-bc99-7b8454da8c07.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5fbae3c6-9c18-4ca2-9815-b9fcbd8ab99c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6cc69866-5279-42d7-9b2a-adcff82e6706.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7fb3a1e2-a3f0-4d96-a88b-2c10274b9c29.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5c7ea3f-3657-4f58-97a5-34dc15221923.png","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1e176b53-ae94-4d97-87da-c8c9575fb15a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9b3e62b3-4f08-434d-bded-61ac8b54453d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6e3f09a7-2125-4dc9-913f-670d8240aa0b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4d7d66d6-963d-41b1-be14-1e905ad5dee5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Keystone Kapers","Overview":"The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose!

Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down.

The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator.

If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.\n\nSince the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point.\n\nOther rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.\n\nIn a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.","Publisher":"Irem Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1983-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/10-Yard_Fight"},"129318":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4cf79575-d710-46a0-8a65-de7bef3087fe.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a9ec104f-7773-4ea3-a5a7-0eed4cb2e610.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Zenji","Overview":"Zenji is an action\/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze.

Lesser known is this game, Animal Land Satsujin Jiken (“Animal Land Murder Case”), despite following the same mold…except all of the characters are anthropomorphic animals. The story puts you in the shoes of a rookie canine shamus named Oidon, as he investigates the murder of Gonkichi, a fox and owner of a jewelry store. The story gets even darker when the case interweaves with the suicide a panda named Linlin.\n\nThe game plays out similarly to all of the others of the era, as you select various commands to investigate crime scenes and quiz suspects. Through rather than the first person labyrinth you explore in the Famicom version of Portopia, instead here’s an overhead scene where you explore a complicated forest. This aspect that makes it stand out, of course, is the setting and the artwork. Due to the limitations (both resolution and palette) of the MSX, it looks quite a bit different than typical adventure games that appeared on the PC88, but the artwork itself is excellent considering its limitations, with a distinctive and appealing style.\n\nHuman-like animals investigating crimes actually isn’t all that out of th  ordinary for the Japanese audience – after all there was a cartoon earlier in the 80s known in English as Sherlock Hound, featuring a canine version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective. (It’s well worth checking out, especially as some episodes were directed by Hayao Miyazaki in the earlier days of his career.) But the concept isn’t just used for stylistic purposes – all of the characters being animals like dogs, cats, foxes and pandas plays into the game’s shocking twist ending, which absolutely couldn’t be done in any type of murder mystery. (As a clue it’s sort of similar to the setup of the Dreamworks animated film Penguins of Madagascar, which was released nearly two decades later. The title of the game also gives a vague hint.) The game was never ported outside of its original MSX appearance, which is saddening, because Animal Land Satsujin Jiken deserves recognition for this alone.","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=57q9x1dHnxs&ab_channel=LordKarnov42"},"132911":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bothtec","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"66a3ae84-74b0-47dc-b97b-d4e35acc5b28.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7b04c7c5-61d8-4c20-ae9a-c46e99cf88f4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"05b92a00-7af7-418d-a4b6-6c220d47c8fb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d57fc9e-45f9-4833-aaab-7364fe829f1e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a43c6785-08b8-44ed-bea8-df7563e2787e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bd790b83-c709-480f-a412-4e04d6cd460f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Anty","Overview":"Anty is an arcade game where players control termites.

A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.\n\nThe game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures, but it’s a bit more complex than, say, Irem’s Kung Fu Master. It’s not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you’ll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas. It’s not entirely clear when you’ve actually done this though, because there aren’t any indicators that you’ve hopped onto a different path unless you actually walk in a different direction and notice the change in scenery. Indeed, most other games that used this structure had things like warp doors, which at least made it clear when you’ve jumped somewhere else. There is an early item that will display an onscreen map, but it only shows your vague location as a tiny dot, and instead expects that you’ll map out everything on your own. You’ll need to find several other keys and items, power up the hero, and find the Wolf Castle before you can beat the game.\n\nThe whole game is  confusing, but made infinitely more difficulty because the action is very poorly implemented. The hero tanuki may be skilled in martial arts, but he’s still not very good at them, because his attacks have absolutely no range, making it hard to get in attacks without receiving damage at the same time. Foes spawn constantly and move at the same rate as the tanuki, making them impossible to outrun. It’s here where the game presents some comedy, as defeated foes are literally flung across the screen. Additionally, these baddies are apparently so thirsty for tanuki blood that they can be lured right into the many, many holes that litter the forest, sending them to their own Wile E. Coyote-style doom. You’ll actually be doing this a whole lot if you want keep your health up too, though falling into those holes will also instantly kill you. Technically there are no continues, but there is a password function that lets you pick up with your items intact.\n\nThe theme song of the game is pretty catchy, if repetitive, and Technosoft apparently thought so highly of it that the package includes an audio tape with arranged version of its two tracks. (These were both included on Illusion: Tecno Soft Game Music Collection Vol. 1)\n\nBatten Tanuki no Daibouken is definitely one of those games where its wild concept is more interesting than the game itself, which doesn’t really capitalize on its premise and is painfully stereotypical of 1980s computer games. Alas, Technosoft later found their niche with shoot-em-ups like Thunder Force, and never revisited the concept. The idea of action hero anthropomorphs may have been more popularized by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a few years later, but darned if a karate tanuki isn’t a great idea for a character.","Publisher":"Tecno Soft","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132913":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Boggy'84"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Colpax","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"2a42ab32-aeed-44a7-bca4-b98b8678fc3d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8873dfe5-5396-4c80-82d9-323f23b88932.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2168bc4d-3caa-48d3-9e8e-59658c619c2e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7029dc59-dad2-41f3-81b4-a7a4a0b2e052.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"925fe5e5-c307-4243-a3d5-725518f5aaa2.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b34fb10e-f524-46c5-8ef2-6d25a687922f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"887c1bd3-dcdf-47ad-a4da-5110da96d17c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"62564d34-548e-4bf4-8422-151f69353447.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Boggy '84","Overview":"Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the homecomputer boom.

The board is an 8x8 square on which white and black tokens are placed. The starting position has two tokens of each colour diagonally opposite in the central 2x2 square. Black then places a token so that there is now one or more lines (of one or more consecutive white tokens) between the placed token and another black token. These lines can be either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and results in all of those tokens being flipped to black. The same rule applies when white plays to flip black tokens. Players alternate placing single tokens at a time, and must flip a token each turn. Only if no legal move is available can they pass. The aim is to have the most tokens of your colour before both players need to pass.\n\nThis version of othello allows play against the computer, with up to four skill levels.

However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.\nThe player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.\n\nThe object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-09T00:00:00-07:00"},"132939":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fun Project","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d491e2d8-1947-4a0f-a8bd-a84de40bf926.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c3de6909-c1e7-4f6b-978d-4000a47038a2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bab78b3a-c404-4760-b7b9-44993711b87a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb13fea1-d62c-49d1-ba4b-c94e0e9eae76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"eeeff956-823c-4579-b8e9-5a536f399074.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Drainer","Overview":"'Think before you act' is the maxim of this game.

Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.\n\nEnemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:\n\n    Shooting them with his gun.\n    Kicking them by jumping onto them.\n    Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.\n    Crushing them with an elevator.\n\nWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.\n\nWhile Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall.\n\nJust because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.\n\nOtto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.\n\nIf Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.","Publisher":"Nidecom Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elevator_Action"},"132946":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Jaleco","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"cacc1563-7579-4eb8-b8c4-28aeb4561255.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d422c632-03bb-4820-8cd6-f084304b4ede.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a194a54b-1bb4-4f22-b0fc-8900d76aac38.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"52255c35-7abf-49fd-bc7d-4155e5d16791.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6c296065-8ef7-4b81-b822-7d859b35db8e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"750193dc-3fe6-4737-8c0d-8f8b9f6f5e30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b1f5fda1-3548-4896-9784-2001320a6a74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Exerion","Overview":"This is a shoot-em-up game with parallax effects in the background.

Flying across – or inside – a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.\n\nThe game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DkeWijrZGKg"},"133013":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A.C.G.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"bec16608-67b3-4001-9f21-ce1ff2a716a2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"45528608-df61-4203-ac5f-113a17efb1bf.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"959a574e-5505-4e5f-8ce4-391b90527735.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1a0a66bf-8529-4e48-b5f9-4991424042b8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1592dd9e-9785-4410-b638-1216480dfc6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"301d78eb-e1fd-4735-bb04-3b2f2283b62e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Gunfright","Overview":"The player takes the part of the \"meanest and fastest Gun Totin'Bunch of Rootin' Tootin' Gun Slingers which ever did hit the Wild West\", Sheriff Quickdraw.

There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"133019":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Casio","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4a4afecf-a110-45af-bddc-8ce2a08c8cbd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bcd63edb-f456-4acd-a40d-3eb3e50aa276.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a210f895-c3f4-44c4-a57b-51fa02dae138.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0ffc0fed-0a7b-4780-9ce5-5375e307a935.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"64cc8f0c-52be-42e3-ac5f-e326c006ad3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"473abb45-1afb-42a6-8044-14d587b2e196.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ice World","Overview":"This game plays very much like a mix between the classic Sega arcade game Pengo and that old brain teasing favourite Sokoban.

Similar to the original version of the Portopia Serial Murder Case, the game was developed single handedly by Yuji Horii, including writing the game's scenario, designing, programming and even creating the ingame art. Enix published the title in May 1985 for the NEC PC-88 and ports for various Japanese computers followed shortly afterwards. A complete remake of Karuizawa Yuukai Annai was eventually released by Enix and later Square Enix for mobile phones in 2002. A second mobile remake was also created in 2005 that featured new artwork. The title has since been retroactively branded as part of a trilogy called Yuji Horii Mysteries which includes all the adventure games created by Yuji Horii.\n\nThe story follows a young collage student named Shiro who is visiting his girlfriend Kumiko while she is vacationing with her sister, Nagisa, at their villa in the town of Karuizawa. However, one day Nagisa does not return home and the couple suspects that she has been kidnapped after receiving a mysterious phone call. With the local police unable to to find Nagisa, Kumiko and the player begin exploring Karuizawa themselves to gather information in order to find out what happened to Nagisa.\n\nKaruizawa Yuukai Annai has the player visiting various places modeled after real-word locations in Karuizawa through an Ultima-style overworld map. Once the player arrives at a landmark, the perceptive changes to a first-person viewpoint where the player uses verb commands listed on the side of the screen to interact with the environment and talk to characters, similar to Yuji Horii's Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin. However, unlike the other adventure titles developed by Yuji Horii, Karuizawa Yuukai Annai has mild sexual content with the game featuring nudity and even commands for the player to \"kiss\" or \"hold\" certain characters.\n\nThe game is separated into six chapters and during the final chapter the gameplay changes to that of a basic western-style RPG where the player engages in battles on the overworld map. In this section the player has a party of three characters (Shiro, Kumiko and Nagisa's friend named Asami) who can increase their states by winning battles and find items in treasure chests to use in battle. During battles the player can select various commands to attack enemies, including humorous actions such as a female party member flashing their underwear to weaken an enemy.","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DD3RTjsJvqY&ab_channel=%E3%83%92%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E5%90%9B"},"133025":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"cf864053-a89c-48a3-b18d-ed3f4579cc38.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9e28239-d29c-49ae-9a78-97608cb5152e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2561f55f-f7ee-4f47-9da7-4da550a593d4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eed4161f-cb6c-449a-b593-b22319c1c5be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8a7a3d65-879e-4d06-a634-7510f9839e27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"King & Balloon","Overview":"King & Balloon (キング & バルーン, Kingu & Barūn) is a fixed shooter arcade game which was released by Namco in 1980, and licensed to GamePlan for U.S. manufacture and distribution.

The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen.\n\nOn the screen, there will be two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one, but with a slight delay, and it stops at the same position as the first one.\n\nThe arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the balls to the empty section move the first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section. If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly.\n\nNow the goal is to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will fall into the pits, thus generating points for the player.\n\nIn the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the red line with its razor sharp claws, causing the balls to disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and resulting in the player losing a life.","Publisher":"Technopolis Soft","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lot_Lot"},"133037":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"e20d9f88-99be-4fff-afb1-ac44d29da821.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"aa471718-182b-4914-a183-b2f871c6a481.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bd424d2c-83b8-45ac-90f6-31f569eb16c2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"486e4c56-fe96-4cd9-9dd8-9d2de0c3e7bf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0d15e441-facd-475c-84e0-015d463e0ebb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Lunar Ball","Overview":"Lunar Ball is a futuristic pool simulation with space age balls and tables.

Enemies are attacked simply by bumping into them while holding the Space bar pressed.\n\nStory \n\nLocated in the south of the ocean is an island, where at one time resided a flower garden inhabited by three Goddesses of beauty named Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. However, the island was invaded by a Gorgon and her followers. The Goddesses entrusted the Twelve Constellations to the residents of the flower garden, but they were found by the Gorgon and their hearts were turned evil.\n\nThe sorrowful voices of the Goddesses reached Zeus in the world of the heaven, and his tears became rain that wetted the ground. Zeus called the Hero Perseus, and a sacred shield and sword were bestowed on him by the Goddess of Wisdom Athena and the Messager God Hermes. Perseus then headed of to the southern island.

The gameplay is for the most part similar to that of Gradius. The player-controlled ship can alternate between three main weapons: Missile, Double, and Laser. Extra weapons such as various types of lasers, napalm missiles, reflex ring, and back beam can be collected as power-ups and equipped. In addition, special power-ups can be acquired, their effects ranging from slowing down enemies to turning the Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount of time.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)"},"138200":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Gofer no Yabou: Episode II","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2653a620-bdf9-4287-adbc-252d8575a86d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"37ee1515-818b-4efe-a0ca-fd11b4e6b593.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"23444064-f894-4281-9ec2-c9ec3941701a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f4fe1f76-9614-4c86-b7a6-6bcbe68c394f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d95f5238-daf9-4565-8243-16d1ce3d58f1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6b4e33b2-4651-4f0f-9082-fa5febd52b14.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1824ce4-7ac4-4d7f-abb9-3ed9a727c270.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bbf5d64d-a644-4c37-bdd1-22d1092d584b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2f98e5e1-5aff-4d26-a138-613d329ff318.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b17a236-85b1-4c18-aede-b339233b3cb7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d8a78690-c9d3-453e-9e02-3abc0fa3b533.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f2f45b89-4a4b-41ab-b840-37738c242934.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8241fdd6-852f-49a0-8e97-888002b542cc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Nemesis 3: The Eve of Destruction","Overview":"Gofer no Yabou: Episode II (ゴーファーの野望エピソードII lit.

The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. \n\nIf a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. \n\nIf you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. \n\nAt other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X8IZheqcxsg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Ghostbusters_video_games#Ghostbusters_.28Activision.29"},"138874":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cazafantasmas II","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Foursfield","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fded1fc3-4f66-4bf1-95b6-4e5b6ec1afbc.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c7710a9b-62fa-401d-b1e6-7fdefe2754a2.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d39801d-3a0c-48fd-9644-ec614e7623f4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"29849b64-523d-4887-b561-c042061fa058.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ecadcb2a-e774-4610-b936-59b5040cf5d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1973cb7b-de7e-4325-8938-aaa224f3b500.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5f15683d-edfa-43f8-9c98-5069bb0ce06f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ghostbusters II","Overview":"The UK-produced adaptation of Ghostbusters II contains three action scenes based on the film:\n\nIn the first scene, the Ghostbusters must collect slime samples from the sewers. One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected.\n\nIn the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled.\n\nIn the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PGa_jKS3AMA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Ghostbusters_video_games#Ghostbusters_II_video_game"},"138875":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Opera Soft","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"97d0c7a4-ecc9-4412-89ad-88a4de7f2a0f.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"abcd3b34-29f5-409d-9948-add7e5516f46.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94b6be58-9d66-4d51-941d-6a6f95dfdddd.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7137b924-b1e3-463e-8438-88fd6438ff1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a946523-7233-49e6-b82a-71af6ae5334b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gonzzalezz","Overview":"Gonzzalezz is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain.

Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found:\nMagical Staff – Vanquishes RPG slimes.\nHoly Cross – Vanquishes ghosts.\nSacred Sword – Kills ogres.\nOnly one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels.\n\nThis adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseYear":2005},"139022":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Colpax","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b4e8a9ac-b158-4e5d-a285-dfb14102c40f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"365a2657-549a-4320-8403-644b36385da6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cfc41a80-ee62-4f96-aed2-cf86f8b403c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"454def5e-7780-4e0e-b638-4b21d44d15c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gyro Adventure","Publisher":"Colpax","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FXM1y9VCmlI"},"139023":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"bdf1c1d1-5180-4402-84ad-ab60363ef609.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"32a43cf5-20c8-4a87-84ac-320af931ee08.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36b0cf65-13cf-472c-9e28-2992157d92b1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e45fb60d-7523-432a-9ba5-e455f9f54a1e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f7919169-ef72-4084-9620-90a6d10dca0a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8d5ec725-ea34-4b24-8ecd-42926d5c14ed.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"81e450d3-b977-4265-9106-af8c9f018295.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"027448ec-f4ac-454d-ab89-03f2c6f03e92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a123560-45b7-4114-8288-a2f36cf0e177.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"H.E.R.O.","Overview":"There is trouble in the mines!

You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!).

Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.\n\nAs well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8b3_UUKDvsk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jack_the_Nipper_II:_In_Coconut_Capers"},"139896":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Tiburon","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Intelligent Design Ltd","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"67afcc7d-3363-410d-b0d8-2742e60f1372.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fd2a21aa-08fa-4af9-acdd-8a2e317f5379.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0c7c9a84-9def-4119-a5c5-228fd7d75981.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ec990535-4d1d-4886-8e40-772dd96d6871.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"98ab390f-b406-49c2-ad32-bd917284bc9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5b066531-afef-4273-bf5a-00ff7d1b38e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jaws","Overview":"As Amity Island's Police Chief Brodie, it is your responsibility to stop the lethal shark Jaws from killing the residents and tourists.

When a key is held down a gauge at the bottom of the screen begins to fill up.

The cavern is made up of various rocky ledges which Bugaboo may land on; however he can only stand on a flat area and, if a jump is mistimed, Bugaboo may end up on an angled area of rock, or miss the ledge altogether, which will cause him to fall straight down, landing on whatever is below.\n\nBugaboo may fall from any distance without dying. The only way for the player to lose a life is for Bugaboo to make contact with the large, yellow dragon which wanders around the cave. Bugaboo can escape the dragon by carefully leaping away, or by taking refuge inside one of the smaller caverns that are located around the play area.","Publisher":"Quicksilva","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q9fA7Cwjcxg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bugaboo_(The_Flea)"},"143194":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zigurat","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"647e8431-8401-461c-b24a-b45efd3c44f8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"55a52e97-2fb1-4563-b619-5d8f30b729cc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"65aa22c8-10e3-44d3-a7b5-576b6f776dea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"da2fc9ce-879b-458f-b2d0-9fea28d7e2e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kong's Revenge","Overview":"Kong's Revenge is an action game based on Donkey Kong.

Power squares are also used to enable the tennis ball to reach mystery spaces, tiles with question marks, which contain extra lives and bonus jumps which are used on bonus screens. Mystery spaces can also destroy the tennis ball, resulting in the loss of a life, through instant destruction or by freezing the ball in place while a missile flies across the play area and explodes.[2] The bonus screen is accessed every time a course is completed, it consists of mystery spaces which increase the player's score when bounced on for the player to receive. 40 bounces are allowed on each bonus screen, though this figure can be increased by the player uncovering more from mystery squares during the preceding course. Once all bounces are used or all of the mystery spaces are bounced on, play moves to the next course.[2] Bouncing on all mystery spaces awards the player 10,000 points as well as an extra life.[3]","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"146771":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Breakout"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ed11d237-75b6-45af-8a28-9c1ea0b7742e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1cae526a-6bde-47b8-a86c-cbe15ca4cce6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e140c2e9-f3d1-4fa9-8d38-6ad7562ffede.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f8dbc183-8fac-4a7e-b9ee-051bd090799a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6674ceff-1e71-4206-8971-10139591b207.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Break Out","Overview":"In Breakout, there is a wall of bricks along the top of the screen and your goal is to destroy the entire wall one brick at a time!

The protagonist (Geitor), controlled by the player, is in charge of pacifying the city. For this, you must go around the city to the headquarters of the Townsman to lead a revolt that would bring you to power and thus to the establishment of the peace in Metropolis. To achieve this your ultimate goal is eliminating the five nuclear tanks which are in possession of the evildoers of the city.\n\nThere are three races of thugs who will try to prevent you from reaching the headquarters of the Townsman: The Warriors of Death, leading experts in handling the sword and shield, as is our hero; The Dartfire, nasty-looking mutants who throw fireballs; and The Girlkiller, a gang of women who are as beautiful as aggressive beasts.","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"147705":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Made in Spain","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b9505d8b-ba97-4d60-848f-80012cd5b951.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"37854205-d33f-4f70-a9fd-a7b8c218b9e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9fedaf1d-25c8-43ba-bf2c-2dcde3689a78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"El Misterio del Nilo","Overview":"In this unofficial adaptation of the film \"The Jewel of the Nile\", three travelers have been captured by a dictatorial regime in an Arab country.

If you are caught, you are taken to a combat screen where the battle is automatically played out. Each round of combat uses a point of Strength. If you lose the round, you will be damaged which causes a reduction in Armor Class or Hit Points. You are then given the option of continuing combat. Alternatively, you may win the round and cause some amount of damage to your opponent related to Attack Points. If your opponent is killed, you will usually gain Experience points, although later in the game you will sometimes lose points for a kill.\n\nThe game is lost if your Strength or Hit Points are reduced below zero, but you win if you gain sufficiently high statistics and confront the dragon for the final battle.","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseDate":"1983-02-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"152801":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Teknopiste","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"bb426555-13a2-4738-86dd-de7c2ac649d9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40f8b300-877c-45ae-821d-f929a083fe94.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bomulus and the Lost Crown","Overview":"The third Bomulus game is a walk-and-pickup adventure based on the same general principle as Atari's original Adventure of moving between rooms in a castle, picking up objects and looking for a special item – in this case, it's a crown.

The long jump involves yet more joystick action, until you reach the touchboard. Then you need to press the jump button at the right time, optionally choosing jump angle.

Your path through the maze is briIIiantly portrayed on screen as if you were actually standing inside one of the labyrinth corridors, the maze walls looming up on either side.

Various objects, both dangerous and useful, lie around the maze, although the graphics are so indistinct it is hard to distinguish what is what. Food and water will increase your energy. Maze guardians or robots annihilate you on sight unless you get them with a laser gun first. Falling into dark pits also results in instant death. Infra-red viewer spectacles are essential for night time viewing as when the red sun sets, the maze turns dark blue and black making it virtually impossible to see. Heading for the sun, symbolised by a red cross, is the best plan.

It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart.

While Jai Alai is one of the names of the game, it is also often used to refer to the gameplay zone, the court or \"frontón\", specially around southwest USA.\n\nThe games are disputed between two teams (composed of two players each one), on a three-walled court. The ball is sent to the front wall where it rebounds and one member of the opposite team has to catch it and send back to the front wall. The ball can rebound on the left and back wall, but there's no right wall as in other related Basque ball sports. With a scoring system somewhat similar to the one of table tennis; in it, we will be able to score if we are in possession of the serve, while in the opposite case we will only be allowed to recover it.","Publisher":"Opera Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"153881":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"S.V.L.

Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.\n\nThe wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i1fsds0TDU0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pooyan"},"153970":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PSS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fcc7ba55-ed1f-415f-ba99-0886c95b9719.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea3387b3-d8d8-411e-9a2f-571b26db02bd.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"292e1ea7-0492-4ff5-8117-3103a489d88a.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8cc64cbe-7015-4a7b-9929-3d2f66a46c18.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Lazer Bykes","Overview":"This is one of those Tron-style games where you and an opponent, either human or computer-controled, ride light cycles in an arena.

There are obstacles in the road that you must avoid, either by going to the left or right or by jumping over them. Unlike Trailblazer, you can jump a whole lot, even to the point of virtually flying above the level. Not even then are you safe, though, since airplanes will attack you in the sky.\n\nThe ground has holes in it. If you miscalculate a leap, and fall into a black hole, you are dropped into something very much like Tempest, with your sphere moving across the outer edge of a space tunnel, shooting at the things that come out of it. If you fall into a water-filled hole, you fall through the road and find that it runs above a river. Here, you are attacked by fish, but luckily you can shoot back at them (something you cannot do on the ground). The next time there is a whole in the ground, you have a chance to resurface.

It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode. As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation. When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game.

Both United and the opposition can be player or computer-controlled. Players dribble automatically and shoot when the fire button is released - the strength of kick determined by the time fire was held down. In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick. In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX.

Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.\n\nThe four predefined characters are:\n\n    Syrela: a human female minstrel,\n    Podus: a male dwarf thief,\n    Gelth: a male elf wizard, and\n    Torlin: a male mi-orc ranger\n\nEach character has values for the following attributes, constitution, strength, knowledge, wisdom, dexterity, and appearance. When creating your own characters there is a maximum of 80 points can be assigned to these attributes with none having more than 20 points or less than 5.\n\nCharacter control is unusual and consists of abbreviated commands. The whole party moves as a single unit so to move North, South, East or West the player just has to type N, s, E, or W. When the party comes on an enemy the commands take the form\n\n    character: each character in the party is referred to by a number in the range 1 - 4\n    command: only the first two characters need to be typed\n    target: objects and enemies are referred to by letter\n\nSo when a monster is encountered typing 3 will select Gelth, typing AT will command Gelth to ATtack, and typing A will instruct Gelth to attack the first target. When the party acquires weapons it is possible to extend the command to specify the weapon to be used.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"154271":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nagi-P Soft","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"37072e67-20a0-452b-97ad-ab31122cccb1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"05e63870-a671-442d-b196-0a87705e4f8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b13b9e1a-6b1b-4cca-92e5-bdcff44d7bd6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mars II","Publisher":"Nagi-P Soft"},"154272":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Mask II"},{"Name":"MASK II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5356c89a-eafe-4d68-9c38-3addd705a391.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"048ded45-5d3e-476a-ba91-9471d56c8d6a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cbb830f3-4c32-490c-bcae-ea7b09617428.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"21146afe-00f7-4414-8a49-f593675a3c2a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"22ee2bd0-7a66-4561-8212-0cbff9a83b1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"98ea0738-2085-4e32-b8e5-306244c56690.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"MASK Two Two","Overview":"MASK II is a single player side scrolling shoot-em-up and is the second game in the M.A.S.K (Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) series that was based on a TV series \/ comic \/ toy license of the mid 1980's.

In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt has been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or never see his son alive again.\n\nMatt sets out for the moon where he must overcome the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son and steal a rocket back to earth. In his quest he is helped by special masks that give him special powers. For example one mask will give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, float across bodies of water, have temporary invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only carry four masks and can only use one mask at a time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or bullets, and this number is reduced each time the mask is used so eventually the mask will need replacing.\n\nAt the end of each level as Matt progresses to the next the player gets a code word. This codeword can be typed in when the game is re-loaded allowing the player to restart at the new level.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/etDmdQn0AwU"},"154301":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciels","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0c683e98-5540-4ea9-8993-d38e996cf9be.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e95b9c3-b0b7-4a24-85c3-ffb4e5406b8a.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1187a837-c697-4bf7-9557-09a3967cfc1a.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Maze Max","Overview":"Maze Max is a racing game similar to the arcade game Rally-X.

There is an enemy volcano which shoots boulders and cannot be harmed.\n\nIt is recommended to play the game at a slow pace as having many monsters at the screen at the same time can make the game very hard. At the end of a section, there are three gates. You do not need to kill all enemies and you can choose any gate to proceed to the second section of the first level.

Some of the goods may have already been promised to someone, and just need to be delivered. Other goods are expected, but have yet to be collected from the supplier. Goods can be bought and sold by visiting individual sellers, or the Winchester pub where a variety of wheeler-dealer types hang out. Each character present at the time is represented graphically in the top half of the screen and is associated with a number. By pressing that number (quickly, as there is a time limit) you can initiate conversation with that character. If you fail to select a character before the time limit, a random character may start speaking with you. All dialogue involves buying items from them (using text commands like \"I WANT\", \"HOW MUCH\", \"OFFER\") or selling items to them.\n\nOnce a deal has been agreed, the goods need to be moved. Your minder, Terry McCann can assist with this, and can be found at the Winchester, or in his flat (although he will tend to be uncooperative after working hours). He can be asked to collect or deliver items. If you are meeting with a dealer who might be upset with you because you have sold them poor quality merchandise, you can ask Terry to \"MINDER\" and he will accompany you to prevent violence (to you).

On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.\n\nIn each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.\n\nAs the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a \"boss\". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.\n\nItems can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized. Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.\n\nThe items in this game are:\n\n    Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.\n\n    Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!\n\n    Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.\n\n    Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.\n\n    Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.\n    Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!\n\n    Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.\n\n    Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ninja_JaJaMaru-kun"},"154740":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ninja-kun"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microcabin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8a056a38-be39-41e8-9fb3-414bb17c7d9c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"824d320b-44fe-460a-9c17-5a748a5ef378.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e7a8ed65-5bfa-4124-994e-8e4a2954b3ab.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"507be70b-1f0d-40a1-960c-86f182a955cf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ninja Kun","Overview":"Ninja-kun is a simple game featuring a ninja, plenty of treasures and patrolling guards.

The player has to protect the Golden Viking Helmet, which is at the bottom of the screen, from the attack of five different kinds of enemies. Each wave of enemies is composed of 5 of them. The enemies will appear in the top of the screen and will move toward the bottom of the screen; they can only move down (or diagonally down), and once they reach the bottom or the side of the screen they will reappear on the top or the opposite side. The Viking can move in all six directions, and will also reappear on the opposite side whenever he reaches the border. In order to attack, the Viking has to move inside the hexagon the enemy is in before the enemy moves against him first. As the enemies can only move downwards, approaching them from the 3 upper sides is advised.\n\nWhen an enemy dies, the corpse remains in the hexagon, making it impossible to move through it. Well placed corpses can function as a trap for other enemies, as they can only move downwards. The player can also get trapped by surrounding corpses. Once all 5 enemies are dead, a new wave of enemies comes. Each new wave has different enemies, in the following order: giants, octopuses, dragons, skeletons and bats. Once all waves are beaten, the game restarts from the first wave in a greater difficulty, while retaining the player's score. If the player dies or the Golden Viking Helmet is stolen, the game is over.\n\nThe game has 10 variations:\n\n    Game 0: 1 helmet, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\n    Game 1: 2 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\n    Game 2: 3 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\n    Game 3: Same as game 0, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\n    Game 4: As game 1, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\n    Game 5: As game 2, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\n    Game 6: 1 helmet, monsters will come from all directions: two monsters moving from top to bottom, and one each from left to right, from right to left and from the bottom to the top.

Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.\n\nThe game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.\n\nThe gameplay is mainly passive.

The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.\n\nThe control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle.

If a monster catches you then the computer screams 'Oh Shit!'.\n\nA non-offensive version of this game was released under the name Oh No!.","Publisher":"Eaglesoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_Nlcrh4reWc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oh_Shit!"},"155099":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ocean","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1f5eab0f-c448-49a5-96fd-5a04b0d56147.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"c7a789aa-197b-46cb-b1c0-a43b70a58f1a.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b9267057-4f1c-4675-a048-4abac07f3014.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c5f4b0e-60a5-4535-973f-13fc46f778a7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a6f53e8f-64b7-475d-acc1-823549124990.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4d334d3f-d870-4365-8f67-b0b2383b8600.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Operation Wolf","Overview":"You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?\n\nOperation Wolf is an arcade game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped \"rail-shooter\", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo\/grenades and healing items on the screen to \"pick them up\". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. \n\nYou'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. \n\nBosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"155108":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5af85b55-4117-464d-b1aa-f95738ab2f56.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"daef6db8-5de5-4cc8-99a5-d652016ca339.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10ff6a9d-e270-4157-b961-514e21d731c3.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c7c862d-9351-4a49-b3a4-94e780ba1186.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c94dcb79-cd93-4b73-99ec-0f3c03fc0b65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pastfinder","Overview":"Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. \n\nAt the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.\n\nFinally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.\n\nThe game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"155109":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A.C.G.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f766ddae-35b0-4743-8f7c-7008a4e555b7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"1941f249-9fce-4a1c-897e-81334a3eb743.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"76f35946-12ca-40f7-99ce-f2b636cc43ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5eb826d4-8016-4d33-9e4e-75e57faa0c0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pentagram","Overview":"Following the events of Knight Lore, where Sabreman got himself rid of the curse of the werewulf, he has been tasked to find the ancient magic Pentagram in the forest.

After spending all day yesterday putting up posters he has found out that his rival, Nasty Norville has messed them up.

These are split into three groups which are Kids Stuff, Smart Alec and Mensa Only and each level is harder than the last one but with a higher time limit.

You can attempt any level at any time and if you fail one then you can attempt it again later.\n\nThe game is viewed from behind Pat on his ladder with a small part of the poster shown and the screen scrolls when you move Pat in multiple directions.

In the bottom right corner is a sign for the toilet and if you press down you can see what the poster should look like, a press of the fire button shows the poster with the grid on it and finally another press of the fire button and you see what the poster is looking like at that moment. As you move the pieces around the screen you have to avoid missiles being thrown at you by Norville's henchmen and if you are hit by one you lose one of five lives. Failing to complete the level within the time limit and you fail the level and back to the level select screen.

After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. (\"giant-looking depredators\"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home.\n\nRescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads. In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun. The protagonist can also be ejected from the bathysphere in order to explore more strait entrances. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia: a jetpack to reach higher places; a portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis; a first-aid kit that can only be used once; and a mould to fabricate gold bars.There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat).\n\nThe player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level; once empty, the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them.\n\nIn the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures.\n\nThe final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset.\n\nThe game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.","Publisher":"Dinamic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"155226":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"True Software","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"7ab4489a-72d9-438e-b92d-e43e3b4246a3.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"418d048c-6fe1-4c49-ad78-e70a672cf35f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"240df0b3-70a8-490e-9f39-aea3d49708dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4d5fa173-8c09-4394-af53-3766eaf84d65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rescate en el Golfo","Overview":"The game is a classic beat-'em-up.\n\nA Jumbo jet full of passengers is hijacked by Iraqi terrorists and they are threatening to blow the plane up.\n\nOne of the passengers happens to be the girl friend of Ricky.

They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...\n\nOcean's version of RoboCop for 8-bit machines loosely adapts the Data East arcade game, with stages inspired by those from the coin-op, but also entirely new gameplay elements.\n\nIn most levels, RoboCop walks from left to right, shooting his gun at hordes of enemies that intend to kill him with bullets, chainsaws or their fists. Stages include the streets of Detroit (in two parts, based on the first level of the arcade), a drug factory (based on the fourth arcade level), and a junkyard (based on the third coin-op stage). Gun power-ups to collect include a rapid fire model, a three-way shot and a powerful flame cannon. Two levels end with boss fights against RoboCop's chief adversary ED-209. For some reason, ED is impervious to bullets and must be defeated using Robo's fists alone.\n\nNew challenges from the arcade include hostage scenarios: in these, seen from a first-person perspective, a criminal holds an innocent person. Moving crosshairs and firing precisely, RoboCop must take care to shoot only the criminal, not the civilian.\n\nAnother new game element requires some quick thinking: in a puzzle mode, a composite sketch of a suspect is presented and must be matched by choosing the correct parts (hair, chin, eyes, etc.) of the face within a tight time limit.","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"155284":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Double Brain!","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"49c8f619-becf-4294-9050-88d8bf56ad78.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"68287d95-46ea-4bf8-836a-059157f01b57.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"63e90d63-b1d3-48fd-8e84-6dd20e54a38f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8dd21001-fa0f-41a6-ba82-2c30b70f0360.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Roboy","Publisher":"Methodic Solutions","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"155285":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f60c8d5c-a509-491f-852a-e51e6eaf8f07.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"425f065c-1311-4caa-91e6-50bb9f8dc3cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0923309c-ed3b-447c-965a-f7ccee3aa5f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2f3836cc-484e-41a3-8361-de286cfc9413.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Rock n' Bolt","Overview":"Louie The constructor struts pieces to their location.

You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. \n\nThe twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g6Psxkj7oJA"},"155302":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dinamic","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1e4d1ecc-15aa-425f-9a1a-3ea7822370f5.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f84ef3ba-9f34-4a74-8674-2fa2635ed06e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f2d6da5f-e8e2-4044-990c-90ae064cc628.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"83ee0889-62dd-4096-9316-53e1f3cd5b70.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Satan","Overview":"Three magic scrolls must be found in the first part of the scrolling hack 'n' slash game, before you can make the journey to defeat your foes and rescue the other wizards in the second part.

Ken Uston was better known as a blackjack player and strategist, but he was also a video game author and the creator of Puzzle Panic. The game was originally released on the Commodore 64 and Atari 400\/800 in 1984, but later received an MSX port in 1986 by SystemSoft.\n\nPuzzle Panic is more of a minigame compilation than a defined puzzle game. There are eleven different \"levels\" that can be played, each of which is somehow a pattern based short puzzle game. These range from collecting certain items in a specific order, to reaching a set point under certain conditions.\n\nThe player begins the game in a room filled with question marks. There are two doors available, and walking into each one teleports the player to a new game (while the other brings the player to a new room, with two different doors; essentially a hub world). Within these games, there are several modes of difficulty to play through (accessed through three different doors within each game) before moving onto a different screen. All of the games can be accessed at anytime by bringing up the menu (by pressing F2).\n\nWhen the games are played in order rather than by the menu selection, they are (in reality) part of a larger puzzle, where each puzzle is actually represented by its own symbol, and interaction with the gates at the end of each is integral. In fact, the final puzzle requires the player to select the symbol that represents each level, as well as the order they were played in sequence. The final puzzle was known as \"Metasequence,\" Ken Uston's \"ultimate challenge.\" This larger puzzle was originally intended to be part of a real life contest, where players who managed to complete the puzzle in time (by August 31, 1984) won a trip to Atlantic City with Ken Uston.(Giant Bomb)","Publisher":"Computer War System Soft"},"155313":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"T&E Soft","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"57b81590-b687-49cd-9654-d03f8fc33503.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9ad663ac-bc4f-403a-bec8-e7dc9d62e6ba.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"586cd741-38c2-4852-a11a-16f3a8fc7af3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0c5dcb59-ac36-4c37-934e-5bf4ef862631.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fc483911-9155-44a0-83ec-f9116e7b4f8d.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pyramid Warp","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q1f0uNESENQ&ab_channel=FunCade64"},"155314":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nice Ideas","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d1df9e4f-decf-4519-b0a5-27936b3efe03.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f7f0edb-846f-4642-a7bb-4bb4d56f5a86.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"8a79813d-b3ce-44db-9fe1-91d05be2d870.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pyro-Man","Publisher":"Nice Ideas"},"155316":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eurosoft","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8b8e81d9-9930-402c-b845-cb3f39e79bcc.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04e01602-54e9-4abe-9959-136012151d35.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab1f2b34-1c26-4f17-8dfb-30fb7218acb6.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Quebert","Overview":"A  Q*Bert clone, not straying very far from the original implementation.

Before any power can be generated and the ship's scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.","Publisher":"Mastertronic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rasterscan"},"155349":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Enix","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"68a29063-49c3-4759-ae89-f5eec5f24d77.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Fharanx","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"155350":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Golgo 13 - Wolf's Nest","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"4dcffb26-6165-484a-9497-78b2d00395fc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"24779a40-1cf4-4e23-bcf6-d71a810d1ff7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0f495747-fb72-4a3c-a4ff-72dd3ca02b6d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c3e8813a-1360-453b-a8c2-7ccc9ae83dc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2a35db8b-84aa-44af-a763-80fb54604513.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Golgo 13: Okami no Su","Overview":"Adventure game based on the manga Golgo 13 by Takao Saito.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1984-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"155351":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"3e9ce9d6-0ce8-41ea-b094-4ec0763d279f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5678a8ca-d512-44dc-8077-9ccf03fee3bc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cbd5f866-14ad-4856-8603-e89c7e156d37.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Submarine Shooter","Overview":"Submarie Shooter is essentially a clone of Scramble but instead of flying in a space ship, you are underwater in a submarine battling alien sea creatures.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XS-zam64vOE"},"155352":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kogado","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"60c137a7-7369-44bf-9468-b8161efbd260.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c94926a0-3ac8-4b9a-841c-7e60d1fe94f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Psychic War: Cosmic Soldier 2","Overview":"The Century Parody is a powerful battleship on its way to the trade station Samar.

It is discovered that the old mining planet of Vestron contains a special kind of crystals which can be substituted for oil. Retrieving these crystals is imperative for Earth to be able to keep on fighting, so you are sent alone to recover the energy source from Vestron.\n\nThe game is made up of two different screens. On the static screen, you fly around in your space suit right above the surface, where crystals can be found. Pick up the crystals while avoiding the Amstradians, which luckily move back and forth in preset patterns. If you run the risk of a collision, you can press the space bar to activate your Asteroids style emergency teleport. This feature should be used only as a last-ditch effort, since you could just as well teleport straight into another enemy. You can travel up, left and right, to travel down you just let gravity do its job.\n\nAfter having retrieved the crystals on the static screen, you progress to a scrolling screen which takes you to the next crystal site. In order to get through this screen, you must avoid all the Amstradian ships which attack in a kamikaze fashion. Reflexes are a requirement, since the enemies move very quickly and track all your movements.","Publisher":"Players","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"156948":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Topo Soft","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fadd8220-be06-40cf-b1b7-c9578f953725.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5854a862-ebf9-4bda-81a8-bba44d3e5ffb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2d33bc2-2333-47ea-a268-f93649660c1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b144861f-91ec-4cfa-9570-083a1616bbb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Viaje al Centro de La Tierra","Overview":"In this Jules Verne inspired game you are gonna take a journey to the center of the earth.

One Spanish programmer took it upon himself to port the title to the humble MSX1, and released it as part of the MSXdev'03 contest. However, he never asked the then-defunct Compile for permission.\n\nThe game uses the exact same rules and even the same puzzles as the GBA original, as well as the original sprites. The graphics make good use of the limited power of the MSX, with many colours, and even renders the player character using multicolour sprites. Due to the limitations in the number of sprites that may be displayed, only one duck is responsible for shooting the blocks that fill in the picture that is to be completed for each level (the GBA original uses two ducks). While the game replicates the original gameplay, it lacks the storyline and does not display a coloured version of the completed pictures, something which would not fit into the 32K of memory used by the game. Instead, Guru Logic for the MSX1 concentrates on the puzzle gameplay that is central to the game, giving a clear impression of what Guru Logic Champ might have looked like had it been conceived ten years earlier.","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseYear":2003},"167016":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paxanga Soft","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"647992ec-7c9a-4c43-b155-98a3237817cd.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box -

The caves hold knowledge of a long extinct culture and the aim of the game is simply to discover all of that knowledge.\n\nThe player is in control of a saucer-like spaceship that is controlled from a side view perspective. Interaction with objects in the world, such as computers, sensors, fuel tanks and radars, is done by directing a beam onto them. To progress through the caves it is necessary to unlock doors by interacting with computers. The player is then given a puzzle that has to be solved, for example a math problem where the correct missing number has to be entered or a word with a letter missing. While moving around it is necessary to avoid bumping into the cave walls since the ship will take damage and when it is destroyed the game is over. Fuel is also limited and it is necessary to refuel at the fuel tanks.","Publisher":"N.V.

It was populated by magicians. At first they lived in peace, using magic to make the land prosper. But soon they were divided into two groups: good and evil. The forces of vice were strong, and the benevolent magicians need the help of a lone warrior to venture into the castle of the evil magicians and defeat them.\n\nLegendly Knight is a Korean-made action game with platforming elements. The game consists of single-screen stages, most of which contain platform structures. The player-controlled knight can jump and attack enemies. The goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen, including bosses which are fought one-on-one.\n\nThe knight has a health bar measured by hearts. He is armed with a small sword in the beginning, but later can find throwing weapons and magic spells. Items include armor, a scuba suit, health-restoring potions, and a ring that grants temporary invincibility. Keys must be obtained in order to access the boss room. All these items are invisible, and their exact location must be revealed by attacking spots in the stage. It is possible to find and equip glasses that would show the exact location of the keys.","Publisher":"Topia","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pD3Y-Jh-T1A"},"168013":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tetsuto Someya","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9ad9b881-2212-4cbd-8924-868272b0b406.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2e67d878-1fa7-4c34-a6ec-6ccdbd0c6c06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"070fccf3-9ece-4757-a4be-2d26425b6ba4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Legion","Publisher":"MSX Magazine (JP)","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ohnKMcyuXPU"},"168085":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Crappysoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"136475b2-b78f-44bd-9e8d-b227981a762b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d27e56ed-be03-4201-9abd-49e2a2d6f86c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2f54184d-9465-4567-9c5a-d0534bd9fc34.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1605b277-1b23-4273-b63a-595b0a700010.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"4daf031e-565c-430e-97d5-4596a6497137.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"716ee85c-84af-4747-b41a-b0d306226e08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"617bb562-a02b-4e99-968a-ca840b4029c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mars Lander","Publisher":"Crappysoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2006,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/www.generation-msx.nl\/software\/crappysoft\/mars-lander\/5200\/"},"168092":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"S.V.L.

Another feature in almost every level are special tiles that force the player to move in a fixed direction, though can be defeated if a block is placed in front of its directional output.\n\nThe goal is to collect four objects located around parts of each level. While the number objects never change, the theme of each the objects change after every two levels and include food, electronics, letters, weapons, and other forms of iconography.

You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your \"flight record\", which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward.\n\nWhen you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rAiSVL5QcAs"},"168576":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"スパーキー","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"aaa99c4a-46cc-4245-a618-388494c8c1b5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d9e79847-e8a6-4e03-a7f9-f3c157dbc53e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"03b627f1-14be-458f-939f-b9da8df819af.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"19e8b795-cde3-4994-80e4-e2a8aee55c2c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"422d441a-7687-4982-802f-fb63d1d54598.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"43e1bff0-73a0-4b1e-8c3a-6520c0459972.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1fcf8624-6e75-418f-8609-500ba830e538.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"ca979434-222e-4049-9ae6-99da08aae7f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"031aef87-5d62-4c46-a4bc-962257c70d51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9fd40cc2-5b21-47fc-ace5-8574a410dbc3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d0eda367-e944-42e4-906d-ea10e413f8cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sparkie","Overview":"Sparkie is a action game where you need to clear a level to get to the next.

There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.","Publisher":"Data Byte","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cUmH1Tr67CI"},"168587":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Bytebusters","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a249c060-a975-4496-b1c2-616ca95fd4a2.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"90dec827-218c-46ee-ac60-6eb3269349af.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"21d66b4b-1b76-4e0a-a3f3-ca0bebeb06bd.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be3acd0c-f619-491c-8d9e-d18cc5a98eeb.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"28a8cbe7-4bf9-4f7d-b411-20c77094a021.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c6c3e203-103b-4524-8376-0e7e30ef0229.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9605df54-77bc-49f5-b8e6-59e758e56fbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"812ad8d3-e0f0-44b2-91b6-9ff871cff27a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b3bb141a-44a1-4bcd-8db4-a33a261a0c15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Fighter","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"168588":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Isoco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9790515e-8af3-4d09-ae5f-3679045830eb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7da84cb3-eb4f-45fa-9b0a-fad7c402dc83.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"674f81f8-29ec-4562-9f81-ccfcd6c36509.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c2a3d44a-dab7-4868-81cf-ee66dae108bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d8eb8c43-fa8b-4989-9005-d677f163948d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a22bd323-9241-4a0b-876d-bcb262a82c2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Stepper","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=60IWxnpIq90"},"168590":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Satoshi Matsuoka","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2f8321fc-54d7-4d81-a8da-145d42fbe46f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e6e72be5-fde2-4c6b-bd1b-4b4b7e1bac51.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"541d3450-d8dd-4ce8-9920-489003bafe86.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"93f60e2e-8902-458e-8806-1aa11dd73272.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9bacdd5e-06b8-491b-a965-148779e8f1b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"93b1693c-7b07-461b-b57c-313556183dfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df24612e-62b9-4fee-ae09-89e17e6a435c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"64dfb2cb-910b-467d-a2df-0a1f2ba6b9f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Super Billiards","Overview":"Super Billiards is a pool simulations game.

One would expect half of Super Mario Bros 3 cloned, but only Mario's sprite and few others are ripped from that game. Everything else is redrawn, though mostly stolen from  Super Mario World. This makes for some awkward elements, like diagonal pipes realized as stairs.\n\n The game consists of 16 levels, which equals the number in both previous Super Boy games, but this time, they're entirely new. At the end of every level awaits a Hammer Brother, the final boss is the fat one from SMB3. Mario's(?) walking speed is extraordinarily slow, but even running he's not really fast. Extras are limited to those that are in since the first game. Quite everything looks like how the next Super Mario game would have turned out if Miyamoto wouldn't have had any more ideas. Seeing how almost everything in the game is newly pixeled, one cannot help but wonder why they didn't just create their own characters to begin with. Was the developer really so unimaginative? Other games by Zemina like Cyborg Z suggest differently.\n\n In other news, the hero of the series finally gets to rescue his first princess in the short ending","Publisher":"Zemina","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RhxeVPEouJY"},"168592":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"スーパードリンカー","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ample Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1d27e9c0-bb98-428e-95f4-fee0c3f19910.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b0c11f9c-d7af-414f-a9dd-845ab653e3d1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ae494c5d-0638-421a-a561-940624996a37.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1744ab17-b0ae-4bca-85b5-86f758cf8f05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"03290be1-fa8f-47cd-8756-228911ecc71a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Drinker","Overview":"You are in control of a man that loves to drink.

You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the \"EXTRA\" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word \"EXTRA\" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched. To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word \"EXTRA\" you will receive a bonus. On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.","Publisher":"Nidecom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Y7arsWJRZ_M"},"168598":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ocean","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0b0995c1-7ff7-4757-9c83-0c0ff6a2273a.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a65ddfee-7b1f-4e02-99d2-fe010fc293d5.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"563e9ef2-8774-4463-bbfa-82a997ca61d7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"289390c2-5474-4a49-94ce-cc204d70b0d2.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"757b6ac8-523f-4840-a62c-e8e4b251be92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e96bfbd1-627c-4618-831b-0527619bb2d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"448faaa0-1827-4af9-8ee7-009d333385b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tai-Pan","Overview":"You wish to make your fortune in China, in this adaptation of James Clavell's book.

His goal is to find one diamond hidden in a grain bag on each of four floors of the ship, before the wreck completely submerges beneath the waves. Of course, the ship is haunted. Spirit fires drift around the ship, and sometimes manifest as ghosts that will kill Tawara on contact. While the ghosts move slowly, Tawara's movement can be blocked by grain bags and larger spice barrels, which he needs to move before he can get anywhere. On the plus side, Tawara can throw grain bags at the ghosts to subdue them. Each throw costs energy though, and so only a limited number of throws are possible.\n\nIt is also possible for Tawara to explore the decks that are already underwater, but he has only a limited time before his oxygen runs out and he loses a life. On later levels, the submerged decks may be patrolled by sharks.

A lone warrior named Tritorn is the only one who can defeat the demon and restore peace.\n\nTritorn is, together with Dragon Slayer and Hydlide, an early progenitor of the action role-playing genre. Similarly to Xanadu, exploration is performed from a side view, with jumping and vertical areas, but no true platforming. Unlike the aforementioned games, it is necessary to press the action key to hit enemies rather than simply \"bumping\" into them.\n\nThe gameplay system is very simple, having no weapon or equipment management, monetary system, or friendly areas. The protagonist either attacks enemies with his sword or throws magic balls at them, which come in limited supply. Experience points are awarded for slaying enemies; though there is no clear indicator as to when the player character levels up, he gradually becomes stronger, tougher, and learns new abilities (e.g. walking faster).","Publisher":"XAIN Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=asErbHRYw3k"},"168793":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b169804c-4cf3-4bf4-933b-dabdaec10200.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"07e53d65-1737-4b71-afb5-b78a3f023548.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tuxy","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"168794":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infinite","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"507ee152-b9e6-40a9-972f-ce1db372de5f.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7755a151-6f5a-43a3-9155-8d52b8063dcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ef5eaa6e-9e18-420c-9896-beb1fc44bcf2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"603ae186-2938-46c4-ae07-29553ba9c566.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cd9e7f66-776e-4769-baf1-42d1de45de5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Universe: Unknown","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2005,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P8U0EoSg9es"},"168903":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"ワープ＆ワープ","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5bb6ee9f-a61b-47b4-8dec-bfcfe56712b5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6fc7dd7f-5b99-42de-b43b-0c6a4a6952c6.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"048cf555-4506-4da9-8e73-e0de08779907.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7d6d966e-c3d9-4baf-846b-0e3db1acab8b.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6888cc9-8f29-485d-82b6-7ecce2cfb298.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1653c8bf-8824-40f6-ba2a-828bbaab0deb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"38ac1b7d-08e3-4f3c-8c68-5d989f769253.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2b7a0b3a-0d16-4c0c-bccc-4b3fe4a606f4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3043ab9d-81a5-4c7a-96c8-3d162e91234f.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6084eb16-ff66-4926-8a15-cc3d03b1133b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"161a82c0-1aca-4bf1-8c53-7d936c1b237e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"35b8b3d5-de6f-4263-8b65-665077fe6e58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"039a7a04-6e3f-4278-b83d-2ac56d2b5065.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"42bb200e-a4f1-4c39-bf4b-eedff2cf6db8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Warp & Warp","Overview":"In this game you 're in control of a monster fighter.

In each level, you control forces defending a convoy of military equipment from marauding monsters. The first part of the level involves protecting a ship containing airplanes from flying saucers and sea-monsters. You control an aircraft which fires guns straight ahead when it is in the top half of the screen, and drops bombs when at the lower half of the screen. If you are hit, or if a plane from the ship is beamed-up by a saucer, or smashed by a monster, you lose a life. Once the ship has arrived at its destination, the second half of the level begins.\n\nThe second half of each level consists of a convoy of trucks moving towards the left of the screen, pursued by a giant monster from the TV series (such as Red King, a giant lizard that throws rocks, or Alien Baltan, a purple humanoid lobster-like creature). The progress of the convoy is shown at the bottom of the screen. Again, you start in a plane and can defend the convoy by attacking the monster's legs causing it to trip. Alternatively, you can land the plane ahead of the monster, and activate the beta capsule to summon Ultraman. The game then becomes a beat-em-up, where Ultraman can walk, jump, punch and kick the opponent while your monstrous opponent tries to do the same to you. If the monster destroys a truck, then you lose a life. But once you have given the trucks enough time to reach their destination, you are able to activate your spacium ray which permanently disables your opponents. The levels then repeat until you have run out of lives.","Publisher":"Bandai Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hLRGmfFvb2Q"},"180059":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"usebox.net","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"eddcdf37-091a-4538-a3f5-64ee2e6d1817.jpg","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d31208cf-9f2f-4daa-be7e-a4bea3faf3df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"105d44f3-a689-4daf-bbd5-b58e8118aacd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fb66ae1b-aa7d-46a1-a360-78f09c57842d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Night Knight","Overview":"Sir Bernard is cursed.

The player navigates a lone pre-made protagonist on a top-down overworld, accessing locations represented by icons, similarly to early Ultima games. As opposed to most other RPGs of the time, dungeons are viewed from an overhead perspective as well. In cities and palaces it is possible to talk to people, rest in inns and buy weapons, armor and items in shops.\n\nWhen wandering around in the wilderness or through dungeons, the player character encounters randomly appearing enemies. Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting menu options while fighting. It is possible to attack with the equipped weapon, cast one of the few available spells (using up some of the magic energy), use an item, or try to run. All the battles in the game are exclusively one-on-one. Killing monsters yields experience, and the player character's attributes improve automatically when he levels up.","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Quest_(video_game)"},"180772":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Hafanuda Koi Koi: Gostop Godori"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"RAM Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"2dab966f-c751-41c0-87f6-cc274835bc10.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bad9a625-a6e2-4452-8138-b1efa58b249e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0e45ebf2-1e92-40f0-85c0-24c768a3aef5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2179d4a8-55ed-4e53-8e5d-126bd7cfb986.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hanafuda Koikoi","Overview":"Koi-Koi is a traditional Japanese two-player card game. It is played with the hanafuda, which is a flower themed deck consisting of four cards in each of twelve suits corresponding to months of the year. The aim is to capture certain combinations, known as yaku, using cards played from the hand you are dealt, and picked up from the table.\n\nEach round starts with eight cards placed face up on the table, and eight dealt to each player. The first player must play a card to the table. If it matches the same suit as an existing table card, then both it and the played card are captured by that player. A new card is then drawn from the deck and immediately played to the table. Again, if this matches, the player captures that card, and it is then the opponent's move. The first player to make a yaku can choose to win the hand, or say \"Koi koi\" to continue the game. If a second yaku is completed before your opponent, you win double points. Otherwise, your opponent wins double points, and a new hand is dealt.\n\nIf no player completes a yaku when their cards run out, a point score is calculated from each player's captured cards and the player with the higher score wins the round and gains a point. The winner of the previous round then plays first in the next round. Play continues for 12 rounds (one for each month of the year), after which the player with the highest score wins.\n\nThis implementation of the game automatically detects when different yaku have been played, and does the scoring for you. It also has only one fairly low level of difficulty for the computer opponent, allowing a novice to win the game even if they imperfectly recognize the cards and can't remember all of the yaku.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"180782":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"جمع وطرح","Region":"Asia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Al Alamiah","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"5ddd60a3-0da6-4401-ac35-4b9d5885238b.JPG","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c2cdbc83-3598-435e-bb5a-8260dab1c7fd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7dd34b2d-7892-4fe3-8e70-077c96b18365.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"47eda23e-e4dd-43d4-9784-96880ab206cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Add & Subtract","Publisher":"Al Alamiah","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"180784":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Wonder Kid","Region":"World"},{"Name":"원더키드","Region":"Korea"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Open Production","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1406c44e-2517-4db4-ba29-03d79a3252f3.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"17e51ba0-34bf-4c28-8609-9941a93c3fd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4844ad2d-2073-4c18-8989-19c154f51829.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Adventure Kid","Overview":"Open's first game was most likely the finished version of Zemina's unreleased game Wonsiin 2, judging by the theme and the time of its release.

You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like \"lunar lander\" type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.\n\nAfter the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels.

The Worm in Paradise is set about 50 years after the events of the previous game in the trilogy, Return to Eden. The game relies on strict timing and a day\/night cycle (using a decimal clock with 10 100-minute hours) – return to your home before darkness falls, and don't expect robots to help with tasks which will not be finished in the day.

Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Shuttle:_A_Journey_into_Space"},"182016":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Chima Chima Private Eye","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c9858f79-d600-4d19-9b5d-fac8eee08dcb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6c4eb2ec-ee38-4f39-90a3-2d554822443d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"46b8540e-1280-4f82-a135-09a54422ed7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Yokai Tanken Chimachima","Overview":"Another winner of Bothtec's first programming contest, Youkai Tantei Chima Chima is an arcade game similar to Pac-Man.

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The game begins with the Fellowship of the Ring just having formed in Rivendell and the hobbit Frodo Baggins carrying the One Ring. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the ring bearer to the cracks of Mount Doom to destroy the ring. The game is lost if the ring bearer is killed or corrupted by the ring's influence or if Sauron's forces capture the city of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe game takes place in three different views. The Middle Earth Map displays the whole of the land on one screen, with the player's armies highlighted (unlike the 16-bit versions, enemy armies cannot be seen until encountered). A more detailed view is available in the Campaign Map. This displays much more detail of the land, showing rivers, roads, forests, mountains, towns, et cetera. Units are displayed as shield icons, representing either individual characters or larger military formations. If combat occurs, the Battle Screen is employed, which shows every individual soldier.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War_in_Middle_Earth"},"182277":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega","Images":[{"FileName":"c079917c-1cb2-4ee9-b4fe-ded2d8df68df.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e99e423-a3ce-426f-b7a4-494a7044000e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6f437844-ed48-4740-a412-7273e6ea42df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Bomb Jack","Overview":"This game was converted from the SG-1000 version of Bomb Jack.","Publisher":"MSX Files","ReleaseYear":2004},"182278":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"AG Software","Images":[{"FileName":"771caf00-7ef0-4775-a876-ea4aef3e2d9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2f2f3e76-dc77-4598-95a8-b22d5f1a5c08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Bomb Man","Publisher":"MSXdev","ReleaseYear":2005},"182356":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"The Breaker"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Juliet Software","Images":[{"FileName":"ed8ecd63-86d1-4833-b722-494bb3324a26.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"60ca10fe-883a-46ba-a824-058e68f0da36.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1882b4ec-b204-4105-b1d0-56a70d5c86a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f617513a-8bbc-4777-bd52-b496dc715aaf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Brick Breaker","Overview":"Our mission is to destroy all the walls that appear on screen up to a total of 25.

Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect.\n\nPower-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level.

One of the first computer games commercially released on that country, it has a parser inspired by the ones of Infocom and other companies, although not nearly as sophisticated (it has a small vocabulary of 40 or so verbs, it can't process chain commands, but understands pronouns). One unique characteristic of it is the requirement of accentuation on the Portuguese words. The game even provides special key combinations as shortcuts for accents to ensure compatibility with all systems.\n\nGiven the plot line, the gameplay has a strong emphasis on its survival aspect: even though it is written in first person, the game bizarrely complains about being thirsty (\"Hey, I'm thirsty!\"). Wild animals randomly appear to threaten the player, and must be dealt swiftly to avoid death.","Publisher":"Ciberne","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2IMjiE44DUI"},"182739":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mr. Micro","Genres":"Action; Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"67e45cd8-dc30-45ab-a539-dc9d08215fbb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d015ea64-dd07-4923-ae0d-dc8ee6ad78bb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"766c08f2-3ead-4bf7-8e51-9422964ba016.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3afc255b-a0a9-4659-9dba-f42f412de335.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"88d0f1c0-cf32-4fef-9650-4534305ffbff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ce51a1b2-9134-4481-8bdd-c7681bbf571d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Elite","Overview":"Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.\n\nElite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/qaTrl1mlCQE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elite_(video_game)"},"182864":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"5e8878d5-37bf-4f0a-ae80-3ab351cc4378.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6d3e22b3-4326-42fd-8275-1ab90846e42d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5c27fdc7-20c6-4c96-92db-d090f3836713.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"80eab3ca-676b-49c5-bd1a-31ec9c79b176.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Lancelot","Overview":"Travel back to the Age of Chivalry when knights were bold, galloping across the countryside and rescuing damsels in distress.

The gameplay is designed very similarly to the original game. The physics, however, are poorly programmed in comparison, and the items in the ? Blocks are completely random. Due to the older hardware, the scrolling is different to Super Mario Bros.. The scrolling moves in a very choppy fashion (Most, if not all MSX1 games had scrolling like this). The fireballs travel differently as compared with the ones from Super Mario Bros., and the Koopas also die in one hit which means that you can't kick their shells afterwards. Most of the time the area with the HUD can't be accessed, apart from the end of each level when you jump on the flag. Also notable is that this game has only four worlds, half that of Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe time given for each level also reduces throughout the game, with the first two worlds having 280 seconds for each level, the third having 260 and the final world having 200. The ending omits Princess Peach (or an expy thereof) and instead replaces her with the message \"To be continued\", indicating that a sequel would be made.\n\nThe graphics could be considered accurate given the limitations of the MSX1, with most of the graphics ripped from Super Mario Bros. and downgraded somewhat, with the exception of the title screen which is redrawn and Lakitu which has been replaced with a ghost. The music is interpreted from the original game, although the soundtrack has been cut down considereably (the game only has the overworld and underworld themes) and the compositions themselves are inaccurate. The sound effects are crude when compared with the original game.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"182870":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tokuma Shoten Publishing Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"061aff00-aab6-4ee6-8e8c-03c83a7c8708.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eb29424d-f530-4e8a-8c04-a57cdbfa6741.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b4cd5b16-bfed-4309-a090-bf804fa12481.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"4936af43-80b4-4704-a090-a3afb6440f5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"03c203c6-2a0c-4469-b589-ea17a5406f1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fandom Library #2","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten Publishing","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"182879":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"ＭＳＸ－２１","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"MSX-21"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"febad843-979b-4e36-90d1-39432853e861.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"52235f1f-b8b9-4f8b-8e7b-00c254102bb2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"117ed129-90b3-4388-90b2-3c28f3418cf5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c4cb6054-1f95-4e6d-bd11-aadfe274ae5b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"003b7fd4-c9b7-4fe8-a461-62b4da3ded24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"MSX 21","Overview":"A casino gambling card game.","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"182884":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"a9ffa8ad-f25e-44d8-8759-58dd85680442.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b37ef9b5-e92e-4ff5-b2d3-f9fc5a1ebc85.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c5e2e860-9601-4040-80d9-70499d227ee2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c66c6c0e-3e2c-4141-ba13-38655ac5a666.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"F-15 Strike Eagle","Overview":"The seven missions featured in this simulation of F-15 flight are all real-life missions the plane was originally used in.

It means that your success will depend on whether you have a good shot or not. Game options will be selected with a shot as well.\n\nThis game consists of two parts which can be played independently, all of being related to aim shooting. The second part does include a 1 or 2 players mode.\n\nIn the first part you will have to shot at plates flying in the air, accounting for a total of 12, if you hit at least 6 the you will pass to the next round of this first part. You have 3 shots for every two plates, so you have to be effective on a regular basis. Once you have passed this round, you will have to aim at a total of 7 targets, your goal is to hit at least 3 of them, here you only have one shot available for each objective. If you are lucky enough, the stage will be restarted with increased difficulty.\n\nIn the second part of the game your objective will be to protect a juicy cooked chicken to be mercilessly attacked by spiders or voracious wasps that emerge from everywhere. Your mission would be to shot at them before they can absorb its substance till just leaving the bones. But it will not be easy, as time goes on insects will be more numerous, so if you find it pertinent, you can request the help from a second player.

The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding. You could also use a help option which would display information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible.

The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster.

Here, the graphical style changes into a more technological one than the natural caves earlier on.\n\nThe fifth section is equally cramped, but with steep shafts which must be descended into or ascended from with precision, due to the speed at which you are moving.\n\nFinally, the sixth section is an infinite loop where you must bomb a single enemy construction before you run out of fuel.","Publisher":"Livewire","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"188939":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Bytebusters","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"1fa24486-7259-426b-8b42-b11fa321bd65.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"711f5b36-1784-4d40-9c98-5e981326e8bf.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5f76e6d9-63fe-4c0e-ad3d-3526e9f72d30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fb499301-4ef0-4b2c-b3d6-9927acf40a33.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sky Vision","Publisher":"System 4","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"188940":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b860f822-0b5b-41c1-bd05-ea9a96484083.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ef7b245-6565-43ec-aa4e-e8137afaa983.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e3274d21-04e8-4b4c-a72b-bc4ce2235637.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Skyhawk","Overview":"Skyhawk is a two-way side-scrolling shooter. Players fly a jet across a looping area and must shoot down attacking aircraft. A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position.

Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them.

The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.\n\nAcquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits.

Also, there will also appear some objects that will recharge your ammunition.","Publisher":"Opera Soft S.A.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"188987":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sein Soft","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"1a510aba-e270-43f2-945a-8810696d81cc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"36e84a9e-7ce4-4ebf-ab76-a2e840ec68d2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"34515474-a4c9-477d-8364-a2d0541e008e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9c539596-afe0-498a-b992-5355c9a8a1bd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eb175ba8-79e9-4c2b-bdb7-cf6a756011e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ce3a286b-455f-44ee-ab2e-b75e9d14bb78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Triton","Overview":"Everything was peaceful on the island of Rwanda, until the evil demon lord Pay Valusa invaded it, sending hordes of monsters to do his bidding. A lone warrior named Tritorn is the only one who can defeat the demon and restore peace.\n\nTriton is, together with Dragon Slayer and Hydlide, an early progenitor of the action role-playing genre. Similarly to Xanadu, exploration is performed from a side view, with jumping and vertical areas, but no true platforming. Unlike the aforementioned games, it is necessary to press the action key to hit enemies rather than simply \"bumping\" into them.\n\nThe gameplay system is very simple, having no weapon or equipment management, monetary system, or friendly areas. The protagonist either attacks enemies with his sword or throws magic balls at them, which come in limited supply. Experience points are awarded for slaying enemies; though there is no clear indicator as to when the player character levels up, he gradually becomes stronger, tougher, and learns new abilities (e.g. walking faster).","Publisher":"Sein Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"188988":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Delta Software, S.L.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"491fc7f9-ae69-4373-a698-250cdfaaf215.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d1bb99dd-1769-4819-a34b-bf745a87b1a0.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"00859e88-915c-454d-8128-44ee953698f5.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"beb6b44a-c5ab-4eaf-8528-2d8cc0dfbd95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0b10f0ea-4830-4e72-a461-2081ee26f4ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tuma-7","Publisher":"Delta Software S.L.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ueJtUHZQ6GY"},"188989":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Artic Computing","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"92a519cc-ecc9-4681-8e9d-6de0d1bb739a.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Turbo Chess","Publisher":"Discovery Informatic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"188990":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Martech Games Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0f3dd927-b102-4ae3-8738-500cddffdfc8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ad62603c-0102-42a0-b494-db0c2e902d60.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c43e73e3-edf2-42d9-aa36-6057a25061e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"488751a2-a600-479e-a2e8-4470a53f728b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ca6c1da4-2f28-4151-a321-d7a6a09d3460.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Uchi Mata","Overview":"Uchi Mata is a unique tournament-based Judo fighting game in which you play as a judoka in the ultimate tournament.\n\nThe game is played from a non-scrolling side view.

Instead, your attack command puts you in a fighting stance that allows you to input a series of directional moves. That, combined with the correct feet placement of both fighters (which can be seen in a helpful window) allows you to unleash specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form the basis of the combat in the game.

After the defeat in the Matrix wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective to eliminate every single droid.\n\nGameplay is similar to Gridrunner. Like in Centipede, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen and the player have to shoot them before they reach the ship. There's also the zapper, a vertically moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it will die.\n\nThe enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you'll also fight furry animals like camels and goats.\n\nNew in Voidrunner is that you don't just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming in from behind.","Publisher":"M.A.D.

Gorf is a game that consists of five levels:\n\n    The first level called Astro Battles has the player's ship behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.\n\n    The second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.\n\n\n    The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.\n\n\n    The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.\n\n\n    The fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.\n\n\nFinishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.","Publisher":"GDX","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2015},"197428":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"N.I.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a0844c10-4f7b-41af-9111-3770e7ce1ff5.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf0fbeb0-789e-44d6-823f-f983a4fbd069.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4ab29ee7-77dc-47c2-9a05-6e07e8c6767c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Green Cat Chronicle","Overview":"You are a cat and your object is to continue defeating the enemies with bubbles.
