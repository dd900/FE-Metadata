{"Name":"Sega Naomi 2","Games":[{"DatabaseID":125590,"Name":"Beach Spikers","ReleaseYear":"2001","Overview":"Based on the sport of beach volleyball, the game revolves around two-on-two matches where a volleyball is hit back and forth over a net until one side allows the ball to touch the ground. Similar to Sega's Virtua sports games, most of the gameplay in Beach Spikers is based around the concept of \"charging\" the strength of moves, judged by how long the button is held prior to release at the point of which the move is executed. There is a button for setting (passing) and a button for rallying (sending the ball over the net) which, combined with how long the button is held to determine strength, is the basis for the way the entire game is played.\n\nThere are two modes to choose from: Arcade Mode and World Tour mode. Arcade mode is a basic progression through a series of AI opponents, and in the multiplayer portion of Arcade Mode, it is head-to-head matches for up to four human players. In World Tour mode, the player take a user-created team through a tournament, earning points as you go that allow you to increase the stats of your players and also unlock special teams and players, including one based on the character Ulala from Sega's Space Channel 5 series.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ShzvRawPbI","Platform":"Sega Naomi 2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Sega AM2","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"da7ee6cb-df99-424c-ac67-fc545ee92327.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"52383b08-cdba-4343-b763-eb1c3715638f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"7a100fe6-5cf6-488c-a004-37c2511b03f9.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"273c0600-9aa3-4f8b-9aab-ab5f3ceda2aa.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"17f7a2d8-6765-4030-ad21-0e1d0e5dfda2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"eb770bed-db02-4a77-aae6-756438a80f9a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"136598d2-256c-4364-9ee3-bbaed56ebc05.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"79a17351-861f-4ee2-a417-7c1abb9cda52.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"abf1f708-ad8f-40bb-866f-f9c05b411086.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125590,"FileName":"7480d847-2793-4dd2-8d69-f303e9c2863c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":125590,"AlternateName":"Beach Spikers: Virtua Beach Volleyball","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":36060,"Name":"Club Kart Prize","ReleaseYear":"2003","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qr819AUqy0","Platform":"Sega Naomi 2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":36060,"FileName":"6f8d6262-77f8-45f0-8ea5-a022a6d682d1.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":36060,"FileName":"aaa591eb-96c9-4fbb-acf6-bf2a6a0c9856.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":36060,"FileName":"fcab133b-c81a-4d37-aad2-28ddf64a52da.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":36060,"AlternateName":"Club Kart Prize Ver.
