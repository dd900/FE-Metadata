The latter sees itself as the successor state to the malevolent Badds, also known as the Nazz. One day, the Federation discovers that the Imperial leader Generalissimo Killt decides to complete an unfinished project codenamed \"Albatros\" and started by the Badds. The Federation sends their hero Super Joe to stop the Empire's plans, but he is captured. Ladd Spencer, a member of the special FF Battalion, is dispatched to rescue Super Joe and uncover the enemy's secrets.\n\nThis version of Bionic Commando is loosely based on the original arcade game and its computer ports, having different levels and plot. The protagonist is a soldier with a bionic arm that extends and contracts. His arm allows him to grab on to fixed objects to swing around and climb up platforms, which is the only way to do so due to the lack of a jumping ability. The arm also grabs opponents and pulls them towards the player character.\n\nAfter most levels the Bionic Commando will receive items. Often these items are required to successfully complete other levels. Additionally, each level will require a different colored communicator in order to make sense of message traffic.","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0DdCulJ5uc4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bionic_Commando_(NES_video_game)"},"112":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"730f6ee5-0af7-4596-b058-c5be0a9bcb0a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer -

Super Spike V'Ball \/ Nintendo World Cup was a pack-in game included with the Nintendo Entertainment System Sports Set. The package included a standard NES console, four game controllers, and the Four Score Multiplayer Adapter. The cart included two games developed by Technos: # Super Spike V'Ball, a two-on-two beach volleyball game where you played on a tournament, ending with the world championship. The game supported up to four players on one match at a time; # Nintendo World Cup, a soccer game where you (and a friend) chose to represent a team and played several matches until you won the World Cup. The game featured little to no rules, which means that you could hit your opponents as much as you want, without fear of the Ref getting in the way.

Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.\n\nSince the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point.\n\nOther rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.\n\nIn a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.","Publisher":"Nintendo of America Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5LUyTv9j1TM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/10-Yard_Fight"},"321":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo R&D1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4aadf429-34b4-45d4-9020-8b78b07dee6b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"71ae2ed4-2673-4d4d-8ede-cd635adebfa2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3353a3a2-704c-45bb-8dd8-b363210941e3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7ba73835-2ebc-4584-96cd-087f6bdb8cda.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3a78b174-5685-48e6-983a-6adbeeec5408.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"614d245c-02a6-4207-8c76-760d3fe245bc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"101138aa-0825-4355-b3dd-0f0edee49190.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6065c5f6-3b45-4df7-88f8-d0bbe9df6b8d.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"38a78444-b49a-4afa-990c-45bfd9438201.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7f47bc05-51f1-497f-bc77-fbf91f7a29bf.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"288497e9-6da2-4e46-a401-1af508b22100.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"65d74bfb-c913-41c8-bfcc-07453080bee9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6e48a05c-b9e6-462a-a70d-5fc3e66a7331.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"80376dff-2c54-4673-b460-4585ba2597a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"64f1eacc-b77e-40a4-b1f5-abcbfed3120b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wrecking Crew","Overview":"This amazing Nintendo Programmable game lets you design your own building, place obstacles wherever you want them, and then blow everything to smithereens!

Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite. But lose, and you might as well turn in your jockstrap and joystick.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"325":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Hyper Olympic","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Track & Field in Barcelona","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"6f917af2-3b5e-4b2f-9fc6-1a6da0d9b759.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c09eb8e9-9d02-4f13-9a4e-9492b6eb08fe.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"33e9580c-9a8f-4264-aa5b-150a4e212d07.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8e1ed559-abdf-45a0-ae5a-62a67bb967ac.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fcbd0135-5c44-4561-a709-ee6018d5497f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"844a1b46-82dd-47da-a5f8-d2efe7cf6a38.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f819fada-cca6-423e-b0c7-0e6d84421fac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eda519d9-566f-42e2-a4c6-2a907b53b2ab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61674691-0ed8-4edf-8400-2411932f1a58.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"b4fe5acf-2033-4717-91d1-73c9f9b559b0.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"c2ac2253-011a-4926-88c9-02b080431f74.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8c3adc69-0ea0-403e-8653-c74a2321c938.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a1d7fa30-3948-4c45-8e3e-ffedd7c3bf45.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2dc475c9-792e-47c1-a399-72941244d04d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fbbde41b-56c9-41c9-a39a-12494f0e3456.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5a580c4e-5b5d-42b9-9573-32f4748d8803.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"66e337e6-3f7e-4e2a-ad22-42c070116812.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7c2dfa21-9eed-45c2-9a5b-7a40d0746f3a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f48e8d7c-abb1-4ed1-858c-ca5beb10cf42.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"570b5e1f-4635-413c-9ae4-4bc592d36099.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a44a479f-30d1-4eba-b96f-5d3f0b88c4b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5702d834-86ff-4f18-9cc4-97ab6c983c8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Track & Field","Overview":"This ain't no 20-minute workout.

As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent (who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appears in The Terminator) asks two street-smart brawlers, named Blade and Striker: \"President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?\", which this quote became an infamous meme and is often lampooned on the Internet. In the Japanese version, however, the words are completely different. After they heard that, the Bad Dudes confirmed it by pursuing the DragonNinja through the city streets, highway, sewers, transport train, forest, cave and into the secret ninja base, in order to save President Ronnie.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bad_Dudes_Vs._DragonNinja"},"333":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Nintendo R&D1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6cdc1de4-d32c-415b-8fc6-7c5f9231398f.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"910e9a45-642c-47c1-93bb-b66af4daac8a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5ae2f9ec-464c-456e-99dc-9dc222aa172a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3e5c9406-b080-46a7-9597-cb8d359b367a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4a1a33c3-783a-46e9-a87a-c5b823de2430.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"15f78dae-40d3-4d5c-af6a-388a3e1c7e5c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6d5fa253-f05f-4578-9e54-07db7253756c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49373f16-473a-4634-bd90-b8a48ea289df.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f443328-57aa-4033-9c63-6af1a3de28e6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"175c2d94-5147-4721-b624-40a675eea7ea.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"bd591a2f-f1a8-4971-968d-0efe32de0fc3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"01cc53cd-ab5d-474b-b993-dc64846c492f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9e05082f-a194-4caf-ae77-5002218e3724.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6b22ce86-1868-4f0e-8038-16a8c8fbece5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"52e848be-1e17-4f63-b26a-5a67bf653d8d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"69bfd8a0-5da4-465d-b429-c5e662b08f63.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4cb090c2-f9f8-413f-8434-0ef4b5eb89b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"9bcd7411-6fdd-4789-b84e-4018a54cc525.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9fc79a04-a933-4c33-871e-c0df836bc5aa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Balloon Fight","Overview":"You'll need lightning-fast reactions to win this battle in the sky!\n\nTake to the skies!

And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castlevania_II:_Simon%27s_Quest"},"339":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Akumajou Densetsu: Legend of Demon Castle"},{"AlternateName":"Akumajou Densetsu","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f6328c8f-87c6-427f-86af-9b2e5a6c5b9d.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2ceff751-60cd-42a0-ad30-ef922b30074a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ac727c49-c0ef-4298-aa18-7ed6d658cd74.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"88c014b9-ee1f-4842-9e16-f2fe5001c322.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e5cf2bac-c1a6-43ba-a02c-b87250842a5d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"991a980e-0235-47d6-9fe6-76d9815ba506.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1caaeaf6-df62-4579-b4c6-1b68cc368062.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"72cf8f65-61c9-42e5-9a2d-d7c55f74272f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c1fa7940-7dd0-4c71-b4d7-c1ee05c924bd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9544434c-71e8-4ba6-b776-f57f3d99a170.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4bc9d51b-3f9c-4023-ba77-e9471ee881ad.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"1b62e51d-f679-4bb5-8a5e-73cac94496e0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5eca9326-e920-4f6c-bed7-190afc93ee4f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f80512d5-3aad-45ed-931f-9e7ed206cea8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"60ee9fe8-e6cc-4fd6-a167-edbdf8a2d582.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9788f440-a028-4f4b-9db7-fb35b4cb46c4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"373ec97f-c5b2-4c48-8224-39fafccb56e0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e8b518b7-4efc-48c6-a5d7-43a770ba1b91.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f3d67854-6bff-4254-8152-94431b1a2386.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d37f938a-7103-48cf-bcaf-cade7004381e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c9f98d11-245d-4d43-9e89-73d37f55ab97.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"445c32bd-c280-4d06-b0f0-4db2ecb0d9a8.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3d7bfd5d-56f2-4546-a650-0e934c3b30bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b53b8fa9-3302-4ad6-b88b-841274127811.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0fe5a9c4-c9d0-4457-b839-3a71f5d0f890.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4639b2a1-c7af-4260-a661-460f8c315d83.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"180adf65-6ff7-4df5-9f1c-798a3de31798.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bda79f81-6ef8-440d-affe-0322ec1e549b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4cb30de4-0559-4220-bdc6-903663f69588.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse","Overview":"Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal.

You had better hurry though, it's getting late and you can feel your eyelids getting heavier and heavier by the minute.","Publisher":"LJN","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O_N7Q4R4crw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_%28video_game%29"},"1020":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Doragon obu Fureimu","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Dragons of Flame","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atelier Double","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"ea474326-39f2-4210-90bb-afeeecd034e4.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0d8b7e4d-c7b4-480d-96c4-f75343b8136e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"706103db-0a32-4cc6-b43f-17da9d32411e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"297852e0-1058-4de1-891b-01a0f2f91925.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dfb06915-a20f-4f0e-be4f-a9e5e3334196.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1c269785-22df-49cd-92ef-ce527a98d29c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2313b3ea-c56c-4f61-ab08-2ab7b1164d96.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"91ac9502-1a5d-499b-a170-980e62d9872d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73af1b4f-3eb4-4d25-85f4-13fb2a9a4c22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"218bfc4a-a302-41a0-be7c-866c051d20a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"13e71529-b9d9-446b-8c52-5e404578c04e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Dragons of Flame","Overview":"The dragonmen have taken Solace.

The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.\n\nA big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FDj-wouTTF8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adventure_Island_II"},"1024":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8c6da0d2-3d0b-4749-aa97-f5ee35f30219.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5fb22732-d8bc-4ec4-881f-e7067060e574.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"40571434-fc66-4319-a28a-090af3a5e702.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f7276d09-c2b2-420e-b788-1161499784b2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"008f0575-bac8-4a75-99aa-6442f3beedb3.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0b7e58c5-3834-4963-88fd-47999231b4de.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d2657daf-9547-4d48-a720-edca3d2a2ba4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1d91437-ea8b-4cd5-b53d-92cc35abedb1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4c0f3cd1-f0e4-4444-8462-7da02cce81b5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c17b64d-1953-4f51-8b66-7314570056ab.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"13f96aa2-bae9-4f15-8ec2-8a8e5cabee01.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"144d232d-73a6-4a16-8a94-b8f4ddcc8c7d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2ea57732-2d80-4330-8032-93af0a9b0540.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Adventures in the Magic Kingdom","Overview":"This is your ticket to breath-taking Adventures in the Magic Kingdom!\n\nJoin the exciting adventures as you search through the Magic Kingdom for the six silver keys that will unlock the Enchanted Castle.

The controls are fairly simple: the A Button makes Astyanax jump, the B Button will attack with an axe called Bash, and a combination of up and attack will perform a special magic attack. The game also contains a few role-playing elements, such as weapons upgrades. It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack. If one attacks rapidly, one's hits will do little damage, much unlike most games where a rapid succession of hits would all be equally damaging. A very similar system would be used in Secret of Mana some years later.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o2s96h8Abrg"},"1030":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beam Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"42d34726-4ef9-4b99-88e1-69414cc3fcad.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"01f6c8b7-0c56-4230-8518-a0ae20bf18ee.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9649590a-5f4e-4b46-b048-a8b33fb4941e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e93d4d98-743f-49bd-ba58-4a28c9ba3967.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c5c1fa3a-b880-464a-9a3e-5f3c545192f5.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"41ef1a28-475b-48d4-8315-8bc818786c48.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"078e48be-8d06-4dcf-ba08-b88d986ce41c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"31fd2ce6-f4ef-49ce-9a13-37918a518db0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"009189f1-a424-4f66-a23b-844ad78aa589.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"99da9385-1e0e-4fc8-bfb9-95f2beb9c975.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"77f4d559-2dab-4c4c-a1d1-e0d7db0f740d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"94dd25ee-944e-48df-8a04-7dc9705335b9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"14a21aa9-a994-468c-b627-a555e5130bfa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Back to the Future","Overview":"You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High.

This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses.\n\nBoss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.\n\nLevels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers.

Her beauty and grace were known throughout the land - especially to Mad Mizer, the Dark Lord of the grim Groken Castle high in the Forbidden Mountains. He had vowed to make the Princess his queen; and so, one terrible day, he sent his ghoulish helpers to capture her, and she was carried off and imprisoned in one of the hundred miserable rooms of Groken Castle.\n\nNews of the kidnapping spread throughout the kingdom, and many courageous young men braved the perils of Groken Castle in an attempt to rescue the Princess - only to become hopelessly lost in the complicated maze of rooms, ensnared in one of the many treacherous traps, or foiled by Mad Mizer's deadly servants.\n\nFinally the news reached the worthy Prince Rafael, who had long loved the Princess from afar.

Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.\n\nThere are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ilsx3wm1nVY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Adventures_of_Gilligan's_Island"},"1294":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Moero!!

However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length.

The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to \"bump\" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.","Publisher":"FCI","ReleaseDate":"1986-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"1326":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"敲冰块","Region":"China"},{"AlternateName":"アイスクライマー","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"dc8db24e-1a21-4ea4-8a2d-f7cfbc135355.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c6522dd2-d644-456c-b553-4ec36cb08ace.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"825b5203-81e7-484a-8c4f-5ba1820230de.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"777fe715-4d0e-40ab-836b-33d0e3efe6f9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"623d1390-9206-4db4-85b2-77e1482185e8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"24c828df-4436-4c7d-8974-6770cfb41bb8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"335880f8-1db7-4b9c-b918-0d168d01fec5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"03077ea9-aff8-4ef2-9fa0-af774cac1b80.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e9403ce-25ac-42b0-9b87-cbecdf61405e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2d2d2d9e-94ab-43c9-96f6-5c2e1418948f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f56506d8-893a-449f-a51a-19b583dddc1e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"028deacb-cbae-4e4b-b625-658e643aecf9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fe7a4aad-c67f-4ddb-82ad-2c785b3c484c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"045d5800-989c-4bcd-9668-af30a204a5d3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e79ee46e-f47f-4fa7-97e2-1f8eb5cd3c51.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"268b7c75-7fab-4e96-b8ee-bf0b0aadcbdf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e059bdeb-b3db-4034-8f13-b4515b7cc2c5.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4e7a5967-a4fc-43ac-9ced-7132cdedb568.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"467e22f3-518a-4d61-aec9-1dbc94e6db13.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"44f9eca8-7f59-449c-a23d-9f2bf4351016.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9ea9fe8a-23ca-4fd8-beaf-b691a54ede1d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ice Climber","Overview":"It's only you and an ice hammer as you make your way to the top of the mountain!\n\nIf you can break through 8 levels of treacherous arctic ice, you'll reach the top of the mountain!

There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.\n\nThe play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.\n\nThere are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.\n\nThere are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"1989-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v78pySyiGOc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tecmo_Bowl"},"1384":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"兔宝宝大冒险","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b31747f1-4831-4ec4-ac5e-e7ddc5954550.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b19e78b2-bbd7-4791-8f71-56c5f844220e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0cf75553-3bad-4785-a87f-c7f2c5f7b21a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5b902f8a-23b4-48dc-a703-d2fbcac9cbd4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3ea60036-583a-4d1e-9497-0d18920679e4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a6f12a48-4c89-4299-8e73-281be194775a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"90b77c38-4a0b-437d-a52b-b0ffbd9670bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c9035809-dba0-4843-87fc-3c6c6147e0b5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6182030a-2b37-462a-b652-cc57e3c01e03.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"51cdae69-4fbb-4fd9-bc05-443dafa93f6a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e384bac2-b963-4584-8ee4-46bf3cda0039.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"24835eb2-3988-42ee-a75a-6d1aec2281f1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tiny Toon Adventures","Overview":"These Tiny Toons have big problems.

The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.","Publisher":"American Game Cartridges","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"1415":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data East","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"35c09328-02a0-41ae-9b6c-9ae799ba1ede.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"09347936-3a4d-4ad6-a28e-a1632df9a906.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3d3a8d55-96ed-4866-bcf6-0e9ef0b5ed09.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6905313f-cc19-4aa4-875b-5971793fe580.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"afc3392f-ba57-4c73-b4ec-3e7be7f36e76.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36d246b2-0e6c-484d-a67a-9a8fbbb643c3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d0f49688-66d7-4efc-9424-844c082929c3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0109f952-0568-4fcd-8381-fa46e95c4755.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed426b1c-3b23-45e8-8ce9-34f7bf3082f2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"53e18b86-aae0-488b-b1d5-a766030a20f9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f7a58da8-9a08-4e74-873f-4eae45e908a1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"affec5c0-0125-4939-9c09-eeb2a2a14e5b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1d68ce32-b3e1-410d-b961-2042299db5d9.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"3aa1136a-9e1d-4ba9-8199-19e20c559b87.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aa0f6bb9-abc3-4a20-9a16-6519febe6632.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"52957456-92b5-4986-ac47-f68f899b1c4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c5734333-edce-4f1e-9ff6-63083220fb38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"83e00a23-6cc8-4c69-a664-6e0d975ce9ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"886c13a0-f237-4344-b449-facfe6bb2cd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Side Pocket","Overview":"Chalk up your cue stick and rack up those balls.

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\n\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called \"Easy Spin\" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-FAzHyXZPm0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetris"},"1425":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pack-In Video","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"140ec039-e4cd-4688-ac36-bfb27091a8e9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"14770022-3477-493c-b5f8-8ff874b13e61.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"68fdca6d-9bab-4337-88bf-c937b2483fe2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74462ecd-db85-4d17-8108-819d012be47a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a4cdefaf-0fce-427e-aff7-8a8e148e46f2.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8b359ec1-ab6a-4b7c-80cc-5e4a3c5d92bd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7f8d9b96-b0a8-49cf-801f-84751b310867.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Thunderbirds","Overview":"In the future, combat pilots do battle in the air, under water, deep within the earth and far into outer space!

After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails.\n\nBut to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet \"Stalking\" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages!

When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.\n\nSnow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fmt7wS9yQfo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snow_Bros"},"1450":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Virgin Mastertronic","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d5ab3bc9-16e2-4be2-ba04-292b26716539.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"c6180f48-bc6a-4d97-8376-f0dbb5f7924f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"70f4bcdd-d181-4c34-9587-a84e4cdccace.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0359d2ca-f0f7-42e1-a66e-2817dcfc20dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eaadde5c-0b78-46f1-9ef2-2d75de7d7f67.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3d2448bd-9b5a-46bb-9d29-5c5e6aafd91a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b0bcb73e-134e-4db6-8873-39e9f2c27d65.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e4b56146-29eb-4ca9-bb0a-c76a565aeca0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ed2e632d-33b7-4370-b843-d38e2f1886c1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7398d787-a388-468c-b2fa-3dc34c21c41c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Spot: The Video Game","Overview":"A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink.

One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.\n\nThis game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button.\n\nThe magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.\n\nTotally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E4zfEVP4zAc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Totally_Rad"},"1464":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Interplay","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f2b84602-a18b-49ae-8de2-94855c35b4a6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ebdc9ef1-92ca-4185-846d-26e650325cb4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d0f3c009-5b3f-4519-8ce0-37ea58e3ea0f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ccf5d55c-ef9d-4729-a9cc-7006fa19b94a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a606130-ed1c-48c7-a8b2-61011135ea33.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11ee72b3-2e80-4cc3-8a93-6c98b6d660bd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Total Recall","Overview":"Based on the 1990 Schwarzenegger film of the same name, Total Recall for the NES generally adheres to the movie's plot across its nine levels.

This Lost Treasure of Babylon is being guarded by the evil dragon Ryu. While the gameplay is basically the same as the other versions, the story for the Famicom version is different. It involves Karnov, who comes from a small town called Cleamina, being called by God to be his envoy. Karnov is tasked with getting rid of the evil troublemaker known as Alakatai.\n\nKarnov features nine stages of side-scrolling action. Karnov's main attack is to breathe fireballs at his enemies. Karnov can collect power-up orbs which can increase the amount of fire he can breathe out. Karnov is also able to jump, with the height being increased by collecting boots. Other items Karnov can carry and use include bombs, ladders, boomerangs, clappers (which destroy minor enemies that are currently on the screen instantaneously), and shields. Occasionally, Karnov will be able to make use of certain items such as wings which let him fly in the air and a scuba gear helmet which lets him swim underwater. Also, scattered throughout the stages are K icons. Collecting 50 of these will reward Karnov an extra life.","Publisher":"Namco Limited","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=G9oqgXOTOgU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karnov"},"1473":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"踢王","Region":"China"},{"AlternateName":"KickMaster"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KID Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"5be1677a-d32a-4668-b103-0edb879b79e5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c7507577-2e5f-4519-be25-3e5aa91ec41e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a0931791-dc14-41fd-acf0-c621b103888e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a89942ac-99eb-4cf6-9649-cd897a12ccf9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7b9ea8b4-e62d-4e01-a3d0-0e06636b081c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1240be0b-4928-4290-a16c-765c31fcccc3.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b737161a-4fa5-43bb-b880-f14af1f9c00d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kick Master","Overview":"The evil wizard Belzed and his forces have attacked the kingdom of Lowrel, killed its king and queen and kidnapped princess Silphee.

During a training session he is mysteriously transported to XXth-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities.\n\nLast Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance (Last Ninja on the NES) is an action\/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump.\n\nEnemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him.\n\nThere are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"1478":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer 4: Drasle Family","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer 4: Drasle Family"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"bc4a4387-35f0-4f82-8f0d-37bd64ccee33.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"50c82988-637e-4243-92d1-a225a3d635e1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ec8d6176-1a88-425b-a965-1dd4aa68791c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"615bc321-3328-4fbc-a1cb-1ef800fa4689.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e118cffa-eef3-461b-92e5-4e030e285bac.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d40747b5-a69f-4851-9d69-116041d8902e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cba159e8-1a60-4b03-bfc7-49a03a2bd820.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cd1259d7-69df-4123-905d-6603763dff7b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f190c08c-7673-4ea4-97c3-c882fce80a48.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"16dda2ec-7a4b-45ba-b931-a4deea44f8ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e89c2192-8d83-4cb7-9b2d-2764c02303fb.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"54f89545-17c1-49a1-87a0-573f0267d28b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6695bad8-3c6f-4833-a310-5a8f0ddd207c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Legacy of the Wizard","Overview":"Long, long ago, an evil dragon terrorized the forest until it was imprisoned by a powerful wizard.

The object of the game is to be the first to collect a card for each of the four colors on the game board. During each turn the computer will display seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn.\n\nEach game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely.\n\nThe game supports one to four players, however the NES satellite is not supported. If three or four players are competing, then two players will need to share a single controller. The control pad or A\/B buttons would ring in a player who knew the answer for the picture being drawn, then the controller would have to be handed to that player in order to enter in the answer.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1988-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yxbhxes6k7g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anticipation_%28video_game%29"},"1619":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rare","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c5a1853d-e46d-40d3-b444-d8d752582cfc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4d4617ec-b7ab-4255-8417-538c84165962.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c44bf508-c86e-4ab6-85eb-5827eb60fbf3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"df2eaddb-1177-4d3c-b954-4cb4e8874828.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"78b74829-e421-4616-903f-8850429ab653.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5afaa901-7242-4f0b-bb6b-dc05bb1d40dc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"64d310e6-a696-467f-ae6f-78431f5288f6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Arch Rivals: A Basketbrawl!","Overview":"The full-court action between the Arch Rivals is really hot tonight.

Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day\/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\nArchon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q9Cxg7MONvs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Archon:_The_Light_and_the_Dark"},"1621":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micronics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"8e789fcf-2186-4407-aa2a-658ac406e18e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c94e6bc7-eacb-41ee-9e50-c86f4b1c06e9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"83d4616c-b08c-45a3-a51b-777adc930a18.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36a540d2-7574-4210-865d-005f74e29b5f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"8515c8f5-0ef7-41b6-a28f-f2c0b5f79606.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"311a4f7b-9c02-49cb-b4c1-a379b8b65554.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"81027df4-1215-4676-804e-08a08eb5e920.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f8a0e8a6-5612-4b63-83cf-4ea01fbc3a18.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"898438af-71ef-45ab-83aa-b86c37c1ed84.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c303255-e918-4ff7-897c-449ce6a83264.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3d259024-e893-4173-888a-70915e37a45b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Athena","Overview":"I am ATHENA.

The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a \"cross country\" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"1648":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rocket Science Games, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c6c75cb0-57fc-445a-b065-682f8a253e10.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"71a82394-6561-40d4-9fb9-3e19646a0cf4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4314f56d-a212-425a-acbe-7e0ad48feda9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6c0d293b-c108-4ecd-b36a-50e7359e2578.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2d9c25d4-b2e9-4b20-bc28-3218c0ac04f6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6b676ca5-2442-4603-ae8b-2f3ab6409951.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a9cb4b61-677d-46ba-9b69-3c78201e3ea6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"381059a4-cfdf-4829-ab2c-bf760aae2222.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure","Overview":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure is an action-adventure video game that is part of the Bill & Ted franchise and is based on the film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure that was released in North America by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.

They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.

The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.  Players could chose to run single races at each track or run for the season championship.  The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races.  In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.  However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"1650":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Black Bass USA"},{"AlternateName":"The Black Bass II","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Another","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0b9f3547-70bb-43bd-900b-7d54f377571f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"66a4a73f-42b4-478f-8be4-ec33927cdeab.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6cd93d4b-858c-4ca4-9ea6-bcdb99c67b58.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3025d2d7-f121-4140-ad7a-4b1e94857c8e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"80ca22c8-68ad-4d29-8b06-7a889f5d5752.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4f61e9d0-9b7a-4ad2-af9c-e4e062855c0f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9a032ad5-67df-48f2-90ce-970b9dfeac28.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"12aeb91f-2a17-49f6-b00a-bb4b7a62053f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b27e474e-2353-47ee-9fcc-119bcf3228f0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4930ccf3-71fd-48aa-b101-14d8085fd47c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"41e5a36b-e34d-4830-91fd-951b898929ed.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"83622fb5-3f09-4bfe-9336-66eb5ac05bab.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"80c15ad5-a105-4592-a742-6ac6f3a08c74.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0e56f1f9-a796-4255-8e8e-26ab681dda11.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Black Bass","Overview":"The rumor is true that they will open the International Anglers Fishing Tournament with a selected 200 professional anglers at your NES.

After being accused of robbing a bank, White Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman's mission is to escape his prison cell and bring Black Bomberman to justice.\n\nThe game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.\nPasswords are given after game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts allowing the player to continue where he left off.\nNew to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the 3-player mode.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1_1r8G15thU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bomberman_II"},"1654":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"FC Genjin: Freakthoropus Computerus","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"FC Genjin: Freakthoropus Computerus"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A.I","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"0fced980-3512-4083-b036-c0f8465f0d57.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"99d4ae1b-e47e-4220-a6ee-7785dffc8208.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0e0ca57c-021e-4da0-97e2-0990e86f19e5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8bfe76e5-8160-47cb-905a-6b20d5be79d9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4927f4fa-4144-44c5-aabc-c6b194f61baf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59258b06-2d40-482a-ac9f-be244caa0fe4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc51d325-9d69-4769-a09f-ec0795765e44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"57468b37-3095-4075-8135-ecf28f64928b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0942fd83-9b60-414d-9aa8-9dc5009ae85c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3c42a67d-9274-45a3-8f4c-ddd521081ff5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"841fadd4-377e-4f31-9905-e649835e2c6a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5e4f2717-f7ff-4721-8dea-f3173308945e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a7e8150e-d46b-480c-9267-3081079f0fcb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bonk's Adventure","Overview":"Just say BOOGALOOGA!

The setting for Burai Fighter, according to the manual, is to fend off seven bases of Burai, super-intelligent cyborgs.  The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser and missile weapons, which are much more powerful.  The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross and Ace, but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked.  One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.","Publisher":"Taxan","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burai_Fighter"},"1660":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zippo Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a90d6275-0382-46e3-9cf9-2a6064d8ca9a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"708a5fa7-7515-4729-b6f0-077f4706a13d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5a2d44af-d262-4925-bf8b-51b9c70cc037.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f0a0749a-7f91-4a6c-8132-2ee6a680bfeb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fca4663b-8c83-4eee-afef-b11f1f565a7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2c6c8e50-80cc-4316-ad05-00366fbc0798.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1f00e323-6d25-450b-a0b8-64641a0faed0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"41be7f6c-acd1-4524-ac9d-eb000ed1eefd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Cabal","Overview":"The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.\nTwo players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.\nThe arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.","Publisher":"Milton Bradley Company","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3UxE4QSzbxg"},"1661":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Realtime Associates","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"42e7fa77-aa52-4af9-9be7-478be373724b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9205d14-2d74-49f2-92ae-bb6b222bf3f6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b2e66e09-23fd-4863-b1ca-c4c989903ad8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"20985730-27b8-45ad-8521-a9e9d6e004a1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3a9058ac-1aae-48f0-af42-b17991c55dce.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"22ff9492-4371-4cd1-9092-8de5b967c636.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Caesars Palace","Overview":"This game allows you to play in the Caesars Palace casino.

The game was often considered frustrating for its length and lack of a save or password system.  Phfax, a mystic being and wielder of the Emerald Magic, consented to offer his life to protect the stones of Rune.  For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden.  Until at last it drove him insane.

The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are \"Turbo\" (increase the speed of the boat), \"Fire\" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), \"Speed\" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), \"Missile\" (improves missiles) and \"Force\" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.","Publisher":"Atari Games","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"1685":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b30cff65-9490-4159-b993-375a44be4f88.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d598d817-0984-42d2-a112-a184969f0b3f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1cad4f78-ae02-4d57-b94c-05b26b2cd280.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a1387a27-506f-4f53-b6c9-6d623c4bc83e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b4048d37-313e-4d66-9a92-f411098c3976.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"db23fcd9-ee01-4d95-b50a-c7da4c871548.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine","Overview":"In Cybernoid, pirates have raided the storage depots of the Federation and stolen minerals, jewels, ammunition and the latest battle weaponry.

But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb!\n\nGameplay is from an overhead point of view; you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.","Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"1989-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"1693":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Imagineering","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"83759cfc-65cb-43a4-ada9-8149d2cc8774.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c80d954f-83fa-4048-b8c6-ee4e864bec3a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0bd97076-d2e3-4cb7-b35e-d45fe608f2eb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"32d980ed-4821-41ab-b6d7-f661e395ae3e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c9fe3b5e-e0f6-4a18-a94d-aac5273d41e5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Destination Earthstar","Overview":"The view of the game is from the cockpit of a spacecraft. The goal of the game is to explore a grid which is displayed on screen in search of opponents to destroy and to land on planets some of which refuel the energy and refill ammo to the player's arsenal of weapons which consist of his photon laser. This is his primary weapon while the torpedoes become his second weapon. After the player has destroyed every enemy that is on the grid, a number will be indicated. This number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid. After blasting numerous enemies, the player will finally be able to go to the planet labeled \"B\" on the grid. These planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill the player's vehicles energy or ammo. Rather, they are an enemy base that proceeds with the player entering a 8-bit cutscene of his space craft entering the base's gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami's Gradius or R-Type. Using this perspective, the player can fire projectiles from the front or back of his ship.","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"1694":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Realtime Associates, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"5b03b59a-95eb-4781-8f50-58cdb859e1f1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"519decb0-1212-402a-b2b2-4eef4b733cd7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b5810475-f965-456f-b07d-d5de569f06a8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa44986e-5e2d-4f39-b17c-3547930c2c13.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6379a8bb-e175-4d8f-97e8-92420a1806f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4941b343-c6ec-402d-9616-bb143a859e9f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1dd46d96-6147-4b25-9b66-5135ab25b87e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c2e78353-b4ad-4742-9dd9-3b0dee217d50.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b2174fdd-45a1-489b-abdf-eae3e112b2a1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c8012cf9-baab-407a-9ed4-806e1221fb73.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"da90df33-a043-4557-bcbf-0a857449bb7c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5deb32ad-2c0f-43c1-975e-6afcc5bfead5.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d7319e76-58e4-47ce-b39a-2f5dd6ba3b40.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dick Tracy","Overview":"Bandai released their version of Dick Tracy in August 1990.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day\/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Quest_III"},"1741":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Spidersoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"285b8a47-d4a1-4550-8b89-6e65f1354607.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"5fd61351-d109-48ec-af97-82001c391ef8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9862cdf6-5e49-4d19-9654-135024e75d85.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1ac057c5-7daf-40b3-9ea9-74668559803e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"df3bf995-7fec-424d-a1f7-bfd163413228.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7cdd2e02-2304-476b-9fd2-14c22f8a03e3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8dc7817e-6747-40ff-8006-b83e8e8e1685.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7851fbb8-5cdf-4a3f-a62a-a5f6288c2a0c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cliffhanger","Overview":"Based on the white-knuckle action-adventure movie starring Sylvester Stallone, Cliffhanger challenges you to brave thundering avalanches, icy cliffs and the head-spinning heights of the Rocky Mountains while you combat a vicious group of well-armed, extremely dangerous fugitives.

A great hero, the warrior \"Magi\", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, \"Tores\", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land.

To finish each level, Moses must acquire five question marks as well as a certain amount of manna while avoiding enemies such as magicians and soldiers. After a level is completed, the player must answer five multiple choice bible-related questions before advancing to the next level. After answering enough questions correctly, the player is rewarded with an extra life. Exodus, like many Wisdom Tree games, is a modified version of a Color Dreams game, in this case Crystal Mines. It was later ported to the Game Boy.

Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid.

The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest.

Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.","Publisher":"Culture Brain USA","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"1830":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"F-1 Sensation","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"F-1 Sensation"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"be0f9dd0-3fc4-45c4-a4be-5035c56c5420.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"04f4e978-df8f-4e60-ad42-72af01e34742.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"26386465-5724-4a0b-93bb-9e7ae5a8c6b7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"618e36a3-20da-4cc7-8c8a-5dd14d8b5596.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5df718ff-4463-49e2-9046-6ae36a7e9eaa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4f766280-4a38-479c-be00-9c16682612a9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"19b427dc-983a-49c5-8f27-5af02ace7369.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f30543b7-4643-45ff-8c6a-65196275655b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Formula 1 Sensation","Overview":"Formula 1 Sensation is an arcade-style racing game for the NES.

Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).\nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s\/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.","Publisher":"Hi-Tech","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3RDg6NC60YU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fun_House_%28video_game%29"},"1832":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kid","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"444f4aa2-4bbd-44ac-8ce7-0ac0e3b085df.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d6088072-268e-410d-b825-1e0d19ee440b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"866eab18-9e2b-4fc6-82b1-84ca2e7987a7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce542fe1-cf87-4f72-b55e-a91b2f5a5c50.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"19c23202-eebb-4277-bc65-ea127129aad3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6130cbe7-6795-462b-897c-452b909fbb55.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fd8a0a8b-3f5b-40b7-9f41-daedd9841388.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"02cc4b61-0d69-4275-b89e-be181eed45ec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"ed5204ad-defc-4ebc-8a7a-ea416d1b4a27.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1e6722d5-2216-4403-a6e3-355d33a1960f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"acaab548-b676-481f-bc63-dd09bf8b9271.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0934d2b7-b69d-4b3a-9eee-cd296248f407.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2ed4e790-b21a-4a39-82b0-7dd26607a94e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"84429625-fb7a-4023-ae43-d9a5f8a9c6e2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"53dffef9-688f-41db-ac6c-ded2d9f757d9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"G.I.

The game follows directly from the same plot, with Elvin Atombender seeking revenge, and the player having to stop him. The overall game structure and basic gameplay is mostly similar, but there are a few differences and new features.\n\nThe game takes place in Elvin's fortress, which consists of nine towers. Each of the eight outer towers has a specific theme, such as computers, automobiles, furniture and so on. Each tower consists of several rooms connected by two vertical corridors with elevators and two horizontal corridors leading to other towers. This time, the corridors leading between different towers are locked, and can only be unlocked by figuring out a numerical puzzle.\n\nEach tower contains the numbers zero through nine in three different colors. The computer interface will allow you to try various number combinations to see if they are correct.","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"1858":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"be355bef-a5ab-440b-93a0-03468cfd734c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"c2e6a76e-5730-4a75-af94-59b1e991dff3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"13b8ee29-d72e-43ea-a1d8-7d1c66148ad5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ee7116aa-08e5-42de-99ab-e9296445679d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fbbb7068-11d1-4ba2-ad6c-b833549b4eb7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb0c6041-264e-42eb-b652-ac3999ffe6b5.PNG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed79e497-8ad0-4f16-b36e-0f39df032c7a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"824066e7-a58f-4b06-97f9-95e9a34cba40.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Incredible Crash Dummies","Overview":"Have fun with some real headbangers...

The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.\n\nThe player advances through 12 levels (called \"waves\"), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies.","Publisher":"Mindscape","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_(1988_video_game)"},"1861":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chris Gray Enterprises","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"f97df22c-79f8-4cd8-8c6a-bd81a577521a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"441acb7d-3dfe-428a-aaab-536698f49f5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"16e95139-9280-4b95-8a8d-49a58b1ee550.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6dcc1551-1d23-4b3c-8e84-4243c366c8d1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Infiltrator","Overview":"You're Captain Johnny \"Jimbo-Baby\" McGibbits - The Infiltrator: Ace helicopter pilot, ballistics expert, rock star, motorcycle racer, and all-around good guy.

Players control a racing car through a maze, running from other cars and collecting flags scattered around. The aim is to collect all flags in a particular maze to proceed to the next one of the 75 available.\n\nThere is a radar in the lower portion of the screen where players can see where the enemy cars and the flags are. The enemy cars are faster than the player, so it is necessary to try to lose them. If that doesn't work, players can leave smoke trails behind that will stop the enemy cars. These trails take fuel away; the car can be refueled by taking the flag with a L beside it.\n\nPlayers can also collect food items which will earn them money. Running over animals make the players lose money. This money can be used to buy upgrades in a shop, accessible by pressing Start. The upgrades available are Turbo (speed boost), Gun (shoots enemy cars and stuns them), Saver (slows fuel consumption), Wheel (makes the car turn faster), Bumper (allows running over some obstacles), Secret (turns the car into a ghost, allowing for running through enemies), Rocket (shoots enemies and destroys them) and 1-Ups.","Publisher":"Thin Chen Enterprise","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1991},"1871":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Enigma Variations","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a409fa38-0fe7-4204-a623-ce5f2457421e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"334dbd03-84bf-495a-a50e-7634865aec04.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"99629045-682e-452f-a91f-4f2f05d2a9a1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c5c9b5d-1c4c-41ad-895f-bfcf08f68562.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kick Off","Overview":"Blistering pace - pixel perfect passing - superb tactical game play!

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six \"G\" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines.

In Count up, the players compete to see who can achieve the highest score. In Round the Clock, players must try to hit the numbers one through twelve in sequential order. In Half It, players begin with 40 points. Players have three chances to hit the assigned numbers to add to their own score. If the player is unable to hit all assigned numbers, their point total will be cut in half. The player with the highest score wins.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.","Publisher":"Electro Brain","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-jMsLpFDg7o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eliminator_Boat_Duel"},"1933":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"31980568-68fa-45a8-9708-b4dc4118794e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"998fd6b3-8da4-4fd6-84bd-76f9635d0eff.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0783d037-9261-4d3c-bba8-3243b5f2a8a5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8f061da0-94c4-4730-b170-1675109f2310.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bf138633-0611-4e29-9e91-13e2630c9f15.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Frankenstein: The Monster Returns","Overview":"For years the monster lay in the grave, and the villagers went peacefully about their business trying to forget the horrible nightmare days when HE had spread terror throughout the countryside.

Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. \n\nThe basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. \n\nIn addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include \"Attack of the Paint Zombies\" (similar to Space Invaders), \"The Warehouse Shuffle\" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), \"Four Alarm Rescue\" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and \"Leapin' Energy Casules!\" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). \n\nThere are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.","Publisher":"LJN","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"2007":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rare","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8f299da9-dc18-4ad9-b420-8dfb7f171248.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c5d39b15-65cf-4190-9957-4f131a313536.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f6e47b67-d547-4ae3-8b06-8750ce7b9530.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18749967-5b8e-4535-b8b3-5640c9041163.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4bf9aac9-61dd-426c-8eb5-6d5cf8b671f1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Pin Bot","Overview":"Pin Bot is a conversion of the arcade pinball game by Williams Electronics.

Either 2 players can compete on the same screen, or the computer can control the second player. The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Race_America"},"2030":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Moero!!

This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.","Publisher":"Hi-Tech Expressions","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uxRGPxgUKPs"},"2064":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Sesame Street: 1 2 3"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zippo Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"896c6470-dad5-417d-9c23-19413efd4bdb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"55122b66-5b19-461c-a44c-a7aa98af1280.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5a5b5844-fe04-432f-8e3e-e612eb2307c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"82e4f5ef-cd39-40ce-a6f4-08e90bfdad00.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"541ac73f-afef-4fd2-9aee-749b63d686c9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"006a33a2-d12b-4229-9add-1909db57f8b7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"00fe21d8-5739-4024-8753-8967c4489557.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f81cf63a-c86d-43a6-9af9-69f56648bd33.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0d5aa1dc-6dce-4f86-83b2-01ea1dee60bd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sesame Street 123","Overview":"Based on Sesame Street, the long-running PBS children's television show, Sesame Street 123 for the NES stars Bert's best friend and roommate Ernie and the lovable blue muppet Grover. \"Ernie's Magic Shapes\" consists of six different magic show-themed games that help teach children colors, shapes and pattern recognition.

You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1989-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"2073":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Short Order + Egg-Splode!","Region":"North America"},{"AlternateName":"Short Order + Eggsplode!"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d70c074c-7ede-40d6-9a3f-c782e1bcd27d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8157b502-ad22-44cf-a3ab-a808fed442ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9cd0b0ef-8fbf-41ad-9203-58c13c3bf664.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e158764c-38cd-42e8-8cf7-168d2c4679e0.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"012c945d-6a63-40c8-9b1b-79237e715662.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b2f1b133-8233-4e65-bb70-acceeba71095.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c02541ea-84e1-4b54-9834-741757763209.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Short Order \/ Eggsplode!","Overview":"TWO GAMES FOR FAMILY FUN\n\nEGGSPLODE!\nEggsplode! is Eggciting!\nThis hen-house will keep you hopping!\nIt's your job to protect the chickens.\nThe sly fox and his giggling friends are planting bombs in the hen house.\nQuick!

On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"1986-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r9JVHVr4hZU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solomon's_Key"},"2102":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"7bc83f5b-f158-46fc-844b-6773a7770f06.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"43b1a95e-dd91-4f2a-ac87-62c5afaeaca9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d91a2fdd-57b9-4549-b36e-dfec5b98d853.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e5439c9-7027-4a62-82ce-3b8eb5e8b38f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed8d6acd-c9a6-4e55-bf40-03bcf3cb64c2.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"80d521a9-cd41-460d-97a0-99511440b098.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3eb2ad73-69a4-423f-bfe5-f503b6c41e86.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dae02cdd-a478-4025-b2f3-c6ef950487cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Solstice: The Quest for the Staff of Demnos","Overview":"\"From Out of the Darkness...

This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.\n\nThe game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.\n\nBy the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CS5y9CEUl2g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arkanoid"},"2154":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visual Concepts","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"88dd0766-95d0-4a7f-a138-c05abf25d8f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9c5cf9f1-1d25-49bf-8d7d-7f786a0e313a.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3631f772-c27c-4cbd-a9a0-4700eda1eba6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a97b62e3-f414-4fa9-bf97-a516fef67aec.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bc033197-ab28-46a8-9003-8724fb7ae869.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc353f14-7e19-41ea-a798-1f4ba24cfb17.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d834b50d-661c-4dad-ab40-98a7b803e9d6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f518b7f8-dd05-42b5-9bbe-871f550b70a6.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b5677cc0-6e70-425d-aef8-23405f24060e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a8b86a3-9ee6-49ee-a24e-e13a7c30a826.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Trog!","Overview":"It's survival of the fastest in the prehistoric land of Og.

The player can sail around and discover ports belonging to either of the game's three nations - Portugal, Spain and the Ottoman Empire - as well as politically neutral ports. These neutral ports can be invested in to increase the player's wealth and reputation. The end goal of the game is to build the player character's fame through discoveries and by winning ship battles with pirates and rival merchants, which eventually allows the player to take on tasks for the King of Portugal who will restore the player's nobility in gratitude.\n\nUncharted Waters was released on the NES and MSX originally, though versions for SNES, Genesis and PC followed soon after. The series received a few sequels, though only the first sequel - Uncharted Waters 2: New Horizons - was localized and released in the West.","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZZRqsR5yAS4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncharted_Waters#Uncharted_Waters"},"2162":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Akuma no Shoutaijou","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Akuma no Shoutaijou"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ICOM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5fc068c2-2fc9-40d4-a7a6-7af778c2b160.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a50cbb0d-faa7-4744-9045-bdbac3200ee3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4b4bc4b7-8619-4249-b514-aea7d2f441a3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"550b5e96-f782-4ed4-9a2e-4f25c5d7751b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5a0a46b3-70c2-4274-9cee-0660c8a846f7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7427d8c7-ef76-49cd-9713-b4cf5cdc63a2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"734a9fe1-3a90-43f8-8af7-a6a58d6e6e5c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"afde9a30-2a20-4f76-80d8-d4a9720b1726.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"83cf80ac-16bc-4695-80df-e01dfac58ba5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Uninvited","Overview":"What a pity about your automobile.

His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. \n\nMuttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"2170":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Money Game II: Kabutochou no Kiseki","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sofel","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"3e838197-0cc2-4a9d-9c29-8064b634c7fe.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a1aacda4-a5e2-46f6-a264-142db6c57f61.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3ff1784c-9d12-484a-8e78-e84313050cc2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"274d2113-e7a5-46f1-8f93-99de973bcbc6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"75caa8b0-e789-4811-9a06-4161ef4a1d39.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"34e7db6b-08fc-4c0f-ae33-e9b5ac4ce940.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9be81bef-ad97-41f0-b8be-b54a18d10b40.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e01ae3cd-05f3-4504-8eed-f8e321ff79d6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a41f81ef-0c02-48f8-bd75-33fe8bbea1fe.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"28d59851-f661-492c-bb35-5b2b53f92831.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d5fb8bbf-de45-4b07-8422-a52a34a57a99.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"741b83a4-1156-42c1-a016-108a61869017.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2c8766d6-db15-4a06-af00-25f9f85af1d8.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wall Street Kid","Overview":"Where life, love and money all depend on how well you play the game.

As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"2785":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"A la poursuite de l'Octobre Rouge","Region":"France"},{"AlternateName":"Hunting in Red October"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beam Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"4704dcff-b683-4aaa-bbc4-40ae3cd67f95.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0b72a18e-52f8-47ee-b405-c3c55d5d454e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"585b9ddc-7b76-4417-b93f-2ae237dd9df1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d331767b-3e60-4370-b1b9-c045cb7d738c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cd8e27db-01df-42f3-bc4a-86185b5d90fc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"40ca6723-bf18-4ec2-b47d-ffeb85a90762.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ff7e5c61-3fa5-417a-a3c6-304ecae61dc9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e6599cea-6a12-45d2-b9b0-84ed54f0b774.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d97ee05c-971a-4dc3-89d8-751802e8bd29.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b2dc1d5d-a8de-46d8-ba93-fdd1010b9711.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"028dc066-03ef-48f5-b523-0bf45d7b74cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Hunt for Red October","Overview":"Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class submarine with nuclear strike capabilities.

A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition.

To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.","Publisher":"CSG Imagesoft","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"2906":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beam Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"7705fb57-2988-47e6-b8c4-77d08e0c5872.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7499abf5-6680-458e-8fb7-c35c0a4d3834.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0820a74d-6960-4c3c-807f-7deee6aac0b3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8d5094a3-48f4-40b7-a6f1-2e33bdbed081.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"db6b937c-f44c-4a0d-a222-a67ff7175015.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Family Feud","Overview":"In the NES version of Family Feud, the game tried to recreate the look and feel from the original Richard Dawson-hosted series, even going as far as to include a Dawson-like host who kissed the female characters in the game. (This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.\nJust like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.\nA player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.\nOnce a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.\nIf a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of \"Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today\". Excuses used include \"tax considerations\" and \"a birth in the family\".","Publisher":"GameTek","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"2920":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Motivetime Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"85b3ed3f-5044-4bb1-8d22-efef7986f76d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"739565e3-2144-4c2c-b3cb-0e2714b7e763.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"696ca61b-fe6e-44c1-af5a-484ff60b1f84.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"34ba5001-3339-459f-bd20-1b169bcad4f8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0093e6b3-1654-4624-b199-89b54983f95c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"440b0686-749d-4646-9752-4e4ab9154983.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45d28fd7-3f11-48da-8b41-5cf4a65f9c29.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"368c0b13-4ef2-4ccc-b246-81b31eba7b2e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"759384e3-6f35-46fe-ade7-896ce2d552b5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Prince of Persia","Overview":"The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour.

An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's \"Kenrip\" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.","Publisher":"Data East","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"7824":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"paopaolong","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Taito","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"f19d9a23-a80e-442c-b1d0-3edf01ea752c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"cda8b1e6-2d0c-4b7b-a705-ebbba33375d6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0ecb13d1-2b5f-4c28-8083-abb6f6639692.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c7d1afca-1012-445f-9b96-e5f70ad795e7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0c9fc06a-c3da-4327-9f48-c994dc4819fe.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eb7b8aac-4974-45aa-b6d3-21c0bad5ff02.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fb2f54a7-5210-4b39-be83-ad3240613295.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7cf66cba-de89-48b6-9ec6-04a4b0dc7317.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a34b70d3-d174-443c-9373-4481becf6cac.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1a98f9f0-b405-44de-b2cd-e070fa3ae619.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bubble Bobble","Overview":"THESE ARE TWO HUNGRY DINO-MIGHTS AND THEY'VE GOT BUBBLE FIGHT'N FUN DOWN TIGHT.

It is based upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.\nThere are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.","Publisher":"Konami Industry Co.

After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.","Publisher":"American Technos","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crash_%27n%27_the_Boys:_Street_Challenge"},"7829":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Painting by Numbers","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"60fb834f-8e8a-4881-972d-73d193233928.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5eeea642-580b-4796-98bd-3ac6cb9a4982.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7a86f887-5c6e-4738-941a-969f5ff893d3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"87340e0a-18df-4805-9ad1-39cb699f36e6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1bd06c58-3ac7-456f-9648-a5b4fe6cffe3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4c497d13-1e02-4efe-978f-6da97ea33639.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Darkman","Overview":"Once, he had a normal life, a beautiful girlfriend and a brilliant medical career - creating synthetic skin for accident victims.

It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary.

The goal is to solve a word puzzle by guessing letters. The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player if the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed -- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings.\n\nThis NES edition of the game allows 1, 2, or 3 human players to play against each other. Human players can also elect to play against computer players and at 3 difficulty levels. \n\nThe Vanna White Edition differs from previous Wheel of Fortune games on the NES in that it actually bears the likeness of Vanna White.

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. \n\nThe gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.\n\nA player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.","Publisher":"LJN","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9100":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Black Dragon","Region":"Korea"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Color Dreams","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"cf56c54c-83d8-406d-aba4-7762c88c3942.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8a5b36ff-b63c-4a9e-a29c-ae11c76e758b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"64652ea6-7cd1-4a15-a46e-6188d195fcd8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8d1c4408-d791-4ef8-bcbd-3569ddd258c3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a7127911-aeb2-4d55-ba73-076fa69d3758.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8a5a1027-6241-4b32-8a09-f76061d01083.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9d5f2b5e-fda3-4234-a548-331e2190f7da.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Challenge of the Dragon","Overview":"Are you the savior spoken of in the ancient legend?

It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1986-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14659":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Natsume","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"9f273e1e-031e-451a-96db-3d1138947b40.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2b916130-9e31-43c0-a9b6-789d02fca9da.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"49649436-5fb5-4abd-bf8a-9b51732aaf6c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac88fbb4-e42f-4a95-b5d3-bf1825c9dc24.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"896d04be-286f-4ef7-8a58-f0c2a35dd002.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3299e9a1-6982-41f8-b8e4-18775c2e277e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e775fd7b-812d-4ff5-90b6-3d3606e005d9.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9c88dcd9-eb8c-4065-b1a8-bdd684b70973.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f8864cc6-c2f3-4a1a-b5c2-493dfb512358.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Don Doko Don 2","Overview":"Similar to the original Don Doko Don, the player controls a bearded dwarf wielding a hammer to flatten enemies and throw them.

The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\n\nSweet Home is a Japan-only Famicom release that was produced by Capcom and developed as a tie-in for a Japanese horror film of the same name. It is one of the earliest entries in the survival horror genre, if not the very first. The game is also one of the sources of inspiration that would influence the design of the original Resident Evil. Many elements seen in Sweet Home are also present in the latter horror title, including the isolated mansion setting, use of puzzles, and the door animations that Resident Evil used for its loading screens.\n\nAlong with being an early survival horror, Sweet Home can also be considered an early immersive sim, as it had a number of core elements of the genre.\n\nUnlike Resident Evil and other modern survivial horror titles, Sweet Home was structured as a horror-themed RPG. The characters in the player's party earn experience from winning turn-based battles and can level up. However, if a character runs out of hit points, they are killed permanently. The game features multiple endings that are dependent on how many party members survive through to the end.\n\nEach of the party members also has a unique skill that they are able to perform. The effects of all of these character-specific skills are required to progress through the game, but in the event that any character is killed, there are items that will allow other characters to use the skill of the fallen party member.\n\nSome of the immersive sim elements of Sweet Home include an open-ended environment, choices and consequences, non-linear game design, open-ended narrative told through notes and diaries, interactive environments, allowed multiple ways to achieve objectives, and no fail states unless all player characters die.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/-IAmphK8UPA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sweet_Home_(video_game)"},"19041":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ganbare Goemon!

The goal of each stage is to put out all the fires. The fires are extinguished by either kicking an ice block into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb on top of a solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push blocks of ice, which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy blocks of ice. As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the ice block is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another ice block, it will freeze to the adjacent surface.\n\nThere are also other elements that are introduced as the player progresses, including pipes (which Dana can travel through) and jars. Dana can walk across normal jars, but once a jar comes in contact with a flame, it begins to burn. Dana cannot walk across the top of burning jars, and any ice that is created in, or enters the square above a burning jar is destroyed. As players progress, the puzzles get more complicated and difficult.

At first Nakajima intended to use the software to gain revenge on a classmate who bullied him. However, things went out of control, and the malicious demon Loki was unleashed into the world. Soon, a demonic invasion of the Earth began. Aided by the lovely Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student who seems to be interested in him, Nakajima decides to undo his wrongs and defeat the demons. In order to do that, the young couple will need to learn how to use the program for good purposes, and uncover the truth about their own previous incarnations. \n\nBased on a series of horror novels by the Japanese author Aya Nishitani (the first of which is named Digital Devil Story), Megami Tensei (translated as \"Goddess Reincarnation\") marks the birth of the eponymous role-playing franchise. The game is a first-person RPG with turn-based combat, set entirely in large, maze-like dungeon areas. Unlike in most Japanese-style RPGs, the player can manually increase combat parameters of Nakajima and Yumiko when they gain a level. \n\nThe game introduces the demon summoning feature that has since become the distinguishing gameplay element of the series. The player is able to communicate with randomly encountered demons through Nakajima's computer software, summon them, and make them fight as members of the controlled party. Communications with randomly encountered demons usually involve offering them money or magnetite (energy they consume); the outcome of the communication depends on the demon's race, alignment, and the phase of the moon. Demons can also be \"fused\" with each other in special facilities, creating more powerful species.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1987-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_Devil_Story:_Megami_Tensei"},"21493":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atlus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"14552742-e158-459c-8902-79a1f9b6119e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"25d9029b-daf3-4e09-8e18-52d4c50a143b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"08d2bf49-29f1-4fe6-90de-e92efcdfccfa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4dd7986c-5cf1-4247-8440-e5595dc077fd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a53261ac-06ac-47e9-a2ba-4f099b0f154f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dcd017b8-70d7-41c4-8ef1-406a440e7ba8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b2fd22e3-235f-4b7a-9d28-c71090fb3d7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II","Overview":"Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is the sequel to Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei.

The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game's sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.\n\nThe gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received.

It is the sequel to the first Famicom Saint Seiya game, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu.\n\nAs with the original game, the story draws heavily from the first story arc of the series. This version picks up where the original left off, with the Bronze Saints about to take on all twelve of the Gold Saints in order to save Saori before time runs out. The game remains faithful to the original story, to the extent that your options are limited if you try to choose match ups that didn't occur in the show.\n\nThe gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes where a saint must survive long enough to reach a particular Gold Saint's temple, with a turn based combat system against the Gold Saints. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute a pool of Seven Senses to a Saints Life and Cosmos. When Life is lost, certain Saints can be revived under certain conditions, but many are taken out of play. Other Saints and characters become available at particular points along the story.","Publisher":"Shinsei Kōgyō","ReleaseDate":"1988-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"21564":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a8ccceee-307e-4e21-8f55-7a3732a407ae.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5cb9f27c-cb7f-4ef3-9eaa-f82da840176a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d94ce693-f0e4-4b1b-9279-bd6d9c0d7201.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"35b1352a-758e-4792-92df-90dc9dafb81f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":6,"Name":"World Class Track Meet","Overview":"Re-release of Stadium Events, which turns your home into an exciting stadium, dares you to increase your physical ability and better your athletic record.

It bears the distinction of being the final official Family Computer game in Japan and was never officially released for the international market. Unlike previous entries in the Adventure Island series, Boken Jima IV plays less like a linear platformer and more of an action\/adventure platformer, similar to the later Wonder Boy games. Adventure Island IV also has a unique password system that the earlier games in the series didn't have. It also features an egg item that allows the player character to teleport to the special spot where the player puts it. There is a large variety of weapons to choose from which are unlocked by the player throughout the game. Many special items can be won in races and challenges, such as an angel\/fairy item that allows the player character to re-spawn once, at the spot where they lost all hearts and even an compass that acts like a map showing the player with an arrow where to go. Whereas in the earlier Adventure Island games the player character had a food meter and when it runs out, the player lost a life, in Adventure Island IV, the player simply collects 8 food items to regain 1 heart as health.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Master_Takahashi%27s_Adventure_Island_IV"},"22442":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Splatter House: Super Deformed"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Now Production","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Horror; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f35d32f8-82d1-4efb-8f8d-a32871407300.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"be230ff0-85f1-457e-bf64-e2b2ac8100c7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef9aa4c5-233c-4992-b004-352ae6f2352f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7e479b0d-2a27-4c6b-9467-46917debc4df.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7f4cdb6d-c859-48dc-92ff-18a6fc646c9a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c6499015-8faa-4757-a95e-9271bd96f7f2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti","Overview":"Revived by his girlfriend's grief and a flash of lightning, Rick must chase down the Pumpkin king and save his beloved Jennifer once and for all!

During an archaeological trip on a deserted island 17 years ago, the couple discovered an Aurawing, an aircraft built by the ancient Mu civilization. Inside the aircraft there was a life-support system containing a pair of infants.

Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. Also, unlike most video games of this time, it was never even announced. Most cancelled games saw months' worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft's Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser\/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.\n\nThe game features a superhero, named Sunman. He is very reminiscent of Superman with his cape, and flying abilities, as well as the games title screen seems to match that of the Superman logo. Sunsoft's involvement with other DC Comics character licenses lead some to speculate that Sunman was intended to be a Superman game, but DC for whatever reason decided not to go along and the game had some changes made to lose the likeness. In an interview with planner\/director Kenji Eno, it was confirmed that this was originally intended to be a Superman game.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sunman_(video_game)"},"22493":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Legend of Getsu Fūma"},{"AlternateName":"The Legend of Fuma"},{"AlternateName":"The Legend of Getsu Fuma"},{"AlternateName":"Getsu Fūma Den","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c55af465-abbd-4408-99b3-a502d34860e5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ee64843b-5672-4b46-b440-1df2ff35f3ca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e6f6e70-373a-4b1f-83ab-a50af5d4e5cd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a83cbdb8-d855-47ef-9786-89267a219fa0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c931e753-6b16-4070-bce3-aa1eef64071e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7803ab5d-c03e-494d-974b-5d507c23a86c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a4c54f24-eebe-455e-857d-4fd6b954ea74.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2395252f-c681-4927-b266-bc26364f9412.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3f7928df-ff62-4fc3-9a1a-2272a77e4c4d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f22db467-aa39-40a5-83da-ab76e7295f87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d78f3f11-7e29-4b36-a359-7f16432b95d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Getsu Fuuma Den","Overview":"In the first years of the Demon Age, a horrible demon named \"Dragon Master\" was revived by his minions in hell.

Another interesting twist to the game is the Uoru armor; a shadow sometimes appear on the ground and if the player aligns his own shadow with it, then the ship transforms into a powerful robot for a short amount of time. Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed. After the boss is taken care of, the player must successfully land on a runway and be cautious not to crash the ship.

The player must play through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami games. Subsequently the player uses a key to save that game's star character, who then becomes playable. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in a sort of non-linear fashion with gameplay very similar to the original Castlevania games. After these stages are completed, the player plays through a scrolling space shooter stage and then a linear final stage.\n\nThe player will also regularly visit the lab of Dr. Cinnamon (from the TwinBee series), who will give the player the game's character profiles and refill energy when needed. Through his lab, the player can also talk to Saimon, Dr. Cinnamon's brother, who can resurrect any defeated characters at the cost of 100 bullets per character during the game.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nxhwIPPCQeY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Konami_Wai_Wai_World"},"24747":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Winkysoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"9f423dda-84fc-4e35-8b13-7ba1ae85b1ef.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"27930098-653a-47fb-a705-0f51477f030f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6ddbcde-c346-4c64-9cee-9e6834b07ac7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium: Heisei Gannen Ban","Overview":"Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium Heisei Gannen Han is a Baseball game developed by Winky Soft and published by Taito for the Famicom platform.

The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise.\n\nRoads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.\n\nThe player starts out in the poorest district of Brooklyn and must work through the boroughs of New York City outside Manhattan, including Queens or The Bronx, in order to amass wealth. With luck and finesse, the player can ultimately break the bank in New Jersey. To enter a casino, the player must find a permit (which serves as photo identification for the casinos) somewhere in Brooklyn. Slot machines come in denominations from $1–$100000 depending on the neighborhood and the presence of a VIP card. Three types of slot machines can be played at each level and the player is photographed when winning the jackpot.\n\nPlayers must be wary of dice games that have dangerous risks in addition to card games - they randomly appear like monster battles in traditional role-playing games. Many buildings including airports, police stations, and casinos either help or hinder the player's attempts to earn enough money on the slot machines for passage to the wealthier district. Guns (in the form of a pistol) can be found that can protect the player against muggers. However, the police will confiscate the weapon from this player once he arrives at a certain area in Manhattan. Pachiko-kun (the player) will also be arrested and will be held unless a $100,000 ($190,899.33 in today's money) bail can be paid in full.","Publisher":"Coconuts","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PCHAW0eAHEU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Dream_(video_game)"},"24828":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ankoku Shinwa: The Dark Myth"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Another","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6e99160f-8cae-4fb6-9ec1-f4cceed0d85c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e37d1c08-2070-4c5d-a45c-34d0e00c33e8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"591de204-de45-4d02-9196-69ec21a0acae.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae66cc58-a40e-4ba2-abbf-fe3d4f79d666.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b23f37d0-17b4-417b-b592-710932e4362b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0101ff5a-370d-4b5d-b2cb-bfebe22e34c9.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4a740035-3922-4be8-a808-ab7c0813bac2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0411a07c-af78-4008-9c4c-991718b3b582.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2d2dd744-ff6d-4ac9-8649-dea2885e75fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ankoku Shinwa: Yamato Takeru Densetsu","Overview":"Ankoku Shinwa: Yamato Takeru Densetsu (\"Dark Myth: The Legend of Takeru Yamato\") is an adventure game based on a manga of the same name by Daijiro Morohoshi, who wrote a lot of sci-fi and historical mangas with dark Lovecraftian themes.

One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.\n\nHello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.\n\nThroughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airborne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.","Publisher":"Character Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Balloon_Kid#Ports_and_related_releases"},"25403":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Fist of the North Star: Hokuto no Ken"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Shouei System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"2b3112b2-33ff-484c-b87c-8e09915a88d8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a902a75b-70d4-4435-956c-e4ad846f8518.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7684d461-3b9b-4ca1-b4d3-a83790b5aa64.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5539b5d7-69e0-4129-b573-11cf177810a1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b26f277d-53c1-4a9c-90f3-f2d67dfbe05e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c4ced0b3-1d1e-4f5d-b2b7-e4a029f0ed75.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e56b9ddc-4512-4d68-aed0-9e1c23c67f76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Hokuto no Ken","Overview":"Hokuto no Ken is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the anime series of the same name.

Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen\/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.","Publisher":"Tengen","ReleaseDate":"1989-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetris_(Atari)"},"25758":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Star Wars","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Star Wars (Namco)"},{"AlternateName":"Star Wars (Japan) (Namco)","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Piccari Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"0d360e1a-8b7f-43d9-9885-2fe23c2ec4af.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"514e20a3-d403-4fc6-bef9-d057cecbc868.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ad099e22-e467-4c0f-922c-b5d0aa9fedbc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5c0093de-6fe5-410d-adcd-1e02d82dca23.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"68dc0b86-0cc5-40d2-ba29-1918677bbe5c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"af79df63-314a-44d4-a053-8270f132f0bf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"65df3dde-395f-46af-a147-45fd1f861871.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"085ca09a-74b4-40c8-aaff-9041f3277cc6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8ef6f6f7-a85d-42fa-8d1b-1b5ede498ff2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Wars (Namco)","Overview":"This game is a side-scrolling platformer that has Luke begin his travels on Tatooine.

Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j_N_M6CL1NQ"},"26248":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"AIM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"180d2a14-c90d-4f5b-8c2b-70b01aa6a83d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"29b042c1-0325-4138-bed0-e8cee7b3977e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a2dc412c-05d1-400f-8ce2-a09997be8e84.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5716290b-fe0f-4b12-8920-8343a10199aa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"4fc20684-d891-4847-b13a-bb1bd8e578d7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"184774f8-705f-4938-af48-74e8794bda17.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"326251a9-67a5-49f3-bca4-f62b3e188365.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a7489471-eadc-4181-b6ef-699e2e359ce1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Armadillo","Overview":"Armadillo is the name of an NES\/Family Computer platform video game, published by IGS in 1991.\n\nThe player controls a yellow armadillo with a red hat named Billy the Shell.

Hundreds of years later, a descendant of the king, named Darutos, stumbled upon the location of the wing and decided to use it for his own ends.

The circle\/rune feelie system was clearly inspired by Western RPGs like Bard's Tale (which would also later influence The Secret of Monkey Island's slightly more tongue-in-cheek \"Dial-a-Pirate\" anti-piracy protection device).\n\nAlso of note was the game's use of the day\/night cycle which, similar to Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, would clear civilized areas of wandering NPCs at night and replace them with monsters. The player can also hack apart said innocent NPCs as readily as monsters, though doing so will usually carry grave consequences.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1987-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26349":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atelier Double","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f33e9bda-3bcb-402c-beea-ed843b97d5d3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3fd21d09-b476-4c21-9441-a3e66f091af4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7fa0fef7-a520-4fec-bedc-83cf70ec06d5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"065511e6-a9c3-451c-b9e5-76a9eb5e7760.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b5fe4135-ba2b-4344-84d5-c7c9e161fde8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c5b4141-4273-4e9c-9deb-3c7423cc8e7f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight","Overview":"The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight is a Role-Playing game, developed by Atelier Double and published by Pony Canyon, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-25T00:00:00-08:00"},"26350":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Batsu and Terii - Makyou no Tetsujin Race"},{"AlternateName":"Batsu & Terry - Makyou no Tetsujin Race"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Use Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"e6ee3e5c-73c9-4f18-a560-4ee891165ae5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5da189eb-12cd-4ed1-accd-7f92a2399c7f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"13e16194-e91a-44e9-b97d-9af3a477666b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a50239f-073c-4b9c-b906-b916c9fd610a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6652b574-b38d-4fbb-bf91-37ed6fcbc4f3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"311decee-db9e-4f62-92ec-313d5d56ca71.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dc82cd23-ec89-4519-915f-a5d13c55708a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2e41dec6-a1fd-4b4f-b58d-e3546e40a3c9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bats & Terry","Overview":"Bats & Terry is a side-scrolling platformer based on the manga of the same name.

Destroying certain blocks can reveal heart icons (collect 100 to gain a 1UP) or POW which increases weapon power. The goal is to simply reach the end of the stage before the timer runs out. The game consists of six worlds, with four stages per world.","Publisher":"Use Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NE3VuJV83Os","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bats_%26_Terry"},"26351":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Bussan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f7ccd5b8-ee0e-4016-928b-26f1887cb60f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b23a4f45-5196-415b-b539-4d7b7ef873f8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"76b8b2bd-5508-45b5-99fb-71965f39e180.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b16a4a81-5920-4e6c-a345-0bdd9fea67d5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"689a4e4c-ecc9-43ff-8e10-cf36f6b0d80e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Booby Kids","Overview":"The game is set in a pre-historic environment, complete with cavemen and dinosaurs.

You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a Monopoly-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering \"yes\" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.","Publisher":"Coconuts Japan Entertainment Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z8T45GZV9fw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1999:_Hore,_Mita_koto_ka!_Seikimatsu"},"26386":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Shen Tan Ke Nan","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mighty Craft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1d362d08-64a2-4945-8eb9-2f291734800d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc5fc9f6-f27e-4d1a-bab0-a3575c8f4aab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"145b3e7f-daf3-44d0-a070-e632533a623f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f79f58dc-7da3-4bb7-80b1-298b4294f89e.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"740d303f-e123-4305-9529-77b1399bf70f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7acf9f28-b2b5-43c4-8873-7d459fa77399.png","Region":"China","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"958da750-78d0-416c-a3ed-492ed4152f8b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"67f2c4af-d480-4182-9781-e826e5918c49.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Akagawa Jirou no Yuurei Ressha","Overview":"The game is based on the detective story Ghost Train, the first one written by the popular Japanese author Jiro Akagawa.

The player can choose from historically accurate 1988 presidential election candidates George HW Bush (for Republicans) and Michael Dukakis (for Democrats) as well as real-life political figures involved in the 1988 election - Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson. They can also select between a fictional representation of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called \"Sasha\", and \"Suzuki\", a Japanese-American senator from California with a pro-Japan platform presumably intended to appeal to the game's entirely Japanese audience.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player has four different issues to take either a liberal, conservative, or centrist position on. The player must make wise use of his funds as he is trying to become the President of the United States of America. Being liberal offends the religious folks, being conservative offends the university students and working class voters, and being centrist (as in pleasing everybody) actually pleases nobody. The player starts in February 1988 at a convention for his political party somewhere in the Midwestern United States. and must work his way up to the final election results on November 1988 without becoming bankrupt.\n\nIn the presently unknown primary election, candidates in five states (including players) make the final selection along with the decision-making. Opinion polls and election campaigns (speeches) do benefit the player in his presidential campaign. However, the primary elections in are not implemented in all states in the same way. Some states may be processed automatically by computer (a fixed number of delegate count) while others in a more manual way. The Super Tuesday primaries are to be held on the same day in many states, ballot counting is done after the player has made simultaneous attempts in each campaign state into three regions. After that, the primary election is made (not counting district units held, subject to the provisions of the delegate count.)\n\nThe priorities of the policies that the player can make were introduced to the game as the situation was in 1988 because of the Soviet Union and the CoCom. In 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union would eventually lead to CoCom being disbanded in 1994. South Africa had an apartheid at the time and abolished in it 1991. The Panama Canal Zone was returned in 1999 to the people of Panama. However, it differs from the political situation encountered in the game. The \"AIDS patient isolation\" issue was showing an event of discriminatory policy of an era that had not shown wide public awareness about how the AIDS virus manages to spread from person to person.\n\nIf the player manages to win the game and become President of the United States, the official Presidential Oath is displayed in English.","Publisher":"Hect","ReleaseDate":"1988-10-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GHMU3qcGooE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/America_Dait%C5%8Dry%C5%8D_Senkyo"},"26389":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pixel","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8e1adfb6-02d7-488a-8a35-188fefb6ff3e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"37e7c56a-2ec9-4fb2-8b1c-38f34fccff6b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"64c055b5-a52a-48c2-af26-9c19393c5bd6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fd583778-7711-468d-884a-1c4f6fa281c2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"ff27cf75-0b28-4974-978e-b41dea6141bf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"36d031b2-29df-4f7e-a10c-8c6c29445a19.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"061f313a-2b20-455c-ab5b-05718997e364.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"88e48c76-09e6-430c-b487-49c62ea7a818.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d6503e00-f12f-4ff5-be3b-915dfc45b1fc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz: Shijou Saidai no Tatakai","Overview":"This game has two modes: story and tournament.

You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. \n\nThe twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0FblDT544bQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sasa_(video_game)"},"26391":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Super Pitfall II","Region":"North America"},{"AlternateName":"The Mystery of Atlantis"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sunsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"e9165d67-e53a-432a-b64c-12fb9aab14bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6691ee65-5991-4aac-8749-d8ee07bb3922.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a2530f32-49aa-4108-b926-3e4a96335b04.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"42bfc16e-eb8a-4ed2-b108-16a8f7a29e17.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"75f1ffa7-1627-448c-bc1c-d333d475051f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"36845921-9de3-487f-8acb-8c1fc77c9a8b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"358a254d-f6f6-401e-86c3-2e71c3bbf18f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"91308a13-840f-46ef-af74-0b1f48eae503.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bcd6c6b1-ec86-4af4-b37a-348f655a23df.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b328459-8214-4286-bc47-409899ecb35e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ac26c3ba-a21c-4f1a-9009-9f698a51e49c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"0a93496c-e7c2-4026-816d-1468ce00b9a1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ce4ba463-b1d9-4f1c-9fad-5623b646b1e8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Atlantis no Nazo","Overview":"Several years ago, a gigantic island arose from the southern Atlantic Ocean due to sudden shifts on the Earth's surface.

Each side is represented by a craft called a \"rotofoil\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \"droid\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\n\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\n\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \"sudden death\", where the first player to score wins.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-04T00:00:00-08:00"},"26456":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Shouei System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"68f57a80-9595-4b7d-adfb-36ce4990b2f3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5e7e3dfd-0d02-4883-bae9-e65b1074ff86.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"93afcb02-b146-4a6f-9a01-16a608709515.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5376cda-fa52-4ad9-a845-07699969fe5f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"0cdcbf27-3578-49b9-b55c-0360113e3e5f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"41a91ded-ff9e-4e43-9198-0852c271755c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2ddc109c-e410-40ed-9855-1860d624f46d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"207f24c2-91f6-4ef6-a12e-2cd2482f0de5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dc129d58-9136-49b6-a13e-8cd736d5911f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Baltron","Overview":"In the space year of 2999, the powerful Bismark Empire has decided to launch an attack on the planet Earth.

(Which is not displayed anywhere on the HUD.) A jumps and the B button lets the character perform their attack (unlike the original, doing it while standing doesn't cause you to move), run, and pick up and throw barrels. The game is notorious for its controls: the jumping is considered to be awkward because jumping causes the Kong to move at a running pace and the player can only turn around when at the peak of the jump while jumping forwards, which makes it difficult to do precision jumps. Another issue is holding B doesn't automatically make you run; you need to complete your attack before you begin running.

To find it out, Ultra Magnus must travel through a set of platform-style worlds and fight a range of bosses, ranging from the Megatron, through the combiner series to a flying Decepticon emblem(!).\n\nUltra Magnus starts out in robot mode, where he can jump far but his shots travel only halfway across the screen. Press down, and Magnus transforms into a trailer. In trailer mode, he can pass below the planes as well as shoot upwards. When a plane is shot down, it transforms into a robot, which must be killed with the forward-pointing shot.

He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!\n\nThe game plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early \"interactive fiction\" adventures.","Publisher":"Yutaka","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/iPPXXEpuJ6o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ushio_to_Tora:_Shin%27en_no_Daiy%C5%8D"},"26562":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Takara","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"8c01a39a-b0c8-414e-995e-a95943c0ade3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"85be5ba6-5c77-4f05-9a75-31330b960b5e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4b9e073d-2340-4e91-a419-0ac8622729e8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bd4c2b67-9196-4a5b-9e12-28158e0abe35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"32445d0b-891b-4097-953a-acbe37fca9fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Utsurun Desu.: Kawauso Hawaii e Iku!!!","Overview":"While ostensibly a traditional platform game in which the player controls Kawauso-kun, the game has gained renown for being one of the earliest titles to attempt to break away from the video game conventions of the time.

Based on The Venus Wars manga series written and illustrated by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, the game takes place during the year 2089, long after humans have taken settlement on neighboring planet Venus and focuses on a war between three factions for control of the planet.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the Hound biker gang, who have taken it upon themselves to defend the nearby Io City from encroaching forces from the Ishtar Empire. With eight attack vehicles that resemble futuristic hoverbikes and two transport vehicles which repair the bikes and replenish their ammo, the squad moves from destination to destination repelling the Ishtar forces.\n\nGameplay varies between turn-based strategy on the overworld map to a vehicular combat mode when engaging in close combat. The goal of these sequences is to eliminate all the enemy's craft as they fly or drive towards the player, using a finite supply of missiles and an endless supply of bullets. A certain number of special enemy types, usually purple in color, need to be destroyed for the unit to disappear from the strategic map.\n\nRole-playing elements also take precedence with the player's ability to level-up and gain experience from fights.

In its time, the game was considered a major success in Japan.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26580":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hect","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"90cc731e-a3dc-40d1-b085-85181404e371.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b15666c7-eaaa-4be7-9726-4f55fecaaa0e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"65cab796-4347-45d2-9797-830c5bf915d1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1d51211f-9b39-4e79-8abc-b4ecc23a28ba.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c6f75e6d-4620-4d86-952b-f774bc2e704f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d5f28e85-3b64-4d1e-a88e-92adf60865c8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cadillac","Overview":"Cadillac is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1990.","Publisher":"Hect","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-02T00:00:00-08:00"},"26581":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Graphic Research","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8af8d41b-e239-427b-8c37-2d21b292be22.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"632e3ff8-8558-4ade-bd32-79446a38a4d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa819819-65b4-431e-8802-8513d4041cf9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Captain Ed","Overview":"Captain Ed is an Action game, developed by Graphic Research and published by CBS Sony Group, which was released in Japan in 1989.","Publisher":"CBS Sony Group","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-25T00:00:00-07:00"},"26582":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"8c7f7c48-cfc9-4667-8bc8-4487eb64ca4a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7808be41-7132-4662-bb6d-3c9af6180f0a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"37b14610-959b-445f-b35e-669376ad06d4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a5a61453-9cc0-4ab1-b4a8-1a4da884768c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1db5de84-95bd-4777-b3e4-ed4dc5d04188.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9e6b042c-778d-443b-a5b8-720e24cfad9d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ea187d2d-05a7-4dd1-a823-2e76c3867ab7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Castle Quest","Overview":"Castle Quest is a Strategy game, Do not confuse with Castlequest from ASCII Corp, a platform game.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-18T00:00:00-07:00"},"26584":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"96fb602d-c9ad-4e20-aa70-0b5cf2dcd740.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c1d75167-4af5-4d4c-ae9c-18de0abe1cac.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4b2e7d19-8897-4310-8c7d-0b6d34083629.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cb3a65ef-f8a4-47be-a462-7ce251127e2a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"178fa628-c569-47cd-9a8c-0078e281364d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0a836573-0268-4bf1-a1a1-cabb613bf6c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"25ff598b-7032-4d60-a469-147e717fe33e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3b430d3a-1536-4ab4-8364-110d76ebf09e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Chack'n Pop","Overview":"Chack'n Pop is considered a predecessor of Bubble Bobble.

The Monsta eggs have three phases: if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.\n\nChack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages.

The game consists of two parts.\n\nThe first level (or \"scene\") has you racing the clock to get to the front of a train, where a purple-faced villain is holding your significant other (or, perhaps just some anonymous princess). You have at your disposal a trusty throwing knife to take care of enemies. You will also have to dodge obstacles and jump gaps in the train. This section is taken from the earlier Hudson game, Stop the Express.\n\nScene 2 places you in an overhead, maze-like environment, where you once again have to fight the clock. This time though, you have to navigate your way through the area, in search of all the different \"keywords\", which are placed in different caves. Once you have cleared all the caves, the path will be open to the boss' final lair.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1985-10-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ilnNShog3Ok","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Challenger_(video_game)"},"26586":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"83df1355-0dc3-4de5-b38e-c4d527b9ffcd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a9121854-af25-489a-98cc-b4cb1287612d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8ef0bd7-9b14-4333-8c54-215ea0e827b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c8273355-b874-4c2c-982a-f1ce3a9060cd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d381fb97-bcd9-4b15-8538-efedf0950bc9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d1d9207e-28c3-4f59-9995-7c1de6281105.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"eb02a1fa-4606-4f9d-94fe-8e9c55bd1f27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3dbfca95-20a2-4995-9e59-cf67099ac817.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Championship Lode Runner","Overview":"The object of the game is to pick up all the gold pieces (which appear as piles of gold) and get them to the top.

Mad Doctors), who throw objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building (with larger objects appearing by more aggressive Mad Doctors in later levels).\n    A giant condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber (two at a time in the early stages, four in later levels).\n    A giant ape (styled like King Kong), whose punch can prove deadly (he becomes more aggressive in later levels).\n    Falling steel girders and iron dumbbells (more numerous in the later levels).\n    Live wires, which protrude off electric signs.\n    Falling 'Crazy Climber' signs.\n\nSome of these dangers appear at every level of the game; others make appearances only in later stages. Should the climber succumb to any one of these dangers, a new climber takes his place at the exact point where he fell; the last major danger is eliminated.\n\nOne ally the climber has is a pink \"Lucky Balloon\"; if he is able to grab it, the climber is transported up 8 stories to a window. The window onto which it drops the climber may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.\n\nIf the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter would only wait about 30 seconds, then fly off.\n\nIf the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score.","Publisher":"Nichibutsu","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26596":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"eaf7d6c1-5783-436d-b0e8-3afc4f2d3d63.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bbf42d12-e223-4b86-83f5-112f1d7bddb4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"81bc999a-f237-4991-a092-434dd6f36b76.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7c3e7f1-2d5d-4a16-b809-edeb0aab1fcf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7678041d-87a6-4171-9b36-5ba73ff565b2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cycle Race: Road Man","Overview":"It is the player's ultimate objective to make it all the way around Japan.

Mahtari's task is to take resources from 15 different hostile planets and also defeat the enemies who inhabit them.\n\nThe game starts out on the map screen which shows where the homebase is and also where the other planets are located. It also shows how much resources are currently at the homebase. These resources are used to add more spaceships to the players fleet.\n\nWhile flying around sometimes enemy spaceships will be spotted. The player can ignore them or choose to enter a turn based battle with them. During the battle, players choose where to place their fleet on a square grid map. The player's fleet and the enemy fleet take turns volleying shots at each other. The victor of the battle is whoever still has remaining spaceships in their fleet.\n\nPlayers have to be wary of enemy spaceships as they will attack the planets the player currently has possession of and must be defeated in order for the player to still claim ownership of the planet.\n\nBefore taking control of a planet, the player lands on the planets surface and enters into a side-scrolling action game in a mobile attack suit. Before this section begins the player is shown the enemy and gravity bars. The higher the enemy bar is, the tougher and more plentiful the enemies will be, and the higher the gravity bar is, the more it will affect on how high the mobile attack suit will be able to jump. Also, the player is shown a silhouette of the planets surface and can choose where in that stage they want special items to be deployed. These special items include multiple missile strikes,a bomb that will destroy all the enemies currently on the screen, and an item that will refill the player's depleted shield back to a full shield. Players then have to shoot or avoid getting killed by hostile enemies, then defeat a boss enemy to fully take control of a planet.\n\nThe game offers four different difficulty modes.","Publisher":"Toshiba EMI","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26615":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Datach: Battle Rush - Build Up Robot Tournament","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Datach: Battle Rush: Build Up Robot Tournament"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4639fecd-ec4e-4d5f-9230-e23b2d7e0ca8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a7ec32a2-91b7-4ffc-9ca7-b9d1ec61761d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"850bb75b-51cf-418f-acf6-0a7eb1a30c63.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aab0598f-ac8b-4945-8f27-e5942f904ec5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Battle Rush: Build Up Robot Tournament","Overview":"The player has to build his own combat robot to use in a fighting tournament.

Kids, this game is simply a platformer without any puzzle elements to it. For example, players had to search outside Ronald's clubhouse for four of the puzzle cards to allow them access to the next level while the Donald Land video game simply consists of defeating enemies while avoiding damage.\n\nThe game stars Ronald McDonald (known in Japan as Donald McDonald), the mascot of the McDonald's fast food chain. The objective is to bring peace to his magical land by controlling the famous fast food clown. Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned feral. His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola.Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's \"Life\" meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game. This will result in gaining a bonus life along with the hamburger counter resetting itself to zero. It is also possible to play a mini-game challenge, to earn commodities that the player orders from McDonald's.\n\nRonald can replenish his life bar by finding heart icons that are scattered throughout the level; the maximum number of hits that he can withstand before dying is five. From the second stage onward, the levels become more demanding with emphasis on making jumps from platform to platform while avoid bottomless pits. Items also become more difficult to reach and falling into a pit results in instantly losing a life.

However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.\n\n\"Elysion\" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.","Publisher":"Tokyo Shoseki","ReleaseDate":"1988-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26786":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Atlus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2c2fd505-722b-4adf-ba8b-140de88dda6a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"beefaef6-0bc6-4ec8-b03f-f3dbbffba617.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c1bbfad2-ec88-47c7-b2bc-c2e6b4629902.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6c9ead9c-54d0-4167-928b-fa499178b802.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"91e2a8c8-4043-405e-abd5-6b4a6ad07d87.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"90dd6abf-626c-44f8-a462-a465735a8f68.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"987e9f79-8ab9-4770-b9b2-de40b88123f2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken","Overview":"Two children, the girl Erika and the boy Satoru, live together in a small house somewhere in modern Japan.

As in the arcade, some characters must be rescued in order to make them playable. This game boasts over 50 household items which serve as animated enemies throughout each level.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bf9UT17YJzY"},"26789":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"16f0740f-a7f5-4e40-be05-03d026d889f8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eb9f76e8-2835-4491-9213-b9329320a4e1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e68ca528-b410-4b3f-a236-83aa0b759888.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5b526777-2bac-46de-82ad-d5a6a3053235.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b57d5a4e-b701-4844-9d4a-0af512eaf0a5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"416cdc2e-2fc3-4de8-8598-f398526a2ff3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5ebc4e0c-f987-4a81-be6f-9f124675f0aa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59e4c995-1a43-4b37-8415-bbf58a8451f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"046e45cb-4534-40d1-b12b-e2f6ff739e73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bb29af5e-f203-483e-92d9-6ebd57c86bee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"65a04c5f-cc11-4375-930f-780363ff426f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5ccaff06-3e45-4a81-9c65-6ed52b91f8a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b1826a37-327c-4dc9-9cbc-9c5f048742c8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Esper Dream 2: Aratanaru Tatakai","Overview":"Far beyond our world, there's a world that resides in the books you read. But the five areas of the Book Worlds are in deep trouble! As Mamoru, a bookworm with ESP, you must go forth (with the help of a magical fairy and several other allies) to grab five special rings and save the Book Worlds from many perils.\n\nThis sequel to Esper Dream takes you as Mamoru on a mystical journey through 4 areas (one of them, the world of the original \"Esper Dream\", has already been done for you), each with their own problems that you need to fix. Like its predecessor, you begin battles (which now take place in different battlefields) by running into pairs of moving footprints - however this time Mamoru can simply run away from battles that are too much for him, or use a Teleport spell in enclosed fields. (Using this spell outside of battle will return you to the base town for that world.) In addition, Mamoru can bring along a friend (one per world and controlled by the CPU) who can assist him while battling and give him clues about where to go next. Mamoru can also carry healing items with him, for a quick boost of energy when he's running low.\n\nThe game ends when Mamoru's HP reaches 0 - or when you have saved the Book Worlds.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26790":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Human Entertainment","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0ac367f2-f051-41d4-b793-d22b7fa85497.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c2bf763d-7553-4aff-84c2-fb57945fedaa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"60482526-355a-4085-80e1-b53cff27b56a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3859222-66eb-4c4b-925b-0f513b2c523c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"45e4d0bf-fb6f-4596-8b00-8f335f3bb6fb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee487993-d6aa-49da-8826-31b875ff7acf.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ce0cef29-dc93-48a3-a94f-3f438e4534c8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a38ee8ba-271e-4086-9b94-ccd18b65b454.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Exciting Boxing","Overview":"Exciting Boxing is a Sports game, developed by Human Entertainment and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-16T00:00:00-08:00"},"26824":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Make Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"0c26b94b-f1b0-47ba-83c7-6b2605b8e528.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fbf073c8-b3dc-4327-beb0-770eae98afd2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0d76a70f-066b-4ca1-bb9e-0d7c1991066d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"90c8acff-de19-4f60-9747-ae116e25178a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4facd97a-482d-41bb-8625-f8233ea22010.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"0548ee60-f235-4589-b0fe-6043f5b859a0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f9e255a2-7718-41a7-9e49-acb6206bd1ff.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"F1 Circus","Overview":"The game was released on September 14, 1990, and the word \"circus\" was meant to be a mistranslation of the word \"circuit\" (or \"circuits\") because the pageantry of Formula One racing slightly resembles a circus.

Some of this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide.

While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.","Publisher":"Ascii Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26847":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Daiei Seisakusho","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"679f66f5-4847-4f85-b238-48d66a74526c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0a25990a-9178-4657-9110-afc4adce6c15.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61953949-6e29-435d-aa4b-2e18d0ed64b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8e2053e6-edc6-4079-b473-c8e5faefad31.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Flipull: An Exciting Cube Game","Overview":"Flipull: An Exciting Cube Game is a Puzzle game, developed by Daiei Seisakusho and published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1989.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-15T00:00:00-08:00"},"26851":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Aicom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"996d1df7-a52e-432a-a38f-930abca0d1e7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5d9c49d-22bd-46f1-9e7e-421526a3cb96.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9d838dd7-e3fa-4b6b-9a86-85686b93ffb7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Flying Hero","Overview":"Flying Hero is Arkanoid-like arcade game about firefighters.

Also, players have to be on a lookout for spots where they can pick up food and drink so they don't starve or die of thirst on their lengthy journey.\n\nSince the game lacks a proper save feature, the player will occasionally be given a code input to put in at the game's title screen, so the player can continue the game from where the code input was given.\n\nThis video game was featured in the Japanese TV show Game Center CX. It was declared to be one of the hardest (and least comprehensible) video games in the history of Japanese video games. Championship Lode Runner has a similar difficulty level to this game; even though it belonged to the puzzle video game genre.","Publisher":"Vap","ReleaseDate":"1986-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26886":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Garfield: A Week of Garfield","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Garfield no Isshukan: A Week of Garfield","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Garfield: A Week of Garfield"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mars Corp","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1423e6fb-302f-4173-9dbe-fb8aed8583d7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ab65e03d-c5ac-4428-8dec-86508d55dfb8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"92306af1-b0c7-4b46-b0c5-dd2025cbb98e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"07635b59-f441-4162-a76d-76bf1fe26f42.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"50c023eb-453a-42a9-9fb5-ea7ef42af07a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8864f492-4a05-4c73-bab6-bd5ca3f84a9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"A Week of Garfield","Overview":"A Week of Garfield (ガーフィールドの一週間 Gāfirudo no Isshukan?) is a 1989 Family Computer title based on the comic character Garfield.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.\n\nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\n\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-22T00:00:00-08:00"},"26889":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micronics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5656a4d1-7757-4c2c-b702-273e1fde6c43.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9aff59d0-80bb-4769-a398-64bfbbef71a3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07560c51-71c0-4161-a5f6-350952c75ec0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"872c19bf-6ad8-4b29-a5a1-4f04ec195325.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fe720e6d-dda9-4b76-857e-12a4dc5e2f49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"d217fdde-e9ea-4862-8789-71ff19d5bff3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"46255234-05ac-4c67-8133-73b980a0c952.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Geimos","Overview":"Geimos is an arcade style space shooter where players take control of a spaceship that flies over several different planets' surfaces destroying the incoming enemy units. \n\nThe game contains two different game modes. \"Mode A\" keeps the games camera perspective in the same position.

Upon reaching a castle, a battle will begin. Battles can also occur in the field. You have no control over these battles, as the stronger team usually prevails.

Here you play as the bandit Gaou, who lost an arm and eye as a baby and as such was scorned by his peers. Since then he has resorted to various tactics, not least murder, to survive. However, one day he fought a monk who encouraged him to change his ways and follow his unfound natural talent to sculpt, which is thus put to good use in a variety of sculptures unique in their raw emotion. And then, he meets a fellow sculptor, Akanemaru, who once was attacked by him, and the two engage in encounters with a phoenix, who, it is said, will grant to those who drink its blood eternal life - and the rest is history.\n\nGaou's goal is to grab the 16 pieces of the picture card which, when fully revealed, will uncover the picture of the Phoenix. The action takes place in 16 stages (one picture card per stage) spread out across three terrains inspired (for the most part) by other volumes in the \"Phoenix\" series. Half of the stages take place in Gaou's own backyard of Feudal Japan (c. 720-752), while five stages take place in a Future World (not unlike those shown in the \"Future\", \"Space\", and \"Resurrection\" volumes) and three stages occur in Prehistoric Times. Some stages, when completed, will lead you to the next, while others from other time periods can only be reached through secret warps. Gaou can use his chisel to attack enemies or the gargoyle head statues he used to chisel with it to make makeshift platforms. The game ends when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has successfully assembled the Phoenix picture card.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26965":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Higemaru: Makai-jima: Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken"},{"AlternateName":"Makai Island","Region":"North America"},{"AlternateName":"Higemaru: Seven Islands Adventure"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0797b9da-0a3a-43b1-a48b-f72120d675ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ac0f1925-c75b-46cf-9cb8-7a24c69e3e23.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6b552b0-a2fd-4a46-a2d5-b85169e4f293.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a8f4b28e-c9f8-4964-b924-9434af8e129e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"931e0b2c-d94c-4a20-80f4-92eaf68ebf8d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"674337f4-b215-446f-ae1a-f27968e9ce96.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"77973442-2d90-41d0-a2bd-ebf1f957ecf8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bee7fbaa-2a3f-4579-9cf4-7ac90886eae2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4021c90-7031-44bf-a58c-7812b0f06b41.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3400ed4f-7f89-492e-9142-99bbb5b04398.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"16979a57-e4fb-4d4c-98f6-eb00d19217b5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Higemaru Makaijima: Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken","Overview":"Higemaru Makaijima (魔界島 七つの島大冒険 Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibōken?, lit. Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\".\n\nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.\n\nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ljOeqD11zfw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pirate_Ship_Higemaru"},"26966":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Open!

To help him, broken bricks sometimes reveal items that Jajamaru can use to his advantage, possibly leading to him getting the ultimate power-upa ride on Gamapakun, the giant frog!","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1985-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ninja_JaJaMaru-kun"},"27153":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0eda93fe-be47-49cc-ab59-9181db917e4d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"afe7c896-d621-4907-8b40-6ffa356c2df8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"769c7c30-312c-454d-8692-101d0071dcba.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi","Overview":"Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi (じゃりン子チエ ばくだん娘の幸せさがし? lit.

It is a game based on the Jarinko Chie anime and manga about a dependable girl who struggles to help her troublesome father run a small tavern in Osaka. Unbeknownst to her dad, she occasionally visits her mother who left him not too long ago. She plans on trying to reunite them, but not until her father gets a job. The game follows the plotline of several episodes of the anime. Though it is largely text driven, there are moments where the player must play a mini-game in order to advance to the next chapter of the story. Much of the text in the game is presented in traditional Japanese orientation, written top to bottom, and right to left. The game was only released in Japan, and never translated from the original Japanese.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27154":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"JESUS: Kyōfu no Bio Monster"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chunsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"01cd0fbb-87f2-4137-b307-5e2e43411c95.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"07b6b5f3-a120-4947-a499-0f5daaf87266.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"36988c0b-50b4-49cf-92be-b98ac4c20806.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9be86c21-a6c4-4489-aa9b-6070b6a4c4ff.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"JESUS: Kyoufu no Bio Monster","Overview":"In the year 2061, a manned space mission was planned for Halley’s Comet, which would once again be nearing Earth.

The game was only released in Japan.\n\nThe sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets.\n\nJJ was the last game by Square to utilize the \"3D mode\" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.","Publisher":"Square","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_3-D_Battles_of_WorldRunner"},"27156":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Jumpin' Kid: Jack and the Beanstalk"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Now Production","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b169590d-b4cd-484e-84c0-c39fcafc90c1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7ea2498-7a0d-43c7-a11b-94f7474803d8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e2a4042b-2abc-4586-9c3b-f04274018e7d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jumpin' Kid: Jack to Mame no Ki Monogatari","Overview":"Jumpin' Kid: Jack to Mame no Ki Monogatari (ジャンピン・キッド ジャックと豆の木ものがたり?, \"Jumping Kid: The Tale of Jack and the Beanstalk\") was released on December 19, 1990 in Japan for the Family Computer.

There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27173":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"793ba684-02af-4ce5-9298-821520bb78d3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce4a86ab-d623-4587-9638-00e0b97cf7b8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"98766830-8c2a-4d67-bac6-07f0720792cc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Last Armageddon","Overview":"The humans who breathed the toxin-filled air on the Earth's surface became one with the Earth and kept dissolving. The history of humanity ended and dominion of the planet returned to the demons. These mutant creatures did not depend on oxygen to survive. Therefore, they were able to breathe the air and use the land.Meanwhile, an army of robots wage World War IV against the demons in order to conquer what is now known as Makai - the Demon World. These robots came to the planet on a wave of energy that created an explosion that turned the world into a wasteland. Much later in the game, concurrent themes including Adolf Hitler, war, creating a perfect race of people, and the destruction of humanity in the year 1999 are revealed to the player inside one of the robot's main bases.\n\nCan the demons gain dominion on the humans' old planet or will robots enforce impose a millennium of logic and dictatorial force throughout Makai? Playing as the robots is not an option that is open to the player. Therefore, the player must take advantage of his or her mutant army and crush the robot invaders. This game builds on the fear of robot domination of the world that has been featured greatly in movies from The Terminator to Terminator Salvation. The gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy as the turn-based fights are viewed from a third-person perspective.","Publisher":"Yutaka","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-10T00:00:00-08:00"},"27174":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e001279a-da4f-4f8a-9446-3c8d3e565d18.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a5343f3-2098-47af-afd3-f4a886410d6d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"640709d2-502e-4d9a-ae8a-a0c4a5325c3d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2148d6b1-fc17-404a-a0af-74bba923ba76.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c2756789-c486-4fc4-bc6f-33982e56c3bf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aa5cdcd0-a091-4400-998d-f13262fb14d2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a4bb3aa4-2cd8-4a5f-9001-000bc2e14680.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"be3e8084-dc18-4562-8d92-bf214ef8b3da.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Law of the West","Overview":"The entirety of the game happens in a small frontier town, and the player takes the role of the town's Sheriff. The scene is the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm and gun are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.\n\nThe actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response. Law of the West marks the first use of this now-common interaction style.\n\nAs well as the discussion, the Sheriff occasionally gets involved in gunfights. In this case, the gameplay becomes a pure test of shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters would react if the Sheriff drew his gun before they had a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun was put away.\n\nIf the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor's in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help, or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to make it alive to the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1987-03-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27175":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"dB-SOFT","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"556e8b1e-77cf-4038-a6bc-af3e605f34dc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8137c959-949a-48d9-a05e-a22a794a0adb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6892ca3e-c5ba-42fb-b679-225479d40dad.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4c7ebdea-00d3-4b67-93c0-94996689a97b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e29d010-f78a-4db9-acf6-56d1174e816e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"29fb0356-40fa-4f66-9c5e-3d89aa370a40.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4ca20f34-b430-49ad-aac1-74574283e3ec.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"be465d92-670e-4d50-acce-8ab7aaa61bfa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Layla","Overview":"Layla has to rescue her friend Iris from a genetically modified apparatus named Jill; who is apparently controlled by a Dr. Manitoka. As a member of the CAT Special Forces, Layla has all the skills needed to foil Dr. Manitoka's plans.\n\nEight different asteroids have to be explored before being able to rescue Layla's best friend. Each asteroid is divided into two sections; the first part involving the surface of the asteroid while the second part deals with the actual enemy base.\n\nThere is an equally large mechanical element to the level as there is a biological element. The screen always scrolls from left to right. No backtracking is permitted on any level. While navigating through the cavern-like interiors of the asteroids, enemies must be defeated and password disks must be retrieved. At the final room of each asteroid lies a boss that must be defeated before being able to move on. Several guns in addition to some hand grenades can be used to destroy the bad guys impeding Layla's progress. The handgun is the player's initial weapon; but more powerful weapons can be found just by exploring. Certain blocks can be broken by using the player's chosen weapon; the difference between destroyable blocks and non-destroyable blocks is sometimes indistinguishable.\n\nBonus levels distributed throughout the game allows players to destroy entire squadrons of enemy ships while being completely impervious to their attacks. Players must be wary that every weapon has a limited amount of bullets; players can possess more than one sub-weapon at a time. When Layla's life reaches zero, she dies and immediately loses a life. A password is shown after the player loses the game.","Publisher":"dB-Soft","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Layla_(video_game)"},"27176":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"魔道士的阴谋","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data East","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"0a66f08e-6d31-466c-b6b7-f7a04a774a3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"364bc983-ead1-4347-923a-87fe350d2827.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aba068b4-10ad-4d53-bb35-85b3a21a8be0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7138c44f-c9af-4b50-9966-65f26a8eabac.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d711ae69-b1ff-4e0c-90dc-8caae0e6a3a5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9acb7de3-b492-4640-9fb9-41f46dd3d7cc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fd71c090-46a4-40a6-95a3-5b83311d082b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Little Magic","Overview":"Little Magic is a Strategy game, published by Data East, which was released in Japan in 1990.","Publisher":"Data East","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3rOYlOSdQx8"},"27177":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CBS Sony Group","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6c08da64-6576-42d2-9341-875f31f3d604.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"95669126-87d4-48c5-b29f-6c789b41f1bb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a566721f-1bff-4691-8da4-7c03ee1094a7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c269be96-2383-4649-a701-7595d461b2ff.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"TM Network: Live in Power Bowl","Overview":"TM Network: Live in Power Bowl (TMネットワーク ライブ イン パワーボウル?)[2] is a Japanese-only Nintendo Family Computer game featuring the J-Pop group TM Network.

The actual running happens automatically: the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly.\n\nIf the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will immediately be over.\n\nObstacles along the way include Slip Zones which will slow the Runner down if he tries to cross over them, Pitfalls which will break under the Runner's weight and drop him into the holes beneath them, and Crackers which will launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.\n\nThe rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards, where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one. Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans; kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27203":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8ca6c9b9-cddf-4762-87f9-20316b763b5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94ad2319-4533-4122-bdf8-206e157dde75.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b1ff38d5-ddd3-4d96-a712-84467f828517.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mindseeker","Overview":"Mindseeker is an Adventure game, developed and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1989.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1989-04-18T00:00:00-07:00"},"27204":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Tabo's Tactics"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bits Laboratory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"95852c92-d550-4419-8fa2-2ae042e02c23.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e3267a49-5f0a-405a-ac82-ef7758138802.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c8610701-3c0a-427c-ac69-19db81f808da.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Minna no Taabou no Nakayoshi Daisakusen","Overview":"Minna no Tabou no Nakayoshi Daisakusen is a Puzzle game, developed by Bits Laboratory and published by Character Soft, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Publisher":"Character Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27205":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Future Wars: Lios","Region":"North America"},{"AlternateName":"Future Soldier: Lios"},{"AlternateName":"Future Wars: Mirai Senshi Lios","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"df5a8a15-0614-4e94-8558-5d595d7a262b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"24f488d9-68b0-403d-9d92-ab42e941eff5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"86ef96e1-75cc-4da5-bd62-17f7e0ed6ca6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2970edfc-7afa-4a79-ba31-dec4d4ce614f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fe65e454-e7d0-4d99-bcaa-01e1acd6a268.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bbb8a53f-3a02-47c1-b15e-f15828e6f99e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mirai Senshi: Raios","Overview":"Future Wars: Lios (未来戦史：ライオス Mirai Senshi: Raiosu = Future Soldier: Lios) is a turn-based strategy game developed and published by Pack-In-Video, the same developers who brought us Die Hard (NES).

How many times the Waverider's laser can be fired is limited by a recharging energy bar.

For the third phase the Gundam infiltrates a space station or battleship, and gameplay shifts to a side view similar to the previous Z Gundam game. Here the player can freely shift between Waverider and MS modes, both of which can fire its laser at enemy mobile suits, as they navigate a maze to locate and destroy the core.\n\nAside from the much later Famicom Mini release, there were two versions of the game: the original release; and a special release of the central location test version, sometimes dubbed Final Version.

Momotarō is a boy who was found in a huge peach (hence his name, \"peach guy\"). When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don't play directly the story of Momotarō, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbōgami, or \"poverty god\", who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do with each other or the story of Momotarō, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarō as a character in every one of them.\n\nDespite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged Japanese-style RPG with levels, party management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person perspective.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27215":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sofel","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e125c028-7a2c-42d8-bf6b-a574a7a8f943.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4ec1e2cd-0dfc-4e19-a123-750c09d4ad55.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8e2aed25-8a97-4e5d-b882-514c6407f9b0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Monster Maker: 7-tsu no Hihou","Overview":"The world was protected by seven gods, who protected the eight races.

It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1986-03-05T00:00:00-08:00"},"27235":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ninja Jajamaru in the Castle of Evil","Region":"World"},{"AlternateName":"Ninja Kid's Demon Castle Adventure"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"83fe3e9a-8e63-48ef-a0c3-8f6d51bb455a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e262c277-08b3-4366-a172-452f3573af01.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eaa24ec8-e404-461c-b95a-18988e0455be.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"20fe8cd6-48fb-4601-b225-65c0fbc8ca96.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2ee9b1cb-5f7c-44f5-9222-8d359229c36e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"72cdc4a6-0d72-4df4-bf00-39c80584fae3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"02343e97-80d7-4fea-a8b4-8214d93b4641.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"eb2065b6-1b61-419c-a642-59141b2081e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ninja-kun: Majou no Bouken","Overview":"Ninja-kun is on a mission.

However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.\n\nUnlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be \"average\" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of \"dog catches cat; cat catches fish\" - emulating the food chain.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1985-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27260":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer Jr.: Romancia"},{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer Jr."},{"AlternateName":"Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr."}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2f7ca1fb-3e7f-4fbe-946f-753914f9f8e2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b75cf7ea-7882-45ac-8181-7024ef53797d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"997da13b-47e7-46a2-ab9c-f84abf6c4ad4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a02f8a31-48c2-4df6-b1a2-87a833b6d391.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Romancia","Overview":"This game is also known as Dragon Slayer Jr., is an action-adventure game developed by Nihon Falcom in 1986 for the PC-8801, PC-9801, MSX, and Sharp X1 computers.

Sansara Naga is set in the fantasy-filled lands of India during the Vedic age and also mixes elements of Japanese folklore such as the legend of Brāhmaṇ Umibōzu (海坊主||\"sea bonze\"). Many of the NPCs in game will tell you that Cows are sacred animals and a few will mention the Tower of Ṛta Satya. There is a set of armor in the game called Dharma Armor, which will prevent the player from dealing or being dealt damage.\n\nThe story revolves around a Boy\/Girl that steals a treasured Ostrich egg from the village of Orissa and decides to reflect upon one's actions; aspiring to become a Dragoon to restore their lost honor. The protagonist will set out on an adventure saving lives, performing good deeds, and raising a newly hatched dragon. There are bosses and many NPC street vendors will attempt to scam you with defective items or attempt to mug you. While the main protagonist does not level and their base stats are fixed at 40 STR, 40 DEF—The dragon that you raise does level. More unique game mechanics to this game include the ability to feed dead bodies to your dragon to raise his level, enchanted armors, field map events, hidden landmarks, a few side quests, and mini-games.\n\nSansara Naga's gameplay and gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dragon Quest I, Pokémon and Earthbound.\n\nThe Silver Mountains are also referred to as Heaven.","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27266":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Seikima II: Demon's Counterattack"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ISCO","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"560d4ceb-a7bc-4e60-ace1-71f46e1de596.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"73dc71cb-bc03-4a94-8c7a-e8dd45e77375.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"cab571b0-d1f7-4dab-b933-b7ab6f2e5e8d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"1959ddfa-ac5e-40cc-9cf1-72e809d09415.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"262a3d1a-8efb-4af3-9f3d-029b83826a90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"316720ac-6177-4649-9e88-9c8a21d98f2c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e91ba38b-cd5a-45e9-bb96-0d6e6d79477c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2650836a-ad37-4f79-96e6-dbf6f4746beb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"41e5ef4e-20bc-47c6-a76e-ceccda444373.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Seikima II: Akuma no Gyakushuu","Overview":"Players take control of Demon Kogure, a member of the real life Japanese heavy metal band Seikima-II. He is on a mission to rescue his fellow \"demon\" bandmates who have been captured and imprisoned by the God Zeus.\n\nThe game is broken up into four zones that are composed of eight areas each. In each area players have to collect all the visible items laying around to complete that area. Once all the items are collected in the seven areas of a zone, players can then enter the eighth area where they will find one of their bandmates locked inside a cage. After collecting all the items in the eighth zone, the player has to open the lids of three caskets. After the last casket is opened it will produce a key, which can then be used to release the locked up bandmate. While collecting all the visible items, players will be continuously attacked by enemies that they can either try to jump and dodge or shoot their projectile weapon at them.

The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.\n\nPlaying as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward.

Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...\n\nSquare no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with.\n\nWhen entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item, and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.","Publisher":"Square","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27285":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ebcc39ad-6209-489a-ba6c-9e3e37795ed8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ccfc9c57-8be1-4a1c-b8ef-e89ce13d3435.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"94daf4b0-51a2-4ebc-9817-b6f710340580.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8067090a-228f-49e9-b7a0-101e23d3e416.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a7f99293-d2ba-41b9-8b84-a0aa9687476f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"de04d629-1e52-4191-95d2-1e84dd8f5900.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"30a39ff3-2e32-4f70-b8f8-29e2ad84acac.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Luster","Overview":"In Star Luster, the player controls Dan Heinick, a pilot of the starfighter Gaia.

The game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.\n\nCombining hack & slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.\n\nThe game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FO51GpsnC3E","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Tower_of_Druaga"},"27326":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Sumo Wrestling!"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tecmo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b863a5f6-ad18-45c3-a28f-8ed8dd9500db.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"82cf0316-95dd-43c9-9cd5-eac74fc5e87b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e25ac7dc-3326-4d9c-82a7-501219f23231.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e2ce093c-9a44-434e-8c98-2521ecdb3e7d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tsuppari Oozumou","Overview":"Tsuppari Oozumou essentially means \"Shove Sumo\", Tsuppari being a move performed by Sumo wrestlers to push their opponent out of the ring. The game works like any other tournament-based fighter: The player character must fight a series of increasingly difficult opponents until they reach the top and are declared Yokozuna: The highest rank of Sumo.\n\nThe player has two moves at their disposal: A shove attack that will send an unprepared opponent reeling backwards and a grapple move that will wear down the opponent's stamina. With the judicious use of both attacks, the player must move the opponent to the edge of the ring and then find a way to push them out after draining their stamina.\n\nBetween matches the player can take part in training exercises, such as eating a lot of rice, in order to refill and increase the player character's stamina bar.","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"1987-09-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27327":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Delinquent Wars"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sammy Studios","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"47f85410-99bc-4ba6-a2fc-7512d9819ff6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b2109175-3f92-4071-9a0d-3dd601a2f7d0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"58e68274-7e81-4a5b-a491-2e5d607de010.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":3,"Name":"Tsuppari Wars","Overview":"Tsuppari Wars ( つっぱりウォーズ?, \"Delinquent Wars\") is an action video game for the Family Computer. The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games.\n\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \"Struggle\").\n\nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.\n\nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.","Publisher":"Sammy Studios","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tsuppari_Wars"},"27329":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaou","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaou"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"bbf3a835-a85a-4bed-ac74-e5c16ffd0736.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1b39ae2f-d11f-4805-8fa6-04a9b34f93d7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2ebd7596-f5a6-41eb-9b7e-cf7c662776c8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"daf4e6e1-dd63-459d-aed6-569e2abc4c96.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"351d8daa-65d9-4376-bd38-4301c7d1f0c9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee69a1a3-716e-4bdc-8f43-76fda660a7eb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4e3e13f3-430a-4790-82d1-44154f3c5544.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fe4b5b41-89da-465c-8f5a-625082bff6ef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō","Overview":"TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō (ツインビー３ ポコポコ大魔王 Tsuinbī Surī?, \"The Great Demon King Poko Poko\") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Konami originally released for the Famicom in 1989. It was the third game in the TwinBee series released for the Famicom, following the home version of the original TwinBee and the Famicom-exclusive Moero TwinBee. Unlike Moero, which was released in North America as Stinger, TwinBee 3 was a Japan-only release. It was re-released on April 14, 2006 as part of the i-Revo downloadable game service.\n\nTwinBee 3 ditches the side-scrolling stages from Stinger and only features top-scrolling ones similar to the original. Moreover, the game lacks the 3-Player mode from Moero, allowing only up to two players. The game is considerably easier than its predecessors due to an option mode that allows players to adjust the difficulty and number of ships, as well as the inclusion of the new \"soul reviving system\", which allows players to recover their power-ups after losing a ship.\n\nThe game uses digitized PCM voice samples, particularly when the conga music in one stage chants \"Poko Poko\", and in the beginning of each stage, in which a voice proclaims the name of the stage.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27330":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"SD Detective Blader"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NMK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"fd9959c8-2162-4a91-9bba-32d9a5c9b67d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"221c5476-780c-4539-966f-8e30dc6b5d28.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"de6f6da4-d268-4727-a419-0e142aae270a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SD Keiji: Blader","Overview":"SD Keiji: Blader is a Role-Playing game, developed by NMK and published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"27584":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"74913605-cf06-435f-8421-dc51b31c6294.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"62c6c67b-340a-4c62-8d58-3c60350886cc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"50dddbdd-07ab-40b7-98ff-c84763d9049c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ca79055c-c09b-4947-abf9-5f104a191131.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a54e144a-8e3d-477f-9f79-e062707f6f14.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"774aafb5-1aaa-42c4-bb65-4e30ffd60219.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1afdf6ee-f0f0-4780-9269-ed557dacdd06.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"67ec133d-0bb4-4cb9-8126-276cca4c85b4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rockman 4: Minus Infinity","Overview":"Made by talented ROM hacker: Puresabe, comes Rockman 4: Minus Infinity.

It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga.\n\nThe story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.\n\nKi has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds.\n\nMany of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items.

Airwolf is an horizontal shooter by Kyugo Boueki and based on the popular American television series aired in the 1980s. The player takes control of a super helicopter codenamed Airwolf, a military aircraft capable of supersonic speeds and stealth capabilities, and embarks on perilous undercover missions. Before each stage, the player is prompted to pick one primary air-weapon and a secondary ground-bomb. The primary weapon comes in three types - the Chain Gun fires straight ahead and at an angle, the Falcon fires small missiles and the Cannon. The same principle applies to ground-bombs and they come in three flavors - Red-Eye (bombs), Copperhead (missiles) and Hellfire (bullets). Pow icons are occasionally left behind enemy formations - they increase the equipped weapon's fire power and improve its firing rate. Finally, the Airwolf can fly at supersonic speed for a short amount of time and becomes invulnerable when it does. However, this technique consumes fuel and must be used with caution. Each level is essentially a linear path toward a large boss - interestingly, boss fights use a first-person view as opposed to side scrolling and losing even one means game over. In addition, the player is rewarded with a password after each completed level , however they are not used to save his progress but to unlock the game's ending - so they must be carefully written down and are randomly generated for each play session.","Publisher":"Kyugo Boueki","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9LoWhlw_ttI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Airwolf_(video_game)"},"32181":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Interactive Studios","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6681bbae-95b7-4d32-aa60-eee0671b397c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3633221a-eddc-47be-9171-c6331e92ebf9.png","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"450384d7-ed56-4ca7-9716-45b3b6a0e5c9.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"16643e8a-07d3-4066-bb00-4674f08f9d97.png","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"d4d785f7-372c-48fc-a929-1adac27a1546.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9b13a1d5-f6e2-4fbd-971d-5c4565bc5f60.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c5cabd95-b371-4444-a621-9335556dfb78.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bfe92aed-a28f-4abb-b7cf-89397928e5e4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"16b7daaf-94d2-4091-a536-32d67813c763.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"63314040-14b2-48ec-9814-b2bd16627157.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wonderland Dizzy","Overview":"Dizzy and Daisy gazed down into the darkness below.

The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=97XMk6z80b0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ys_III:_Wanderers_from_Ys"},"32565":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Street Fighter II: The World Warrior"},{"AlternateName":"Super Fighter II"},{"AlternateName":"Master Fighter II"},{"AlternateName":"Master Fighter III"},{"AlternateName":"Street Fighter 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hummer Team","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"af38a14e-73bc-44be-b892-327a2d3dc89a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ac0ee94-908c-4694-8194-9f7c1c509247.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5ac9a92-f15a-4838-acde-1726731e1d2d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eaea4318-c388-4a01-b695-4d4e33118c93.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c8409958-ed21-470e-b43c-c2c25b0bef62.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e705a5ec-4549-4bea-8aa4-c06e27a89e04.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0b68e375-380f-4f3c-a369-1e1b21104ebb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"965cfd2b-141c-467e-a27b-8f5624907e49.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4f877831-eb1c-41a1-bb95-eb34c4b3fbfc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Street Fighter II","Overview":"Street Fighter II also known as Master Fighter II: The World Warrior is a 2D Fighting game, published by Xoxo Soft, which was released in Asia in 1992.

No plans have been announced regarding a true cartridge release for this game as of yet, so until then enjoy this one in a Nintendo NES emulator.","Publisher":"Pixellevel","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EuIuxivrcKU"},"33924":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"mojontwins","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a36fb24a-db3d-49cc-9366-771497a2e26d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"aa05987d-cbc9-483a-9969-f4170720ee25.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"94476124-5f60-4d02-beec-f0dc1efe54df.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c9f2122-30e4-45b9-8aa6-e3ed11dedcbd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cfb926c1-38af-4351-b560-974064021ef2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"612bce25-9b84-4e73-ae4d-40f78f67db3f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"46daf99c-2451-40d0-ba69-1176ff38450a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"594cda53-0270-46a5-b97d-3ffb59986149.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sir Ababol","Overview":"Sir Ababol controlled through the Monegros for all ababoles.

The game modes included are:\n\nDecimal Multiplication - Players control a spaceship in a side-scrolling shooter. Blasting enemy ships earns the player points. At certain intervals, the ship will land in front of a building and the pilot enters a room. In the room, the player is presented with a multiplication problem that involves decimals. Players have to select the correct numbers that solve the problem while also dodging bullets being fired by gun turrets. Solving the problem correctly will let the player move on to the next stage.\n\nDecimal Division - This mode features the same gameplay as the Decimal Multiplication mode, except instead of solving a multiplication problem, the player is solving a division problem that involves decimals.\n\nFraction Addition & Subtraction - Players control a girl on a field. Players are presented with a fraction addition or subtraction problem depending on the chosen mode. To solve this problem players have to first water the seeds that are on the ground. Watering seeds will eventual turn them into red or white flowers, which will eventually become ball shaped if continually watered. Once the flowers are ball shaped they can be pushed into a numbered basket, but only the white flowers should be and not the red ones, as the red ones are more of an obstacle and will affect the player negatively if they are placed into a basket. The number on the basket represents the number the player is selecting to solve the math problem. Players also have to be careful not to get hit by any of the animals roaming around in the field. The player is equipped with a spray that can temporarily stun the enemies if they get too close.\n\nFraction Multiplication & Division - This mode features the same gameplay as the Fraction Addition & Subtraction mode, except instead of solving addition & subtraction problems,the player is solving either an multiplication or division problem (depending on which mode they have chosen) that involves fractions.\n\nEach minigame has different difficulty levels and also allows for two player alternating play.","Publisher":"Tokyo Shoseki","ReleaseDate":"1986-10-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"94322":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atlus","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"acc002a6-fe23-4078-b294-de58caaaa0b8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"624908b4-218a-42d7-be38-d42b0afdb6c4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"989a7335-a7af-4cad-aee4-1fa5c2d14529.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8bbd447b-0fb2-4cc5-bb48-780e55551bf7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"King of Kings","Overview":"A fantasy-themed strategy.

The player is required to complete 25 lines before advancing to the next level.","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fs0oCVjjMf0"},"98694":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Idea-Tek","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c09eaef0-dd3e-4273-ac1e-1f4bb205faa5.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c8f0bd30-1597-4108-8fc6-b54fbc3bcee2.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ade5718f-abf8-4ece-a6a3-1162b83fd69c.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d1d2fbe2-ee06-4065-86ca-32d2d4601532.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a4e90442-4e19-48bd-af16-667b04a748a8.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8a9e89ba-8d61-48b9-bfa7-945ef63786ee.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AV Hanafuda Club","Overview":"AV Hanafuda Club is an unlicensed game based on the card game hanafuda, and is one of the games in the Famicom's AV series.

After setting as many parameters as you like, you can start the race and see which horse wins. There is no winning or losing from your perspective (none of the horses are \"yours\", and you don't get to place any bets or anything), you just change parameters and see what happens.

A special set of Barcode Battler cards with barcodes imprinted on them were also required to play the game including the \"White Card\" that enabled players to scan any barcode (especially ones found on consumer products).\n\nBarcode World includes barcode cards that feature characters from many Sunsoft series, most notably Hebereke and Gimmick!, however using the White Card included with the game, players were also given the ability to scan a wide range of consumer products. Released during a period of great interest in barcode-swiping games in Japan, the game dates itself as directly from the early 1990s, however the game still functions today exactly as it did then and modern products may also be scanned in order to generate new content for the game (RPG-style stats and attributes, etc.).","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barcode_World"},"98829":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coconuts Japan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"9e633f9c-5d1b-43ee-a6e1-8264458c67fe.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a23bb306-21d2-4eb4-b6d8-139154e8ae52.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"64333087-e9ed-4fac-b3c7-315e02393ac1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"ace08766-f330-4ce4-bd8c-aca82d88c142.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7e943223-ec50-47d8-92b5-65583a5f2948.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a7da7a37-f7b8-4fa4-9d33-dec894a50924.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Bakushou!!

You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser – whatever he (or it) is.\n\nThe game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on \"jump & run\" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.\n\nBashi Bazook: Morphoid Masher was going to be the North American name, but it was never released. The idea fell through due to its similarity to Xexyz and the game remained in Japan. However, the game was completed, and ROMs of the game are widely circulated on the Internet.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1987-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R4u-fIGHG-o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bio_Senshi_Dan:_Increaser_to_no_Tatakai"},"103662":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"High Level Challenge","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"75c475a3-43dd-4467-bc23-d02e28af14f5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0916a596-73c1-4b8e-b8b9-d461613fb910.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"428c4353-44e0-45b9-a85f-6744ff62f16d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8b823575-b519-4845-9022-87df682bccaf.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9d3d3a90-03f9-4548-be37-fd0f3c4b54a7.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"85db151d-f3f3-41c4-807d-08b35b590608.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"32c8ba7d-23e6-4ff6-a0aa-a325592d3082.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"083a962d-38c8-4802-baee-f1e16a1cb72b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c2095712-5a00-439c-8e07-2fff31b0ab6c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5547bbdd-5fb1-421b-84d2-1755070185a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4271a49d-9c31-4ff7-89ab-024ddff16077.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Blade Buster","Overview":"Blade Buster is a homebrew game for NES.

In regular Tetris, the player manipulates a set of tetrominoes which fall into a two-dimensional pit (seen from the side). The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces. Similarly, in Blockout, the player manipulates a set of polycubes which fall into a three-dimensional pit (seen from above; the pieces appear in the foreground and fall away). The pieces can be rotated around all three axes, and moved horizontally and vertically. The aim is to form complete layers\n\nThe NES version of Block Out is nearly exactly the same as the versions released on other platforms, however was based on Technos arcade rendition of the original, which offered features like a two-player co-op mode. The controls are a little different this time around, when you take into consideration the number of keys on a computer keyboard when compared to the buttons on an NES controller. But if you have ever played the version for the Atari Lynx or the Sega Genesis, you know how the controls can be. It just takes some time to learn them.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ghSipca0gfY"},"103939":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Brush Roller","Region":"Asia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NTDEC","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f2232d54-22ff-4b08-b48b-80b0629ae8fe.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3bcd3913-f806-47e8-9d77-3473bf8f9cea.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f96c6ba9-1415-487c-a1cd-a28beb8cf9d1.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e17767a-0357-4871-8683-0085fe330c42.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cb312026-6d92-4d27-a264-142e00c2c43b.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6774b8a4-b41f-46e0-9d64-cac467c3ca02.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"29856221-8685-423e-9edb-766b0877649b.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e08ad15e-38be-4c2f-9301-476482f6a8ac.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"048e0d0b-1845-4e32-a056-9655d36c4fdd.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"23e18e1f-e256-40df-a81a-f4ab2c515858.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1f6fe00a-6f9d-4bf6-b29e-a54c1ae502ea.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Booky Man","Overview":"in this community lived a rat, a beetle called Booky Man, two lizards and a bug.

There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.\n\nTetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.\n\nBomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.\n\nBomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-13T00:00:00-08:00"},"118545":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Neal Tew","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fabf82df-eea9-4e9e-a953-d95676376ab0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ff546885-8619-4642-92e5-30956f270e3e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c09d9973-ce64-4162-93dc-27b9ec594832.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ebb4cefd-7fac-43c9-a5b2-754d023fe270.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"191c7d51-1f57-4440-b4aa-094e0463c9bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Box Boy","Overview":"Created for the 2003 MiniGames Compo.\n\nArrange the colored boxes in the correct order!

It is one of the few games for the Famicom that was developed in South Korea. This game was better well-known as its unreleased, American version known as Buzz & Waldog.\n\nThe game stars two characters, Koko and Suzi, who shares the same abilities. You can either play as either one in single player or both in multiplayer. There's 3 levels in each stage as well as a boss fight. There's 5 stages overall and after that, you fight all the bosses again before confronting the final boss. There's also question mark boxes around that you can break to get points, gems, a time increase, 1-ups or a power-up. The power-up can either grant you the ability to double jump and if you already have that, the ability to let you glide in the air.\n\nKoko Adventure was later changed and was supposed to be released by Innovation Technology in 1993 but due to unknown reasons, it never was along with some of Open Corp.'s other games. In this version, Suzi is replaced with a male character known as Waldog and the title screen was changed. (although her name remains on the game over screen through cheating\/hacking). That version also features infinite lives, which was likely intended for debugging and testing.","Publisher":"Daou Infosys","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Sb9KXViuILg"},"118803":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Go!

You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath.

The amount of steps is determined randomly: a spinning indicator will eventually stop on one of the numbers, from 1 to 6, similar to a dice roll.

Most of those events will modify your character's parameters.

As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.\n\n\n\nTwo modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. \n\n\n\nMode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in match or quest mode.","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseDate":"1991-05-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Palamedes_(video_game)#Ports"},"127444":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mario Azevedo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"3a775607-3622-4586-8561-dc58aa8b32b8.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c551c9f7-d97a-4692-bc3d-586447b07a93.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d7d3d021-d7c6-4fdd-a0a1-2526d51da5ce.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"068df1cf-7aba-423d-8570-777ff8aff7fb.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f8e86ef1-39e0-4b11-b528-1f41645ae753.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4f0bdbfd-7241-44b2-b4cc-53c64a3b5345.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Pitfall: 30th Anniversary Edition","Overview":"Romhack \/ total conversion of Super Pitfall 1 for Famicom\/NES","Publisher":"Mario Azevedo","ReleaseDate":"2016-09-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack"},"127600":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NTDEC","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"268c0f9b-0175-4776-b899-9b2f584e1723.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8bcb0cdd-9ae5-4e2e-8b25-28685d700175.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"def88949-edd2-4193-b599-391eb17721e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"497b604b-17e7-4cc0-bd1b-cc450f29f548.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hot Dance 2000","Overview":"The concept of the main game is based on the popular Dance Dance Revolution video game.

A general business meeting is always held on the beginning of April as a measure to set things like employment levels, executive salaries, and financial benefits for the employees. Meetings held every other month focus on spreading advertisement throughout Japan, improving the performance of the products, and determining how many products to manufacture for sale on the open market.\n\nThe game is mostly text-based and players can choose between five major electronics companies to play as (IBN, Pujitsu, Tochiba, Charp and NEG, parodying IBM, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Sharp, and NEC).

Optomon has done all the coding, music, and some level design, and I’ve done all the graphics, some level design, and the map. \n\n–STORY–\n\n1476, Romania. A terrifying castle rises up from the mist. Along with the castle rose a dark powerful being named Count Dracula Vlad Tepes. A man named Trevor Belmont was fated to defeat the powerful vampire, aided by a witch named Sypha, Dracula’s own son Alucard, and a pirate named Grant DeNasty. Together the team traversed the dark halls of Castlevania, defeating the count and his countless minions.\n\nIn 1777 a young child was born, and abandoned on a merchant ship with nothing but a headband with a mysterious crest, and the name Armund. The sailors raised the child on the high seas, and taught him the ways of being a sailor. Armund grew to be one of the greatest men that the merchant ship ever saw.\n\nLate 1797, word started to spread of the legends of Count Dracula, and his tyranny in the land of Romania. It was about that time, that Armund ran into an old Romanian man in Serbia. The old man knew a lot about the history of Count Dracula, and his reign of terror in Romania. The old man recognized the crest on Armund’s bandanna, and told him that it belonged to the DeNasty clan, and that his ancestor helped defeat Dracula. Armund decided to leave his life on the high seas to seek out more answers about his ancestry.\n\nRomania, 1800. It’s been 3 years since Alucard defeated his father in battle and has gone into eternal slumber. Armund’s search has taken him to the mountains of Romania, not far from the town of Jova.

It takes place on the Official \"VHL\" (Video Hockey League) ice rink pitting the Reds (left side) against the Blues (right side). Each team is made up of three players -- two forwards and a goal tender. The object of the game is to shoot the puck into the other team's goal.\n\nThe game offers fights, trips, body slams, shattering glass, blazing shots, head-over-heels bone crushing hits, hacking, slashing, spearing, elbowing and all out knock-down, punching, crunching action. You don't need to know any rules about hockey to enjoy Hit The Ice -- the ultimate red-blooded sport. There is fast paced end to end action, heart stopping incredible saves, booming slapshots, impossible in-the-air 360 degree cartwheel supershots all with some good natured humor thrown in.\n\nPlayers can purchase Power Drinks in the locker room between periods for an additional credit. The drink promises \"Skate Faster, Shoot Harder, It really, Really works!\" At the start of the next period the player will undergo a wild cartoon-like transformation that turns the character into a maniac for the next minute of play.\n\nThe game was briefly reviewed in Nintendo Power Volume 47 and was scheduled for release in April 1993. Conversely, it was reviewed again in the next issue and slated for a May 1993 release. It then received a full review in Volume 49. Ultimately, the game was never officially published.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S4PBcMP8kvk"},"130978":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Grimlock","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"1a842865-1885-465d-9163-883d52410a5f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ecd0772-827d-4f0f-beba-c9c31cd54e16.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b86c8509-745a-4ba6-9783-6520c264c4b1.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7d8ec719-76f2-47a9-9b26-87edadcb3b03.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4675f074-3e8a-4865-9496-37f3bca16d15.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8426bc37-c3f0-4893-abc9-aac50f892a8a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"128c60d4-0476-4c14-926c-ff1a7e12ff8a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8ba93ed3-756a-4e95-9077-820ea5ec7e4d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Metroid: Rogue Dawn","Overview":"Metroid: Rogue Dawn is an unofficial prequel to the original Metroid game released in 1986. 30 years later, this fan-made game brings to light the events that unfolded just before Samus's epic \"zero\" mission on planet Zebes.\n\nThe original Metroid manual tells us about a deep-space research ship that was attacked.

Byrnes requested some last minute changes before the game shipped, American Video Entertainment folded, and Cue Stick was canned. Odyssey Software survived for a few more years before they met a similar fate.\n\nThe game is filled with tons of features. There are four different modes of play including Straight Pool and Nine Ball, a trainer mode, and several table colors to choose from. There are also several different frictions (or lack of) that you can add to the table, including ice and sand. This option gives the balls a slightly different behavior, increasing the challenge.\n\nGame is viewed similarly to Side Pocket.

Originally started as a homebrew NES demake of Grand Theft Auto III, it was eventually developed into a full game. The game is set in eighties and the protagonist is a mullet-styled gangster who wreaks havoc in Theftropolis city. It draws many elements from the series it was inspired by, such as the ability to hijack any car, fight on foot with melee and ranged weapons, and shake off the law when too many crimes are committed.\n\nThe main story mode consists of a number of missions that involve heists, extortion, but for instance also helping out Doc Brown from the Back to the Future movies to help repair his time travel car. The game has a quirky style and hectic pace, and is filled to the brim references to popular culture, especially movies, celebrities and other games with many cameo appearances. Next to the main mission various side missions can be taken on or the city can be explored in full at the player's leisure. During certain parts 30 challenges can be triggered where an objective needs to be completed in a short time, such as driving around a tank or getting air time shooting a bazooka. These can later be replayed as arcade challenges from the main menu. In addition there is a free roaming mode with the maximum amount of money right from the start.","Publisher":"Vblank Entertainment Inc.","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Retro_City_Rampage"},"133226":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CMUnesDEV Team","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"d01b5c8c-8afe-4d85-b5a2-afa98884b053.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"633d2a11-e7f3-4c51-945a-417279ab6c9e.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"60d3971d-d3c2-4871-9747-4b703af0c6fd.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"31358012-ddc9-4847-8d51-5051353c20ec.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"0b4adea9-3ca2-4879-8ca5-56ec5886ff8e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sack of Flour: Heart of Gold","Overview":"This is a homebrew demo by Bob Rost.

Helmet was rolling snots with his pinky while feeling incredibly bored and disatisfied with the training methods used in his base. Mind you, he was a proud member of the top-3 thoughtest people on Earth alongside Chuck Norris and Katheleen Turner, and, in his opinion, jumping trampolines using jumping flip-flops and rolling under barbed wire in the mud was kind of depressing.\n\nThat’s why fellow warriors Sgt. Pepperpot, Col. Miguel and Alm. Adamant designed an all-new training field for their good fellow Sgt. Helmet so he could properly train for an always possible, upcoming war or rugby match.\n\nThe very day Jimmy the Lemur, his own pet, became of age (do the math: 15 lemurean years equal 4 dog years), the fellow warriors had something for Helmet: he got his eyes blindfolded, his lips rouged, and dressed with a cute blue taffeta blouse with matching skirt. Then he was told “we are sending you to a suicide mission to Kartadmocia – but before you have to pay us a little favor: set five bombs in the Defence Ultra Large Level computer, the DULL, and the come back to the base. Like?”. Still astonished, while inspecting the field maps about the location of the DULL computer, Helmet answered “Like”.\n\nThen, Helmet kissed Jimmy goodbye while he was putting out the last candle in the cake, carefully folded the taffeta clothes and put them back for more important commitments, put on his military boots (one marked with a red tag, other with a green one, so he would not be confused on which to put in each foot) and namesake helmet, and got ready for the mission!","Publisher":"The Mojon Twins","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2013},"133228":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"38e0934d-8c91-45b3-8edc-94066c2c47cf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f3e0b9e9-5dfd-430b-b76e-82292ce1d1ef.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"8a6e339d-2bba-45e5-a2d2-64154d17b59b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c009d54-35af-484c-8170-01412020f972.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d297245f-e694-4768-ba1a-818957910337.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ccab347c-f9d6-4c1f-8eee-19962ac2b53b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cf764f27-6267-424f-9267-88438dde134c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3915f598-f64a-40e2-90dc-3bf531a1fbf6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier","Overview":"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was a 2D platform game which was developed by Bandai for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).

If one of them lands on a house or silo, the missile and target are destroyed.","Publisher":"Damian Yerrick","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"133235":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Music; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"85a9566d-f244-4d17-962a-6d245ef3a8cd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ab48f678-063e-43c0-bd6d-d33b7da802aa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8921ccc3-28cc-4ded-95e6-dbb86a72565f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"7ed942d3-8ec6-4582-b85b-1e72887da9f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e59c3c0f-5d89-4513-9167-718710f81aad.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"79a3b20f-246c-40cb-8b87-1e6db9581b4f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"cf9e0d57-e51c-48b2-9a2a-a3dc49a35416.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"27e1e891-7079-41e8-9f45-eaa4213c0459.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab2f5de9-a7e6-47fa-abd8-2237c042dc9f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"543dd56c-1c59-4d31-8700-0fcf55e5dd83.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c3f4b11d-f6d9-4a98-bf59-08ae0a4b1d78.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6e0f7ac1-a6db-422a-adb1-986060cde46e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"U-Force Power Games","Overview":"U-Force Power Games is a collection of games that never saw release.

This 8-bit \"port\" was developed and published by Chinese company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology for the Subor, a Nintendo Famicom clone.\n\nIn 2013, a hack was released by members of the Romhacking.net community, which overhauled the game and improved upon its gameplay and graphics to more closely resemble the PSone classic. It features a three-member party structure and several adaptations of the game's subsystems. Items, spells and equipment are based upon those found in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted, along with optional characters and some side quests, the full story remains faithfully intact.\n\nThe game has received praise from various sources, though initially criticized for its difficulty. Journalist Derrick Sobodash stated that while it would not be an entirely new experience for those that played the original Final Fantasy VII, \"this title can hold its own against the other NES Final Fantasy games\", describing the effort as \"surprisingly professional\". Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett cited the Famicom game as \"an achievement I have no hesitation in labeling Herculean\", further calling it \"...a triumph of the human spirit\". Boing Boing Gadgets and Wired News writer Joel Johnson described the game as \"more than just a knock-off — it's an act of true skill and commitment by an unknown team of Chinese coders\". GamePro named it one of the thirteen best fan-made remakes, placing first on their list and describing it as \"the video game equivalent of the Human Genome Project\", despite its flaws.","Publisher":"Romhacking.net","ReleaseDate":"2013-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=foY1eCqXP5g"},"133521":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tierheit","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"459e7378-3cf7-459e-b216-66413ca02e25.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"007156f4-0abe-4947-bf83-4f52d5b3e8d3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3ab69b89-6be5-4675-a90e-a401149c0cad.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88c0873e-bae0-4f5d-b5e5-786115ef552d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e12abde2-985c-46d2-99ab-15b5e71ead44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"11aa91e1-29cf-4d54-b8e2-702462866925.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1d004374-05f5-402b-94c3-259910a2e0a4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3dc97553-d32e-47bc-9253-f4c7f0adfc1f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pescatore","Overview":"Pescatore is a puzzle game, developed by Tierheit and meant to be published by Sunsoft.

He then provides an introductory story for Xuanzang, the main character in Journey to the West, and the Buddha's instruction for Guanyin, where he must find someone to carry the Buddhist sutras back to the east. Xuanzang was chosen for the task of bringing the Buddhist sutras from the West to the east. Guanyin also traveled to find bodyguards for Xuanzang to follow him west. All the companions agreed to serve Xuanzang as a way to atone for past sins. Sun Wukong was the first disciple to join the journey, although his violence was constantly reprimanded by Xuanzang. There are two menus in this game. The first menu is which character to start with, but it's not too important since you can change the character during the game. The second menu appears when you have lost all your lives and have to continue.","Publisher":"Micro Genius","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1994,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BZbBjGgV_X8"},"133619":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"13fa9f22-f476-4267-9769-3a26562b3d4a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9963643-5435-4490-b6da-4c1cab286592.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7be18741-3980-451d-8e87-3b4c2953bd45.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d1660169-b8d6-4c6b-b419-19c2e6192092.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c50c6b68-2d83-4731-a099-a981febf7c7f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fd17b39e-f9b4-4d02-bbe3-d6ec94e07ff6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation","Overview":"Kabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation (\"Kabushiki\" is the Japanese stock market, and \"doujou\" is, of course, dojo) is a stock trading simulation game, where the aim is to invest wisely in the stock market and develop a bountiful portfolio.

Gunjin Shougi: Nanya Sore!?","Overview":"Kaettekita! Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces).\n\nWhen one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.","Publisher":"Sofel","ReleaseDate":"1989-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iA8hrdxczr8"},"133621":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"d&d Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"ea25a8a2-d836-4c94-87c2-9cda2c015f28.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"39adc389-3e55-4b28-a392-3b374a09fc20.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a7690d69-111c-4a7d-ab9f-f344e2efcc7a.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eadf28ac-aaaa-4a99-9b7e-6f15252b29a8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0c5db150-d88d-4f88-bd5d-c70e390f2a92.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a6117f56-b6c9-410c-9a89-2ecf31a50b51.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kamen Rider SD: Granshocker no Yabou","Overview":"Kamen Rider SD: Granshocker no Yabou is a digital board game with RPG elements based on the Kamen Rider SD manga and is a part of the Kamen Rider universe.\n\nThere are three teams to choose the characters from: Battle Team (Kamen Rider 1, Kamen Rider ZX, Kamen Rider Black RX), Wild Team (Kamen Rider 2, Kamen Rider Amazon, Kamen Rider Stronger), Mechanic Team (Kamen Rider V3, Kamen Rider X, Kamen Rider Super-1).

For instance, the archers can aim for any of the four rows of enemy forces, though front-line melee fighters are far more limited.","Publisher":"Gakken","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=drCD7qBHexI"},"133678":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Winkysoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"f4ba1ee4-be54-4d9a-bff9-70353eda6b29.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4bc5dda9-abaf-471b-bc12-a9acd466b15a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6690e0d5-f703-4cd8-9444-ffffe517e584.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"39984bd2-5aeb-450b-a87f-0aebe04a3eb0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"66c72964-0094-428c-937b-496b6e8c5a41.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"67ddd82a-c766-43f8-b036-1fc1d6a85c9c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"My Life My Love: Boku no Yume: Watashi no Negai","Overview":"My Life My Love: Boku no Yume Watashi no Negai (or \"My Life My Love: My Dreams My Desires\") is a board style game for the Famicom.

The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:\n\n- Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.\n- Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the animé's characters.\n- Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.\n- Figure out the differences between similar pictures.\n- Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike Minesweeper).","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133741":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"1c55d210-a506-4dde-b9fb-259ecc364550.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d3291cd4-d1f0-4fb7-8b33-2878188a5808.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3e9efd9c-a707-459d-aa8c-a867cdac1414.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c32d9e35-85a5-48c8-b1ee-157169a5fc22.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0c17ada3-8e81-4cf0-8fc7-561756bfd618.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5a5f1a3b-1ef5-4f94-859d-b139d7287c8b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Oeka Kids: Anpanman to Oekaki Shiyou!!","Overview":"Tablet-based drawing game.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133742":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!?","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NMK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d83c4c6c-d4c9-439c-9dd6-f789f192648d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f3eba26b-052e-4a29-86e7-5a93cf530027.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f7dda28-1749-49c3-b5d6-d26b02f6294d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9cc05703-6ba3-40b3-9ed2-b61290d93260.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1a3d4d45-71c5-4089-88ee-a07771c14b97.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"14393116-152f-43d5-93b9-c99cfc56e57c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!?","Overview":"Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!?

One or two players can compete for dominance in one of the country's most turbulent epochs. Players can choose to control one of the seven available historical warlords, including Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and others.\n\nThe turn-based game is menu-driven for the most part; the player views the map of China and issues orders in the name of the chosen warlord until his turn is over. The player must take care of his state's interior politics, keeping the citizens happy and the army strong, acquiring weapons and food, and engaging in diplomatic missions.\n\nWhen the player sends an army to conquer a neighboring land, or is himself attacked by another warlord, the interface switches to top-down, and a tactical battle begins. The player must positions his troops on the battlefield, and navigate them towards the enemies. When two units meet, an automatic skirmish ensues. The battle is over when one of the sides has eliminated the other completely, surrendered, or conquered the enemy's stronghold.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133769":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"三国志：中原之霸者","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TOSE","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"1abd3cbd-416a-4b4e-a2c9-20c9374ffb46.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ef349ab4-18ad-4799-a2cf-0a3231450529.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"103145f8-cf5b-4dc5-932e-91a10941bdb5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9b3d440a-34d2-4425-b543-cd3962241fda.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aa94e099-e6e0-4dce-9a75-eb46cbd791fd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"61151a6d-9e1d-4baa-b29d-b7adb046c8b1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sangokushi: Chuugen no Hasha","Overview":"Sangokushi refers to a novel written about the Three Kingdoms period of China, where the country was temporarily split into three warring states.

Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation.\n\nThe game itself plays much like Dragon Quest: a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs. The player can walk around towns conversing with NPCs, equipping themselves with weapons and armor and receiving quests and directions to new areas before leaving the safety of the town to fight random encounters on the overworld map that links locations together. Combat follows the tactical turn-based pattern, allowing the player input their characters' desired actions before watching each turn play out. Most of the enemies in the game are based on classical Japanese monsters, usually youkai.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1989-01-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133771":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Scarabeus","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Source","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"208f24b5-4424-4221-b5cf-71ce3288e1ba.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7db1a5a4-5567-4e42-87bc-48d78f5ee8cb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f22572b8-fa63-4fe0-9c1d-ded72acd1476.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1310449a-c7c4-45b9-807d-b39820e1f6fd.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4a8ddafe-bfb8-4b86-b111-f17ecd76a9cf.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e437a9b0-7329-4417-86ed-93c2e0aa9698.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6cf734b3-c0e2-47e5-92ec-02ca0e0df69f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pyramids of Ra","Overview":"THE MAZE CRAZY PUZZLE CHALLENGE THAT WILL AMAZE YOU!\n\nWeave your way through the maze of passages which takes you within the ancient tombs and causeways of the Pharaohs.

In particular, the game is based on the 1983 live-action movie, localized in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai which in turn was based on a 1982 reworking of the epic novel named Shin Satomi Hakkenden.\n\nThe game has a then-distinct feature of being able to start the game as any of the eight samurai, each of which begins the game in a different location. Their goal is to meet up and recruit their brothers, eventually forming a group of eight. The game is otherwise standard for the genre: the player splits their time between exploring towns and talking to NPCs, and fighting monsters and enemy soldiers in dungeons and the overworld map via a turn-based combat system.","Publisher":"Toei Animation","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fr3UiAo2YkM"},"133786":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hect","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"9225ddf5-389c-42b4-b06e-f9ae2bd907ac.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e1d43bc0-dca4-484e-9e6b-c0e6f3790663.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e3819c86-0000-4820-998d-af46aa6ee484.JPG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d99fc3d0-c798-4f29-959c-c8be3c2d2360.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ec43bfb1-c3b8-4335-8241-39b59dd58f92.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aa38613c-d24f-4df4-936e-7beb9dd9e5ef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shougi Meikan '92","Overview":"Shogi Meikan '92 is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Publisher":"Hect","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8NC5dJPzva0"},"133787":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hect","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"b53e6e28-1781-4151-86c4-c3077b0b5641.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d30da957-30ad-4ebf-be7b-9e63665cceef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e62ef7f-a372-4d0f-b64e-6b33fa451d15.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5e7ef11c-6cd5-4d11-ba13-086a81420d3f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bf10e6ef-f080-4ebd-96b0-8b55ea35b3da.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d4fab867-874c-4cef-96b0-ddd0408da962.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shougi Meikan '93","Overview":"Shogi Meikan '93 is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Publisher":"Hect","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133788":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Graphic Research","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"081f1e3f-06c8-4bfb-88c0-822f94024b8a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"821d27df-6521-4c40-ad57-40cfda855ced.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"531f9316-4d02-4534-b2ee-94d11705d680.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"29dc7a63-d969-47b9-9214-acbb3f84c02a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d89854c0-148a-48d6-a84d-68ec060ecdce.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ed1ba4da-569b-4539-8042-94e945ed83d3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shoukoushi Ceddie","Overview":"Shoukoushi Cedie is the Japanese title of the 1886 Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a down-to-earth kid from New York discovering his heritage as the heir to an Earldom in England, moving to his inherited estate and learning how to become a nobleman. Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American\/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master).\n\nThe game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.","Publisher":"Fuji Television","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133789":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"180af279-136f-40f0-bf93-d7e58fad72a3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c1728eb2-7dd8-4c71-b891-904eda3281b0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef3f136f-24c4-4009-935d-65b1a4053a36.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"53171f43-d61c-4b37-88d6-deab0d9895c3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"90d8f97a-480e-4e7c-989d-edca7edfe7bc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6c31ff4a-e76b-43f6-ae68-5054e0783ebd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shounen Ashibe: Nepal Daibouken no Maki","Overview":"Shounen Ashibe: Nepal Daibouken no Maki is an Adventure game, developed by Advance Communication Company and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Publisher":"Takara","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tYSHA16Frdo"},"133790":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Shuang Xiang Pao","Region":"Asia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bit Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"b80b24dd-c2ce-4195-bc46-b6a396cf79de.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b5ebf140-4207-45f3-81c3-2f18649289bb.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6efc6e1c-4993-4cfb-875e-bddd38391ba2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a1b708a2-9f34-4a80-9a30-5b0df3fc5abe.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f71bc36e-c637-4b77-a72b-5e67cc4b5477.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b761ec63-e1f3-418c-aeda-b31ac3c77923.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sheng Hen Pao","Overview":"Sheng Hen Pao is a Casino game, developed and published by Bit Corp., which was released in Asia in 1988.","Publisher":"Bit Corp.","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1988},"133794":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"6ba1dd61-d1e3-49f1-a626-8e25fb08bc60.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"42e4becb-ae01-48b4-b70b-85ee284be829.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"25e07328-5926-494b-8c6b-3aa1db84f4cc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c6609763-117f-48f5-93ce-d0ae6de7151b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Study Box","Overview":"The StudyBox, released by Fukutake Publishing Co, Ltd., was much like a tape player for the Famicom.

Later stages switch the moles with other animals and characters to quickly bop.\n\nThe game was released with a rubber mallet and a special smaller Power Pad peripheral (known in Japan as the Family Trainer) with a grid of buttons that corresponded to the holes that the moles would emerge from. Because the Power Pad had twelve buttons, the different stages could be configured differently: for instance, the first level had a ring of eight buttons on the right side of the pad, whereas the next level included the left, right, and bottom row of buttons to form its eight around an island in a U shape.","Publisher":"IGS","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/P0Zs8kEBsyY?t=1405"},"133809":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"af495211-5029-4836-8a8a-b11979df643b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8afc8f3a-8ba1-465f-9792-27323730ec52.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d7fd2d5-b3c9-43d6-9d98-a07ec47a52cf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"10a6cc18-3f98-46cf-b705-a35800140b46.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bb23babc-13a2-499d-ae79-911fc12b3088.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c2979632-2d9e-45d4-93fe-435a028b9db8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Super Momotarou Dentetsu","Overview":"Super Momotarou Dentetsu is a train and conveyance-based board game with financial elements that features Hudson's Momotarou character, based on the Japanese folklore hero of the same name.

Like typical mahjong games, players receive and discard tiles until they complete hands by forming groups and pairs.

It also has a considerable amount of text.\n\nPlayers move around towns from a top-down perspective, going left or right as well as up and down. They can fight other characters on the screen (not all of which are hostile) as well as enter houses and stores to talk to NPCs or purchase items from them.

There is also a roulette mini-game, and a chance board there players can pick random prizes. The goal is to be the first player to amass a certain amount of net worth, then return to the bank.

It is better known outside of Japan for its heavy North American localization (known as Dragon Power).\n\nBased on the Dragon Ball manga and anime, the game follows young monkey-tailed boy Goku as he embarks on a quest (along with teenage companion Bulma and shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong) to find all seven Dragon Balls, believing that collecting them grants them any wish they desire. While the first half of the game follows the early parts of the original series (culminating in the \"Emperor Pilaf Saga\"), the second half of the game follows an original storyline (first involving a martial arts tournament, then involving Goku's search for his grandfather's keepsake Dragon Ball).\n\nWhile general exploration and combat is done in an overhead perspective, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective for key battles.\n\nThe game was later released in North America in March 1988 as Dragon Power, removing numerous references to the Dragon Ball series while changing the names and appearances of most characters. The game was also released in France in 1990 as Dragon Ball (also known in-game as Dragon Ball: Le Secret du Dragon) with all references intact.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1986-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Bgdu6UOzCm4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Dragon_Ball_video_games#1980s"},"135286":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"C&E","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"c7bf73ee-f9fb-43c0-a0f2-6ec063044ace.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"032f77b9-d227-4190-a310-15e1ea05f286.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"25420627-8ebd-443f-87ce-ac45399c59cd.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"20052ae7-452b-4764-8cae-ea227f194b52.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e500a58-f7ff-4683-b065-56644b6d31bc.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f2522403-5a6d-4909-b89c-8aed083cdeaa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AV Super Real Pachinko","Overview":"AV Pachinko also known as AV Super Real Pachinko is an adult Pachinko simulation game developed by C&E and published by Hacker International in 1991.","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XKkrCmD5jOQ"},"135359":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Daou Infosys","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"79936dd2-ac0a-4ec1-bb13-bc2bf5912457.jpg","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4901368f-2c03-48b1-bf86-620987567ff9.png","Region":"Korea","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cdeaee8b-bac9-4483-bd01-974908c20afc.png","Region":"Korea","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c9ad9423-8644-4d48-82ac-539e8dc7cb68.png","Region":"Korea","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dooly Bravo Land","Overview":"Dooly Bravo Land is a South Korean Famicom platformer developed and released by Daou Infosys in 1992.

The beginning of the game brings the introduction of Resident Evil 1, originally a video, adapted to sprites. On the title screen, it's possible to start a new game and load a save game from four available slots for saving.\n\nSimilar to most Waixing games, the sounds of the game can get annoying and doesn't have any tracks from the Resident Evil series. The menu can be accessed by pressing Start and it is perfectly functional. After obtaining the map, a \"map\" button will become available on the menu.\n\nTo save the game, you need to grab the ink ribbon and go to the typewriter.

Most of the weapons from that game are present, but function differently. The default gun is similar to the original, but sometimes pressing the fire button doesn't shoot a bullet when it's supposed to due to unresponsive controls. The machine gun fires slower and and doesn't allow you to fire while jumping.

A spell can be Black or White, and in addition can be Red or Time. Black spells are offensive, White defensive; Red spells are direct, Time indirect. Thus a spell like CURE would be White Red, while LOCK would be Black Time.\n\nSome of the maps are largely the same but there are a few differences. However, many maps are completely new altogether.\n\nMany bug-fixes and improvements have been applied; too many to list, but among them are the martial arts bug, the house bug, faster text boxes, 5-letter character names, unbroken spell routines (e.g. “attack up”), and weapon elements.\n\nVersion 2 fixes most, if not all, of the graphical oddities present in version 1. It also adds a few more features, including a random(ish) default party, both directional buttons working on the character selection screen (so if you “missed” the job you wanted you don’t have to cycle back around through 11 jobs), the clinics are free now and heal everything (not just KO), as well as a variety of other miscellaneous minor fixes and improvements.\n\nAlso of note, even in version 1, there is\/was no waterfall dungeon, and it is not required to complete the game.","ReleaseDate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack"},"144955":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (UBI Soft)"},{"AlternateName":"Indiana Jones y la Última Cruzada","Region":"Spain"},{"AlternateName":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NMS Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"0a00f123-7c29-428c-8ab1-97ef8981fdf3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"099dc2f3-5676-43f6-89b8-c0b7834e3947.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0e2dc34c-ba29-492b-b67b-419a04705287.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f1b0aba3-34d8-43e4-9dc5-c32a8659837e.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"91f15f89-ca7b-44a9-b8de-21f5eb2dbcc4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f1432b8-106d-4cd6-9391-774c5432b755.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"476a04cb-d5e8-42fa-9a9c-b719f58ce9d2.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"dbbc4c54-67f1-43a8-a999-19987491349f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bbf6e6bc-36ca-47da-8e82-71edd253926d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"20d33c43-86d7-492e-8ded-a2cb95f6d907.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b31a8b40-8990-400a-87f4-b748d77f0763.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game","Overview":"The search for the Holy Grail is on!

Instead of other bootleg versions of the game, it has the whole roster from the original game along with a clone for each character (the clones having different names, changed portraits and different palettes). Some of these characters have different commands for the special moves compared to the original game. (EX: Dhalsim's spinning attacks are done by doing a back-forward motion on the ground and not holding down in the air). The game includes all the stage music from Yoko's original Street Fighter II port, being used several times for other characters.

Some might scoff at the use of a palette like this, but making the graphics look this detailed on the NES with a small set of colors is no small feat.\n\nBesides the graphical changes, the level layouts are also changed, and in some spots it’s a lot more difficult, and in others it’s easier. One thing to watch out for, though, is a distinct lack of hearts, which makes bosses a lot harder to defeat since you will only get off a few shots with your weapons before having to resort to your whip. Oh, and also be on the look-out for camouflaged staircases in a few spots– if you can’t find them, you may find yourself stuck.\n\nAlso of interest is that the soundtrack has been rearranged slightly, and in some spots modified–but the sound hacks still need a little work. Perhaps in a future version.","Publisher":"Romhacking.net","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","ReleaseYear":2002,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TBozF66qiVQ"},"157578":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Adventure Island 3: The Lost Isles","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Aether Knight","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d3514e68-2949-4a7a-9132-2ac63a5f9f62.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92486d8a-d9e5-495e-b851-66eeea0b7f18.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Adventure Island 3: The Lost Isles","Overview":"This hack was started back in December 2007.

It adds a few features and updates the official rosters for the athletes, but is functionally identical to the original Family Stadium. This specific type of annualization would become common practice for sports game franchises such as Madden NFL and NHL.\n\nIt's worth noting that this game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. The original R.B.I. Baseball and Family Stadium were one and the same, the former receiving a name change to appeal to a Western audience, but after that initial game both franchises diverged. R.B.I.

In addition to several generic Famiclones that are not worth mentioning, Subor made whole computer packages comprised of disk drives, keyboards and the works. One of Subor’s machines was emulator-based and contained a built-in SD Drive, which allowed gamers to load roms from their memory cards directly into the machine. Few are aware, however, that Subor also had exclusive software designed for use with its large array of pseudo-computer Famiclones. That is what I want to discuss today.\n\nOne of the most popular themes in educational software has to do with the learning of foreign languages. Just as Americans can purchase dozens of budget PC titles promising to teach the buyers how to speak French or Spanish, English software was the rage during the 80s and 90s. In Japan, Nintendo released a Popeye English game, and Sachen’s Middle School English was another English-based game. Subor would also follow suit, and one of their products was English Word Blaster.","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1994,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Clvciq3TP90"},"165822":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Tunnel War","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fuzhou Waixing Computer Science & Technology","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"519d37b7-8623-46bb-a0b8-980c4cd80530.jpg","Region":"China","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"71554def-e155-435e-a7bf-64bc83bf7938.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"89ed6100-e299-4526-9ea8-6328965fa2bf.png","Region":"China","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f64e4a55-aabe-4720-b566-60e575b821f9.png","Region":"China","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"90405303-3f69-4813-a60b-5c9341570205.jpg","Region":"China","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Di Dao Zhan","Overview":"This game is based on the 1965 film of the same name, about a small town which defends itself from the Japanese by use of a network of tunnels during the Second Sino-Japanese War.","Publisher":"Fuzhou Waixing Computer Science & Technology","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1996,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pZ4kwtWeoJk"},"165960":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Super Fighter III","Region":"Asia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"J.Y.

Everyone has most of their moves, with the exceptions of Guile's other basic attacks, Dhalsim's Yoga Flame, and Vega's Wall Climb. The stages have all been ported over, except Chun-Li's, who now uses a totally original stage for unknown reasons. Some moves are performed differently as well: Ryu\/Ken's Shoryuken and Sagat's Tiger Uppercut require the player to hold Forward, tap Down while still holding Forward, and then press A. Dhalsim's air attacks are preformed by pressing A or B during the height of his jump. Also, any of the charge attacks (ones that require the player to hold down or back) will lose their \"charge\" if holding Down-Forwards or Down-Backwards. All of the music in the game is entirely original.\n\nThis game has managed to keep the gameplay close to the original although notably, it doesn't retain any combos. Unlike many pirates which either stay with 3 colors or only color in certain tiles, the way the sprites are done is that tiles are placed on top of one another similar to how the sprites in the Mega Man games are done. As the NES only has two buttons, strong\/weak attacks are determined by how long the buttons are pressed. The opponents go in a preset order, instead of having the non-boss fighters be chosen at random.","Publisher":"Supervision Entertainment Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lo2ubnjDmqU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Street_Fighter_III"},"165965":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"spiiin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6ecd4fa5-648e-4445-9e44-b56d357109d5.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d89d869e-40bf-4105-b95e-1b83a48b8818.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1e393d8e-bc7e-4976-ba51-8987dc828b9e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5ddee5d5-2dd9-4391-aa21-988ba652beec.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Darkwing Duck: The New Levels","Overview":"Darkwing Duck New Levels.\n\ncreated in CadEditor http:\/\/romhacking.net.\/utilities\/967\/\n\n    New levels.\n    New arena for the boss fights\n    New bonus at every level.\n    More powerful Heavy and Thunder Gases\n    Six levels are open at start\n    Some graphics redrawn.\n    New Title screen.\n\nOriginal ROM file name : Darkwing Duck (U) [!].nes, but patch must working at most versions of game.","ReleaseDate":"2013-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack"},"165967":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Darkdata","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"5a98c7f3-05b8-43cc-a656-84bdab9d1372.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dbb26af8-ed2d-4915-9cbd-2f5d40084f4f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4d4b7a70-1e12-4b56-9421-67c6a6d55b7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"29e68a40-ab99-4c25-b2fe-0b77594447ac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"387a9984-955c-42fb-8ef3-bd6c356d1c78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7ee736b7-f20f-45a1-aa68-55dc31ef0fb2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Toads Christmas Adventure","Overview":"Santa’s evil brother has stolen Toad’s little sister (Toadette) and toad’s gift!

The Base levels now take up the whole screen in size and the targets have been changed, although strangely the enemies still spawn in the same spots that they did in the original. Some targets are also invisible here for unknown reasons. The gun targets here also fire more often than they did originally. The player is now given 5 lives instead of 3 and whenever they lose a life, they keep the gun that they had when they died. The audiovisuals are the same, apart from the title screen which doesn’t have the Contra logo or Konami copyright. The Base levels also look considerably different, despite using the same tiles.

In fact, with the exception of the names of the 8 robot masters, very little is left from the original game.\n\nMega Man 4 Voyage strives to be one of the most extensive Mega Man ROM hacks to be 100% completed and released to date, with an original storyline, new places to explore, reprogrammed robot master AIs, an improved weapon arsenal, new fortress bosses and an enormous soundtrack with almost 40 original songs to accompany it all. At the same time, it still tries to stick to the “run, jump and shoot” formula of the original classic Mega Man games. The hack should be suitable for veterans and casual players alike; it is more difficult than the original Mega Man 4, but easier than most other ROM hacks and fan games out there.\n\nWhat started as a one-man project has resulted in a fine collaboration between DurfarC (main author, level design, programming, music), MartsINY (main boss designer, programming) and chiptune composers Golden Shades, RRThiel, Cosmic Gem and MarkTherence. Furthermore, the hack incorporates patches, programming assets and graphics from a wide range of people.\n\nPlease check out the README file for more information about the hack, including more detailed credits.

While the very early parts still have some resemblance to the original game, the majority of the content and the gameplay mechanics, as well as the story with its multiple stages and cut-scenes, is entirely new and very different.\n\nLala is a magic apprentice in the province of Badajoz where she lives with her teacher. She is a little bored and when her teacher is away for a few days, she decides to try an enter the Sky Palace. It is a dangerous place her teacher has warned her about, but she wants to try to enter it and collect the three power gems that are hidden there. First Lala needs to locate her teacher's magic wand. This is done in the first stage which is the closest to the original game. Lala can move around freely, but has no means to attack. She has to complete platforming sections and avoid enemies to collect eight potions to become stronger and locate a key that opens the teacher's locked dungeon. Horizontally the screen scrolls but vertically the game uses the fixed-screen flip system of the original game to connect rooms. She starts with three lives and a single collision with an enemy or a hazard such as spikes removes one. Every now and then she can find a heart-shaped lollipop that restores a life.","Publisher":"The Mojon Twins","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2016,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hgo_WiotUCg"},"171419":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Cowlitz Gamers' Adventure"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"M-Tee","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"575d9898-707e-492d-a3c9-d2746662a6e1.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"937dd515-5407-403b-90da-5152b98cb0ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9ad65b49-716e-4f3f-a7e5-1eece7ad9865.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Cowlitz Gamers Adventure","Overview":"As you may know, the new year's festival is coming soon and all the children on my island have their fireworks ready...

The Mario Bros. can use several platforms (some of them collapse when Mario or Luigi lands on them), stairs in the level, as well as Jumping Boards. There are also Warp Pipes along the way, some of which Mario can enter to visit various secret coin rooms before returning to the level, a bit further ahead than when he left. At the end of each level, a castle stands with a flagpole nearby. When Mario reaches the flagpole, he takes down the enemy flag and enters the castle, completing the level. The higher the spot that Mario hits the flagpole, the more points he receives.","ReleaseDate":"1986-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HqU_SuCA5dc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Mario_Bros.:_The_Lost_Levels"},"174948":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"快打傳説","Region":"Asia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hummer Team","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"2194eeb6-428d-499a-9df5-328ef11f4e08.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d91a46c9-3e25-499f-ab7f-2e30e6e5484b.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0fbe984f-1f2d-4e58-b122-2d1ebe723a53.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"89dd9b08-f05d-44e5-b6bc-89bf29648693.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Street Fighter IV","Overview":"A Chinese unlicensed fighting game for the Famicom. \n\nThe time has come for you to flex those biceps and stand strong against the onslaught from the competition.\n\nHave you got what it takes to become the ultimate World Warrior?","Publisher":"Gouder","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1993,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WcpnJIeZU6A","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/bootleggames.fandom.com\/wiki\/Street_Fighter_IV"},"174949":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Trax","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4e048de8-5e52-49ca-ae6a-5483745e7cd3.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"514637e1-a9c8-49b6-a324-9e6ed66f7b8f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c1581168-4730-41b9-a259-13ad20209614.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e0e62df-19e2-4f83-b929-1eee46b23e54.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"633dc1fb-9db1-45c7-868e-16b93f173dd4.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Contra: Revenge of the Red Falcon","Overview":"Revenge of the Red Falcon is a hack of Contra on the NES.

Do you like the pegboard game? Do you like !CLIK!? What if they were also two-player competitive on the NES? Well then this game's for you! Compete against a friend, or play witchoself (get those tissues, though)! There are 3 different 2-player games, along with a bonus 2-player game that you can unlock after beating all the games as 1-player. If you look around, you might also find ANOTHER 2-player only game that is hidden within!\n\nThe entire reason I started programming this game was to try and kind of vindicate myself in some way. I had already done some other games that were bigger in scope than the games of Tic-Tac XO, Pegs and !CLIK!, but didn't like how I had coded them due to being newer using 6502 at the time. All you have to do is look at the sources for those games to understand what I'm talking about! So, I went about putting the basic elements of those games into one cart, but just more standard (for instance, just regular Tic-Tac-Toe), and for 1 or 2 players. With that said, there is some sort of glitching that happens to the PPU during Tic-Tac-Toe that I could never track down, but ah well. It was a neat project.\n\nSnail Trail, one of the bonus games, was an idea for a parody of the Tron cycles game. Originally I was going to have the snails move UUUUU-BER slow. I think it turned out better having them move at the speed they are, though.","Publisher":"Sly Dog Studios","ReleaseDate":"2016-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/slydogstudios.org\/#"},"175027":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Multicart Mojon Twins","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mojon Twins","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7f3ec243-ad59-4ab9-9737-1c52b3018950.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efbae853-26f0-4968-b65e-d947955862f8.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9c42b16d-201e-43c3-897f-49b1043dcaaa.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cb5906b0-7f72-4c61-97d0-1d438d2fe7f4.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8fefb81a-6168-40d2-b5cb-4243b132ac07.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"31 in 1 REAL GAME!","Overview":"Let’s go back to the early 90s.

At round 33, the final stage, the player will take on the game's boss, \"Doh\". Once a player reaches round 33, he must defeat Doh with his remaining number of vauses in reserve; if not: game over.

You decide to go out on a quest to collect all of the black box series of games for the NES. In this RPG style adventure that takes place in a more modern setting, you must collect NES games and play them as minigames to earn power-ups and upgrades to complete the game. Can you track them all down in this epic 10+ hour quest, and who is this mysterious Evil Overlord? And what's up with this Chad guy?\n\nThe 1k Series being one of my fortes, those really aided me in being able to come up with all the minigames that I wanted to include here. Some have similarities to each other, but are still different enough to present their own unique challenges. Also, since the subject matter was specifically NES games and collecting, it gave me a chance to sprinkle a bit of social commentary and culture references in many different forms throughout the game, some obvious and others less so. When you have a lot of game to make, it's not so hard to do that either, as it turns out!\n\nThis is hands down the biggest game I have made to date. The design was the most crucial aspect to it, and it had to be done in many different ways as to keep the player within some kind of bounds of play, keeping them limited in where they could go in terms of battles, as well as obstructions that keep them from advancing into other areas. I really think the balance came out great, if I do say so myself!","Publisher":"Sly Dog Studios","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2017},"181040":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"1efcda83-908e-43f5-bd5a-db81191a3937.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Justice Duel","Publisher":"Mega Cat Studios","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"181043":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"0a635be1-2fa0-4fa0-9d91-8237d441f17d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Little Lancelot","Publisher":"Piko Interactive","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"181595":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"4d9129a1-bf37-402a-bb6f-bfd6b6c3c71f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6408e23e-61bf-4b07-a29b-d49cec43661e.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac75e20e-9adf-44a9-a31e-fac3959f0c15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"06aa9683-e736-4d49-9a99-bcb8b85e1e44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3f083a8a-5ccb-4d82-bbb0-d7152b82570b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tekken 3","Overview":"This is a bootleg Tekken game.

A rom hack perhaps? I say thee nay! This is a 100% home-brew remake of the SNES game using NES graphics. But that's not all! The music has been 8-bitted and the sound has been 8-bitted as well. Does this mean we've lost anything?\n \nEvidentially not! The graphics are superb and it's all there. Every stage, every item, every nut and bolt ...\n\nWait, what's that? There's no bolts in the game? And no Rush Search either? In an effort to make these games more NES-like the following things have been changed:\n\n    No intro or midway stages. In addition, all eight stages are available from the start.\n    No going back to the level select after beating a stage in Wily's Castle. In addition, if you die all your tanks are gone.\n    No bolts. Which means no shopping.\n    No Rush Search. I guess that was too NES-like?\n    Where the Rush Search adaptor was (in Freezeman's level) the Exit adaptor can be obtained.\n    Since there's no Rush Search, you get the PU fist by hitting the ledge where it's hidden in Junkman's level with the Thunder Bolt.\n    The Energy Balancer is where Auto's Hyperbolt was in Springman's level.\n    Robot Masters don't \"flinch\" when hit with their weaknesses (meaning they are not pushed back and their attack cycle does not start over).\n    Fliptop appears in some levels as his NES incarnation did.\n    Beat is NES-ized ... naturally he doesn't work on Wily nor any Robot Master.\n\nThese changes are somewhat controversial.

It was part of the Star Wars space-based weapons initiative. It consisted of an unknown large number of satellites orbiting Earth. Each satellite was essentially a space cannon, able to shoot large projectiles at targets on the planet. Although officially discontinued in 1993, Brilliant Pebbles remained secretly operational.\n\nIn the year 199X, Earth was threatened by a large wave of asteroids and comets. The commanders decided to use the Brilliant Pebbles defense platform to defend the planet. The military converted the satellites into unmanned space drones. The drones were controllable from command centers on the ground.\n\nThe waves of space rocks were relentless...almost endless. They required military-space action over most of the planet's outer reaches. Each soldier was granted control over a small set of drones. If one drone was obliterated, the soldier could commandeer another. After destroying enough rocks, the soldier could earn another ship.

This version also came packaged with some games already included. Games are accessed by typing GAME followed by a space then a number (0, 1, 2, or 3).\n\nThe following are the games that were included:\n\nGAME 0 is the Heart Game. Using either a microphone or the keyboard, players get to fill in a heart with Mario and Pauline (of Donkey Kong fame) meeting in the middle for a smooch.\n\nGAME 1 is the Number Game. Players control a penguin on a grid collecting numbers in sequential order while trying to avoid the Sidesteppers from Mario Bros..\n\nGAME 2 is the Mario Game.

Most of the music backgrounds are repurposed from the Mortal Kombat V bootleg , and the title screen music is a remixed version of its similar from the fighter selection screen from the original Mortal Kombat arcade (1992, Midway ).\n\nAvailable characters include Sindel , Liu Kang , Kano , Sonya , Nightwolf , Kung Lao (as Kung-Lao ), Stryker , Sub-Zero, and Shang Tsung (as Shang ). Unlike other Mortal Kombat- based bootlegs , this one in particular features graphic blood effects and a single Fatality for all characters: an uppercut that explodes the character. You may notice a typo in the pre- Fatality announcement. The text \" Finish Him! \" ( Suggested translation: \" Finish it! \" ), Which in English refers to the masculine gender, appears when Sindel is defeated; on the contrary, when Sonya is defeated, the correct text \" Finish Her! \" ( suggested translation: \" Finish her! \" ) appears, which in English refers to the female gender.\n\nThe scenarios that appear in Mortal Kombat 5 are The Rooftop , The Temple , Graveyard and Soul Chamber , which sometimes appear with the color palette changed when you face a different character. The end of the game is a screen of congratulations and thanks for playing.","Publisher":"Cony Soft","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","ReleaseYear":1998,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Xj-vW4ZvYA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2IUrgAA"},"196484":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NTDEC","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Shooter; Sports; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"e97f6fb6-6e92-4cc9-a843-444a8b314368.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f6c02f77-613d-4973-9836-708e12023fa9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Caltron: 9 in 1","Overview":"9 in 1 is an unlicensed multicart based on Caltron 6 in 1.

It's entirely different from the port that was released on the NES in Europe and the United States in 1990 and is a unique game.\n\nManiac Mansion is a graphic adventure video game. It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend Sandy Pantz from a mad scientist, whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a point-and-click interface to guide Dave and two of his six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is non-linear, and the game must be completed in different ways based on the player's choice of characters. \n\nThe game was conceived in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, who sought to tell a comedic story based on horror film and B-movie clichés. They mapped out the project as a paper-and-pencil game before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on command lines, Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed Maniac Mansion's simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a game engine called SCUMM, which was used in many later LucasArts titles. After its release, Maniac Mansion was ported to several platforms.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1988-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maniac_Mansion"},"197606":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Floofy sheepie","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"4f52748d-df24-414b-8e4e-f21ef69abdc4.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"20a36ba2-409d-4529-8cab-bee1cde83f39.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Super floofy sheepie","Overview":"Super Floofy Sheepie is a game written entirely in assembly language, for the NES.
