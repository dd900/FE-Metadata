The 19 gods of Olympus left behind an omnipotent stone to the great emperor Achilles, who has ordered a search to be conducted for the stone. You take the role of one of these four in an effort to find the stone on the island before the rest, waging war with opponent armies to prevent them from finding it first.\n\n19 is somewhat unique among turn based strategy games, in that turns are taken in real time, following rules that are reminiscent of the Japanese chess-like game known as Shogi. The game takes place on an overworld map, on which players take turns moving troops. When opposing troops vi for the same location, the game switches to a zoomed-in combat screen, showing each individual member of the opposing forces. While the story of the game revolves around finding a stone, there is no actual stone to discover. Your only goal is to wipe out the armies of the other three opponents.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJHINroWDUE","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Soft Pro International","Publisher":"Soft Pro International","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"36321488-0076-4668-b853-05431011a04b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"158ff317-6667-4feb-a636-07e06b3ca2eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"148d6e91-72c6-40d3-be9a-53b1a1093321.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"1e80e878-e583-4431-a653-baba1c6d4a01.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"f02ec14b-c5fc-49d3-9a26-143ad7e58608.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"dd737c93-00e4-48c3-9c1e-4ffe33919a44.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"2ee5c4f8-ffe1-4c64-9bd9-34c8256dde67.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"60af7060-1cab-4028-9920-198a910115bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":102455,"FileName":"a78a3796-726d-4cca-8dfd-a36a1041fbad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":102455,"AlternateName":"Neunzehn","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":102455,"AlternateName":"Neunzehn: 19","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":90301,"Name":"Adian No Tsue","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Adian No Tsue is not a traditional adventure game - It is most and foremost an educational game designed to appeal to a young audience. It is also the first installment of a series of games released in Japan by SunSoft. The player takes control of a courageous knight and the game follows a traditional overhead display which somehow bears some resemblance to Nintendo's Zelda. Each room is usually filled up with monsters and four doors lead to other surrounding rooms, different locations or just hide special items. However, the only way for our hero to pass these doors is to solve simple arithmetic equations. Numbers from 0 to 9 appear on two sides of the room and the knight must run around the room and touch them to display the right answer. Yet, these expressions are very simple and only use simple additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions. Nonetheless, solving them while running around the rooms and hitting crazy skeletons with a sword can be a challenging task. The other side of the disk contains a simple marathon game also based on arithmetic challenges.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObahVqBE6R0","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"ASK Kodansha","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"aacf5481-25b5-4fff-b248-fc92e9bfc9b9.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"704eed85-59ec-4732-9af9-b2db3151ffb7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"06363888-1668-4e90-971c-5866d41e245c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"ff7297a1-dcff-4a06-8754-240a31918bac.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"288f26a1-c8e9-42a7-8c0f-42695f6f5774.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"5bcf4ace-170a-46e9-8551-540fac72cba0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"eb0b4a94-6b2f-426b-ae24-524a1fbc40c1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"ffc1cb2f-d790-4e17-a3eb-63e0b24ccf5e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"33ac120f-9a92-48ad-a336-50259024cd01.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"45d26d30-dcd8-4504-8dec-2f2b511ec514.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"58272267-d773-434d-9552-baf407f8904b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"f19a8c67-aeec-4e19-8c0b-2db4bfac5804.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90301,"FileName":"38c76608-9cb2-49ad-ac28-de415d3dd8b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90327,"Name":"Ai Senshi Nicol","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ai Senshi Nicol is a top down, action shooter.

The prologue begins when Simon visits his family's resting ground. His back is critically injured from his last encounter with Dracula in the previous game. He suddenly feels someone's presence, and turns to see a young woman standing within the mist. She tells him that a curse was placed upon him by Dracula during their last battle, and that he does not have long to live. The woman continues to say that the curse can be undone if he resurrects Dracula himself. She further explains that Dracula's body was split into five different parts after his defeat seven years ago, and Simon must recover these and bring them to the ruins of Dracula's castle. There, he must seal Dracula and defeat him. Before disappearing, the unknown woman says she cannot guarantee that this will destroy Dracula permanently.\n\nDracula II - Noroi no Fuuin (Lit. \"Dracula II: The Seal of the Curse\") is an action-adventure game produced by Konami. It was originally released for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan in 1987, and for the NES in North America in 1988. It is the second Castlevania title released for the NES, following the original Castlevania. Set in 1698, seven years after the events of the first installment, the player once again assumes the role of vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is on a journey to undo a curse placed on him by Dracula at the end of their previous encounter. Small differences exist between the Japanese version and the American version. Specifically the Japanese version takes advantage of the expanded FM processing capabilities of the FDS hardware to produce better sound, but it contains load scenes when entering or exiting any town or mansion. The FDS version also has three save slots instead of the NES password system.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZrqoLqBpx0","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"236301c0-8116-4e54-b588-c0ad832e26b3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"1c0291c5-cd2c-409c-ad9b-8adfe1c4a944.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"165d9691-4653-42bb-9fe2-6a8bc46d9b0f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"0c715053-7553-426e-8dcc-4b7919bf82a1.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"d411bb00-798f-4e1f-b80f-68be2910f350.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"a882a353-96cc-4763-8293-a34244c07307.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"03c16ed4-2cbb-4e96-968e-34cf60593a88.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"5a252b72-3b9e-43ba-950a-c1ea137344c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102450,"FileName":"b751da46-ce6a-442f-994a-a497c82fc6bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":102450,"AlternateName":"Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":99936,"Name":"Akuu Senki Raijin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Akuu Senki Raijin is a vertical shooter where the player controls a mecha that transforms into a starfighter.

It stars a randomly named little girl who lives in a 3 story house with her cat. Very little interaction is featured in the game. Gameplay largely involves simply watching the girl go about their daily life. She wanders the house, occasionally doing activities like exercising, reading, brushing her teeth, feeding herself, sleeping, or even playing a game on her Famicom. The time of day is tracked on an in-game clock, on which 5 minutes is only a few seconds in real time.\n\nSimple requests can be selected from the menu bar. These include making the phone ring, sending the girl a letter, sending her to purchase food or milk, feeding the cat, sending her a Famicom game as a gift, and having her perform a song on the piano. The girl only stores a few boxes of food and bottles of milk, and must be sent out to retrieve more before she runs out. If left neglected for too long, the girl will become angry, and may leave the house and never return.\n\nOne option in the menu allows the player to have their fortune told by the girl. This can be done through a blood-type compatibility test, a horoscope, or a variation of tarot using playing cards.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR8v7juMceQ","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Square","Publisher":"Disk Original Group","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"39f08b02-af26-45c6-a341-81435ba22d5b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"a328be50-b008-4b51-a318-b380b9153c9a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"115ed047-a487-45e4-9f99-0e23be74a5a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"4dca5063-a6b7-40fa-b4b6-a9188b487e42.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"a2e97f20-0f86-4ccc-afff-61a43874b01d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"ebb6558d-bc52-45c9-9348-163bbe194445.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"4fefc1e6-4ae3-471b-96c5-b18b846994a5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"5b9a5e2b-3d46-47db-aba9-c7a1569c6268.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"be95a1bd-1b2e-470d-a516-dcbc5823ffd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90329,"FileName":"1fd384c6-1910-47e7-bd8f-c654ddcb39cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":90329,"AlternateName":"Apple Town Story: Little Computer People","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":90328,"Name":"Arumana no Kiseki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Arumana, a legendary red jewel, has been stolen, and the villagers have all turned to stone.

The protagonist must advance through six stages using his wits, his weapons, and his trusty grappling hook. The grappling hook is extremely indispensable as it is used to climb upwards to out-of-reach ledges. This skill is used frequently as it is required to advance through the often vertically oriented stages. Kaito begins with nothing more than a set of throwing knives, but along the way he can find bombs, pistols, bolas, screen clearing crystals, and mines.

And so, in order to save his kingdom, Upa crawls into action...\n\nIn this game, you control a little baby. The baby crawls through imaginary worlds, made of candy, chocolate, toys, and other things a baby would dream of. It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMPi3THogsY","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"5ea03888-681e-4dad-9323-81e1f08e63a3.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"b8660d50-2fca-4592-933a-a6d8bd939754.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"a54b1901-dc6b-4f72-a4d9-bffc5444b4b8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"e9793a00-eb1b-4123-b5bc-bc63ab6b39dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"a8c6cc69-d0da-403e-90e5-5ee9f68c5100.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"f80fa3cc-8f44-41fc-a0c2-4c5833862e43.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"1a0847ac-5d8b-4ba5-805a-ae1778396d7a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"1b78b8b1-5af4-4f8d-b3aa-5e0b265cb81f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"eaf13967-b289-4b1f-bae7-38891dffbe3e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"3fe7b1d3-e07c-49f3-957b-2f159553d959.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90337,"FileName":"86add69f-2be7-482e-b747-afbb1c6894fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90333,"Name":"Bishoujo Control","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Combining the gameplay of an arcade shoot'em'up with watching pretty girls, Bishoujo Control puts you in a spaceship, battling hordes of enemies flying downwards. All that flies is not an enemy, though; you can also shoot at blocks that, when shot, make up a picture of a pretty girl on the right of the screen. Picking up bonuses in the shape of the signs for \"pretty girl\" powers up your weapon. When all pieces of the picture are picked up, you are given a chance to enjoy the picture at your own pace before progressing to the next level (and the next girl).\n\nThe gameplay can be spiced up by upgrading your spaceship into a much more \"phallic\" configuration, with bullets looking like big sperm, while the enemies come in the shape of scissors, mouths, pants and syringes. Your ship can also gain a condom shield. Whereas the MSX version starts off like a more normal shooter, progressively becoming more vulgar, this is the default mode in the Famicom version.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0su2azCWtc","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Hacker International","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90333,"FileName":"e6835113-51b9-4f8c-aae5-20e919d764d8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90333,"FileName":"c4d0b531-12ab-4c31-855a-3b412d112c7d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90333,"FileName":"f47a12e0-bb4e-462c-af20-f64179c7e5af.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90333,"FileName":"9bc07838-3eb5-49b1-903d-45b58c997e05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90333,"FileName":"13619ce4-1903-4872-ba63-47b7ae7f942b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90515,"Name":"Bishoujo Hanafuda Club Vol 1: Oityokabu Hen","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"An adult Famicom Disk System Game released by Super Pig/Hacker International.

One day, he learned of a rumor that stated if a robot could ever escape the labyrinth and reach the surface of the world, his wish would be granted and he would become human. Bomberman is determined to find out if this rumor is true.\n\nBased on an earlier MSX game of the same name, Hudson Soft dramatically improved the game for its Famicom release by adding a number of enemies, horizontally scrolling stages, and the power-ups that make keeping Bomberman alive so worthwhile. But they also made the first steps in shaping the Bomberman character that we know and recognize today. The sprite used for Bomberman actually came from an enemy sprite used in Hudson Soft's very successful Famicom conversion of Lode Runner. One of the robotic enemies that chased the Lode Runner hero learned that he might become human if he can climb fifty underground floors to escape from his plant and reach the surface of the world. The only weapon at Bomberman's disposal, of course, are bombs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svpsSoFoPY","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"cceb0826-1df0-4c74-a12a-38b7a4bcd4cb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"b07ece56-560c-4175-b71c-f1025aedcca0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"5f39616d-a13a-4e12-944e-79ea322d68d3.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"06886a7c-600f-4901-b70d-2c6733fd3e30.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"17d7b7d2-99c5-4d72-b60c-59b3d5b41805.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"0d580b90-32b9-4f88-b078-e21e8db71a82.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"fc255ae0-a9ea-454b-9abc-c3495197a92b.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"852af84b-5890-44f7-8405-994aeefe0698.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103537,"FileName":"32d79053-d145-427b-a56b-df9fb2655548.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91183,"Name":"Breeder","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Breeder is a sort of fighting game featuring automated fighting robots designed by the player.

Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points.

All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.

If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the game level is finished.\n\nWhile making burgers, the player must avoid the antagonists, three types of enemies: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, stunned, crushed with a falling ingredient, or dropped by luring them onto an ingredient and then causing it to fall. In this last case, the piece will fall two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Enemies that have been crushed or dropped return to the maze after a few seconds. Dropped enemies award larger point values than crushed ones; therefore, to obtain a high score, the player must attract more than one enemy onto an ingredient just before dropping it.\n\nPeter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.\n\nThere are six screens of increasing difficulty, with more burgers and enemies, burgers that have more parts, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach the ingredients. Completing all six screens takes the player back to the first one.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Data East","Publisher":"Data East","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"3c0b334b-9f3c-467f-809f-0640611afa05.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"a03f0036-7c1d-4ea9-bd55-ae1a4993119c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"b2ce2b62-92d8-43ff-a684-fde69ecc29fa.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"1fb96ffe-e4e1-4be4-ab71-1b258a8b5472.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"59f798a8-ac5d-44de-bdd0-7a916adcbdbe.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"4f1c1ddc-af7e-467e-a8e6-b35229b1ed9b.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"873ba027-a334-41c1-826b-4cfc7df01997.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103509,"FileName":"e80072ec-4d6a-4479-88af-d38a98a3126c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131863,"Name":"Casino de Pink","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Unlicensed blackjack game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Wild Turtle","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"c13dd2af-b4fe-4266-9c1d-598ed0267177.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"77b3e8d1-ff2e-4814-893c-b62feb7ee4dd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"a2ac6242-2508-441f-8703-0e2aa088bf35.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"9ad15e21-989a-44c9-a1d6-26e973487694.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"7b148fd7-bc89-4e85-b496-59f2f1a83c50.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"8081d124-44c1-4f84-9c96-aa7e9caf66fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131863,"FileName":"915c8d29-21bf-4dca-9542-0cba562dd989.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90534,"Name":"Chitei Tairiku Ordola","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Chitei Tairiku Ordola (\"Underground Continent Ordola\") is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game's model (in Ordola's case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it.

Battles are turn-based, with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and \"level up\" after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.\n\nThe player character, Daisuke Kusano, is the son of an archaeologist who disappeared while searching for the Tears of Isis, artifacts once owned by Cleopatra. During the man's excavation for the Tears, demons appeared and abducted him. The boy soon learns that he must find the Tears in order to save his father. Over the course of the adventure, Daisuke visits the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Temple of Kom Ombo, a tower of sand, and an underground labyrinth. At the end of the game, he discovers that the demons had been disguised as the kindly shopkeeper. Daisuke receives the last Tear of Isis upon defeating the demons, which summons the ghost of Cleopatra, who releases Daisuke's father from imprisonment.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlXibpsUO8A","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Square","Publisher":"Disk Original Group","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"de95e32b-3751-4823-8463-74f8b062d3c8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"4c7d0b01-6bde-415d-8253-20ba404ca65c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"26513d05-2f5d-4b83-a27c-18bcfbcd9932.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"01dfc595-44b3-4ecd-8b0f-d6b54aec9b15.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"e6f6d57f-97b2-4d74-a050-ccdfed8c7e81.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"55de69f8-deef-4746-84e3-42c54d3b0fdf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"11ce1acb-127a-405b-a982-21f9a712b4f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"a7a05310-49ff-41e3-876e-46d06a56f5f2.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"439168ba-094e-488c-8011-b845ccfed434.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"FileName":"7e3da3b7-1dc8-4102-9603-40b462b7c510.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":100693,"AlternateName":"Cursed Treasure of Cleopatra, The","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":100693,"AlternateName":"Cleopatra no Mahō","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":101266,"Name":"Clu Clu Land: Welcome to New Cluclu Land","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Clu Clu Land, the player is an female balloonfish named Bubbles who swims around in a maze trying to uncover all the golden Ingots.\n\nClu Clu Land's story starts with a type of sea urchin, the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, Bubbles can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost when Bubbles falls into a Black Hole, or when time runs out. The game ends if Bubbles has lost all her lives.\n\nIn later levels, the player must pass over the ingots an odd number of times to uncover them, as they will alternate between their uncovered side and a dull side.\n\nThe Famicom Disk version is based on Vs. Clu Clu Land which was released for the coin-op Nintendo Vs. System. It contained twice as many puzzles, a new enemy (Boss Unira), different level themes, and some other adjusted game features.\n\nThis is the last licensed game that was released for the Famicom Disk System. Because of this it is arguably the rarest Famicom Disk system game and sells for a large amount of money.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1992-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"5b247c53-9689-4a9a-9d35-bd584e34fe40.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"51458f8d-047a-4309-8b86-7ba8625d2f65.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"b73e5e09-8732-413b-8a6b-57c9793b7a99.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"c75f2726-9e63-46d4-98e2-a6c789446d00.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"54191d23-5191-40ff-8b0e-e2f0868f64df.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"9ca2d8e1-d3be-4967-bc74-75dc3f763ad3.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"5b86efbf-158e-461d-a1de-0b0c3deba098.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"b537827f-4dbc-44be-8524-624e602acb8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101266,"FileName":"81960275-c09b-4447-869a-19d40a153ffb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":101266,"AlternateName":"Clu Clu Land D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":101266,"AlternateName":"Clu Clu Land: Welcome to New Clu Clu Land","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":90369,"Name":"Cocona World","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Cocona World is a storybook-styled fantasy adventure game that is superficially similar to The Legend of Zelda and the other top-down action-adventure games that were inspired by it.

It was made by Waixing Computer Science & Technology. The game itself at first seems to be a regular turn based RPG. However, there are some notable differences. For one, there are no \"inns\" or anything similar in this game. Instead the characters regain health and magic after each fight automatically, to a certain extent. This is not a problem later on but becomes one towards the one of the game.\n\nAnother difference is that there is little to do in the game other then talking to people and fighting enemies. Despite not knowing Chinese one can force one's way through the game by simply fighting the boss characters visible on the screen and talking to people. There is little chance of not knowing where to go as you can only go into areas that you have to go to next. Otherwise the game simply notes the area as being somewhere you can go by displaying a name, but will not allow you to go inside, even if there is seemingly nothing preventing your entry. In addition, NPCs and defeated boss characters will not repeat dialogue that they've already said, so one can check quite easily if he missed a necessary conversation by simply attempting to talk to them again. There is little need to really know what they say in depth as the conversation usually amounts to an event flag which opens up a previously inaccessible area. \n\nOne notable thing about the game is that it is set on one map, which is however divided into three areas. Once the player gets teleported to the other side of the river, there is no way to go back to the starting area. It is at this point where the game becomes more imbalanced. There are two boss characters here, both of whom use an attack that hurts the entire party for 200 or 300 dammage respectively. Progress having been much smoother before, one has to start going around and grind the enemies in this area, far tougher then those in the first area. It's here that the auto healing function stops being much of an asset, as there is only a certain amount of health and magic that regenerates after a fight and if you keep running into the skeletons, you will probably keep on losing energy rather then getting any back.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmnqhyarx-8","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Waixing","Publisher":"Waixing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176669,"FileName":"ce7ca997-b028-4697-99d8-687c191f3fbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176669,"FileName":"a9631055-f21d-4b51-ac64-8b96d5813720.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176669,"FileName":"9afec38c-9258-4b64-90f0-83ffe44e1e93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176669,"FileName":"796897a4-b805-428c-b7d3-958a70d6c6a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":176669,"AlternateName":"Mo Shen Fa Shi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":102447,"Name":"Dig Dug","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.

If both ends of a system of faults reach the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean, killing all creatures on it, including Taizo himself. The points earned from this depend on how many enemies are killed at once. Once three pieces of land have been cut off an island, a bonus vegetable will appear somewhere on what remains of the island, which can be eaten for extra points. After the thirty-first round, the rounds will be identical to the first sixteen rounds before it. When only one, two or (on later rounds) three enemies remain on the island, the enemies will eventually head for the edge of the island and jump into the water, killing themselves and the player points are lost.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1990-08-31T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"40073aa1-5811-43c7-a440-6217c86e97d2.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"da358247-c671-467b-b022-43139ffb3d6d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"9ad2857f-5e1a-4f29-92c1-bff5e6e78482.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"4d15e6df-5bcd-4567-952c-f875951a0de1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"a497c364-ba58-4e63-acdb-11e6ebb2b2ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"b6fb6f3c-123a-4e4d-9f31-b86d5c179678.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"5e285ae0-354d-4627-8e23-e9574d1e9949.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"85ec6893-fc0a-4ca5-8cfd-a97b851f83dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102448,"FileName":"dba89a38-ddbd-4b76-9ae2-23518d6ae392.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91185,"Name":"Dirty Pair: Project Eden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kei and Yuri, two cute space investigators, are the heroines of this side-scrolling action game by Bandai and based on the popular animation series Dirty Pair.

The players starts by taking control of the red-haired Kei. She can jump and fire using her laser-gun and the goal of the fist part of the game is to reach the enemy's lair. Once there, Yuri joins the party on a flying-bike. If Kei can make it quickly enough, she can jump on the bike and fly through the rest of the stage. However, make sure she doesn't hit a wall or any obstacles on the way or she will have to finish it on foot. Once their destination is reached, the game switches to a more static room mode where Kei infiltrates a building and move from room to room, looking for items such as floppy discs and unlock doors.

The tower format would also be the one adopted for the next three games - the Adventures of Lolo series.\n\nSouzouhe no Tabidachi was created as part of Nintendo's \"Disk Writer\" service, wherein a Nintendo Famicom Disk System owner could take a disk to a special kiosk found in video game stores and have one of a selection of games written onto it; the idea being that the player could beat the game and then have their disk rewritten with a new game for a nominal fee. Souzouhe no Tabidachi is one of the few games that could only be procured from one of these Disk Writer machines, making it a rare find for collectors.\n\nAs with the other Eggerland games, the goal is to help Prince Lolo collect every heart-shaped icon on the screen and return to a key that appears once all the hearts are collected. However, many of the enemies will only become aggressive once the last heart icon is collected and the key appears, which means some strategy is required regarding which heart icons to collect in what order as well as planning a safe route to the key. Lolo has a few tools at his disposal, such as turning enemies into eggs and using the harmless Snakey creatures as shields.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgBxqzIoMak","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseDate":"1988-08-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"491b1302-4405-456c-bae7-fb47cca7882d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"b306bd1e-7e0e-4525-9fb8-5c80f4ada1aa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"50174b25-b92c-4723-b62e-2fd5301ee534.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"595c0d49-1dfa-44b5-823d-12f7641c4ff2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"e2e27400-2c47-4bb3-a1f5-63af09f7620f.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"a47f98fb-d493-403c-8dee-21831e8c3d03.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"54858109-943d-461a-b483-74ef61a154d7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"07cad4e6-eafa-4f28-a69a-4d5c266e8c3e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"a30c0544-d10e-4f20-a193-249b395ecea2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"1b3cdcaa-32a4-4a06-9956-4bc73dd41bf7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"cc4483e8-9aa4-4a2d-a7ef-7546c2f666c1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"2c52b5b0-2dc4-487a-bca4-8fe024e7aaf4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"FileName":"71445fd2-8c2b-4d3c-952f-3c58e20b1a61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93050,"AlternateName":"Eggerland - Souzou heno Tabidachi","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93050,"AlternateName":"Eggerland: Souzou e no Tabidachi","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93050,"AlternateName":"Eggerland: Souzou Heno Tabidachi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":99941,"Name":"Electrician","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The player character is a young electrician called Richard Light.

Battles are started when the player runs into various pairs of moving footprints on the ground. This takes the player to a separate enclosed battlefield. There the player can use their weapons (or ESP powers) to defeat their enemies. Winning battles will increase the player's character's experience points, eventually leveling them up when they reach certain experience point totals. Leveling up increases their Hit Points (HP) and ESP Points (EP). The player can also buy weapons by using the Gold Pieces that defeated enemies leave behind.\n\nThe game is over when the player's HP reaches zero - or when the player has successfully saved Brick Town from the evil scourge.\n\nUp to three save slots are available.

It will be a long journey through six varied stages, from asteroid fields to narrow and deep canyons. The craft can use a simple Vulcan laser gun or secondary, and in limited supplies, homing missiles. Power-ups, in the shape of floating orbs stamped with the letter P, sometimes appear from defeated enemies. Blue ones speed-up the ship and red ones increase the depleting stock of homing missiles.

In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view similar to Outrun and Rad Racer. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.\n\nIn order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.\n\nAs the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFc2PpToqGk","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1988-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"ca27204c-9568-48aa-aa6c-f87691c5abb3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"820730a8-1def-4f4d-8739-9787cca36811.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"08700f2a-1853-4814-8d69-09b1a9eed18c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"ca304d77-90bd-44bb-a763-61ac41a36905.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"b3cc1d00-3ede-4ada-a2fc-b7c4460c6430.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"7bb87e38-cd69-4881-a66c-b03b673d3a03.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"c10b2912-5093-4f4d-9283-9c6e1db68349.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"f6e9967a-70e3-4149-ad0a-5c941fd999f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92514,"FileName":"0ad89c93-04fd-4c67-8805-04b05b56b57e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93040,"Name":"Famicom Grand Prix: F1 Race","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Compete in championships or try to beat your best time in this top-down Formula 1 racing game.\n\nFamicom Grand Prix: F1 Race gives you 10 tracks to race on with either dry or rainy conditions.

Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.\n\nPlayers can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.\n\nWhen on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.\n\nThis game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFgDqscCyMY","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"3d5399e8-eb3f-4e7c-99d1-1e9bf69a0470.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"16937f53-85b5-42e6-8b98-15176ca30f1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"c0ffcade-7949-4a30-b8e0-4cf603c0be13.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"83d23233-27ce-4c89-b943-064422b35827.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"e84b6cf0-c140-4cc8-9efe-c4514ce567b2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"a2a5cb06-e9e5-4e51-a260-edb4127ce9a3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"8e1a702c-eca2-4c95-bf8e-74ffc8b3be11.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"08e14713-c3f9-4ea7-ad40-3814d76f148a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"FileName":"a6901afe-c37b-4154-a879-765a55ed5322.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":92512,"AlternateName":"Family Computer Golf Tournament - Japan Course","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":92512,"AlternateName":"Golf: Japan Course","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":127249,"Name":"Family Computer Golf: Japan Course Prize Cart","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127249,"FileName":"95417afc-4d1a-4ca5-aff3-993537bf4f60.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127249,"FileName":"54b80129-b84e-43c3-b17d-18a0a4ef49bb.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127249,"FileName":"50ba2333-8bc9-4ae6-af78-6aeadf04d373.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127249,"FileName":"2bfa8329-ee9c-443d-a33a-5d0e2125c0f2.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127249,"FileName":"d8138fba-da76-4e5b-8a7d-676e28163ab7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127249,"FileName":"df506ec0-91c8-4380-8749-98b338053ed8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":127249,"AlternateName":"Golf: Japan Course Prize Cart","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127249,"AlternateName":"Family Computer Golf: Special Course","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":92513,"Name":"Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A companion title to the earlier Japan Course, Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course focuses on American courses.

These include a stopwatch that extends the time the player has to complete the stage, a bomb can that can eliminate one block and is occasionally necessary to beat stages and a galaxy spiral that can be placed anywhere to temporarily stop the laser.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xrep6vaQJE","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Tokuma Shoten","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"1ee7a9d2-7007-4a96-99fe-d1d4920d63bd.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"58cb5d71-d811-4f7c-b954-09ebfa5ac9bf.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"a6e540dc-61e9-4163-942a-ebcf5d2a626d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"180a2f0d-37fe-4c65-983a-89c81bfaf746.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"0cd9fd3a-9b50-42ed-a07b-e990d9697bf4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"d48e1715-b372-4020-bcf4-5fde39855662.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"4462fcb6-912e-4572-af9e-0792f4f784e3.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"a5dad564-7c0d-4c8b-a869-a94ae425baa2.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"c6b52839-f07f-4db8-8001-aa803f5c9d55.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103532,"FileName":"5cbda3ff-f4f5-42ec-a3a2-e254ffe8735b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":103533,"Name":"Famimaga Disk Vol. 3: All 1","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"All One, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 3: All One, is a puzzle game in which the player controls a ladybug pushing over dice.

Single clock faces depicting one of four angles fall from the top and the player needs to manipulate and place them so they can form larger objects, such as simple formations like squares, diamonds and hourglass shapes to more object-intensive shapes like octagons and hexagons.\n\nThe four angles include 180 degree lines (\"12:30\"), 90 degree lines (\"12:15\"), 135 degree lines (\"~12:22\") and 45 degree lines (\"~12:07\"). Once a clock face is placed, the lines from it extend to connect to any other lines that surround it. Placing lines in such a way that it forms a shape - for example, placing four 90 degree clocks in such a way to form a square - earns the player points and removes the clocks used to form the shape. Larger shapes are more risky but earn more points.\n\nThe player is given some leeway to recover from mistakes: should the player hold the down button to make a clock fall faster, it'll destroy any clocks underneath. A misplacement, therefore, can be rectified with a correctly positioned clock if it falls quickly enough to crush the offending clock.

In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the \"scissors\" gesture, the \"rock\" gesture or the \"paper\" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a \"strength\" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).\n\nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage.\n\nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King).\n\nJanken Disk Jou has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System.

Additionally, a 2-players co-operative mode was introduced as well, allowing two players to play simultaneously (with Player 1 in blue and Player 2 in red). The play mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, however the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remained) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The FDS version also features two additional stages that were not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base in which the player must disarm a nuclear missile at the end that is about to be launched; by using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit.\n\nThe FDS version features a few differences from its NES counterpart by allowing the player to continue up to three times after a game over and if the player loses a life in the Famicom version, his character will respawn at the very spot where he died instead of being sent to the last checkpoint (in the NES version, instant respawns are only allowed in the 2-Players game). Moreover, the player can carry up to nine rounds of any secondary weapon he finds instead of just three. To rebalance the difficulty, the NES version gives the player more extra lives when they begin (four instead of two) and all weapons dropped by enemies will always have three rounds in them instead of having the player accumulate them one by one. The Famicom version also features hidden underground areas which the player could access by destroying certain land mines in Stage 2, 4, and 5.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0vB0Wxd4c","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"9d987891-8c13-4ba7-a013-1f9f12c4b808.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"714f6566-9d3a-4ef6-a3f9-4240d78bfeaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"6f5c0bc5-6316-4d1b-b28d-7721c0e1bfb7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"9a08730c-1dc4-46af-a265-5a5a6350f609.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"84182b41-db31-414a-9a14-a1b673ad47ee.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"1222c3b2-81ab-49be-842b-9c20ea9e569a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"7b966ba6-2c4a-4954-b3e6-8027617e4a58.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"cf256a87-8422-4056-b1af-a2557e99c1da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100692,"FileName":"6031111b-7883-47af-83f8-d87a110f22a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":100601,"Name":"Gun.Smoke","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The objective is to free the town of Hicksville from the band of criminals known as the Wingates.

While Palutena administered the light and helped the mortals cultivate their crops, Medusa despised the mortals and used the darkness to destroy their crops and turn the mortals into stone. Enraged, Palutena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster and banished her into the dark Underworld.\n\nBut Medusa would not go quietly. She assembled an army of monsters and evil spirits of the underworld to conquer Palutena's home, the Palace in the Sky. War erupted and Medusa's minions overwhelmed Palutena's army, eventually imprisoning the Goddess of Light. Medusa then seized the Three Sacred Treasures—the Mirror Shield, the Arrow of Light, and the Wings of Pegasus—and gave them to her most powerful minions.\n\nDefeated and imprisoned, Palutena's only hope was to seek the help of Pit, a young angel trapped in the Underworld. Using the last of her strength, she sent Pit a magical bow. Thus, Pit set out on a quest to escape the Underworld, retrieve the Sacred Treasures that would help him defeat Medusa, and rescue Palutena and restore peace to Angel Land.\n\nThe original Famicom Disk System versions feature save slots, unlike the North American version which uses a password system (known in-game as \"Sacred Words\").

Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the \"game over\" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv4d6MHDcio","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Life Simulation","Developer":"Square","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"7f54c879-dba4-4623-a9dc-8e4c2d1baf1c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"4783e657-b20c-46a4-baa2-1a066c0b33cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"f591ac08-e285-40a8-8928-e688ca1f1879.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"8022afca-72c4-4cb6-8e08-ce94333a28ca.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"b5a0a805-6608-4ef6-8484-621f3cecb021.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"a5b86806-9dfc-4d3f-ae43-fde6853c4925.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"e9c36f66-204f-499e-9fbb-6efc63d2f316.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"cdc58a16-e7c5-4a0d-a300-14ea90b9b39e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93302,"FileName":"b0d7fa4a-6f90-4bb9-a52b-d3e7964c05bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93235,"Name":"Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.\n\nPrior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to \"Connect Four\" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 × 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 × 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoEO0o0jdg","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Bullet-Proof Software","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"0b6859f7-bb6e-4cec-9374-b152769b5087.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"4f05b827-40ba-4462-934b-6db222167f77.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"598f5fb2-e1fc-4550-9eb9-8262ef1fc090.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"8e1d5dbf-cde7-4103-9016-7dbae405f405.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"14c239ed-3643-4b14-a575-98791263f33a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"0c5ad442-ed69-4819-a086-0bd54b6769d9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"49f887ff-905e-4b78-babd-3fb84b523ac7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"FileName":"a5509075-8ae0-4e98-9c89-a965017e8679.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93235,"AlternateName":"Igo - Kyuroban Taikyoku","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93235,"AlternateName":"Igo: Kyuroban Taikyoku","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":99937,"Name":"Ishidou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ishido is a puzzle board game consisting of a set of 72 stones and a game board of 96 squares.\n\nEvery stone has two attributes: a color and a symbol.

(lit. Return of Mario Bros.) is an updated remake of the original NES conversion of Mario Bros, developed and published by Nintendo for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. While the original NES conversion, developed in 1983, was quite accurate to the arcade version upon which it was based, many compromises were made in order to fit the game in a limited amount of memory. These compromises included the size of the enemies, the instruction cut-scenes which introduced each enemy, and the icicles which form from the top platform later on in the game. Kaettekita Mario Bros. seeks to restore all of those aspects to as close to the arcade version as possible.\n\nKaettekita Mario Bros. was one of the few Famicom Disk System games available exclusively from the Famicom Disk Writer and not sold separately. In addition to the graphics improvements, Mario and Luigi gained the ability to change direction slightly in mid-air, and the game took advantage of its disk format by letting you register your name and save the top five high scores. In 1993, this version of the game was stripped of all of it's sponsorship content, and any contest information, and released in Europe simply as Mario Bros. (but with the label of \"Classic Series\"). This conversion of the game never made it to North America.\n\nIn an unusual move for Nintendo, this game was published in a partnership with a sponsor; Nagatanien, a Japanese producer of seasonings for rice and noodle dishes. As such, the game features in-game advertisements for Nagatanien products, as well as Super Mario Bros. 3, which was released one month prior. The game also featured a contest where players can win Super Mario Bros. 3 merchandise. Mario had also previously appeared on Nagatanien Japanese TV commercials.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb55zig4EVg","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1988-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"c8803405-039a-405f-a123-853c9b6f64cc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"e6349a4e-4d3d-43bc-bc80-b1a7974a945c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"223f1a7f-03bc-48cb-86bc-039d9d0b6854.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"3439786a-f53b-41f6-a110-f55118cd947a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"950d9624-b8fc-48cb-81eb-64c0e5639fac.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"fa6fa40c-b188-4521-9ae5-03c6c9578232.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"f0b3452e-6fdd-4ad3-848b-f2d948892761.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"85e0a302-6bd9-40ac-ae86-3d3a885a01d6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"284f1f68-b79b-48f7-92c7-9e59369a96e7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"4750bb82-d135-4c65-982a-afb8cf0088e6.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"9ba1260c-19ed-4c37-a850-b83516c7f199.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"b0ba7fcf-175e-4115-bfd9-75991f1eedaa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":100065,"FileName":"0d122356-d920-4bee-b520-7655c9702b28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":100065,"AlternateName":"The Return of the Mario Bros.","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":100065,"AlternateName":"Kaettekita Mario Brothers","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":93247,"Name":"Kalin no Tsurugi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The kingdom of Altenia was a peaceful place until monsters began to roam the land, terrorizing its inhabitants and striking fer into the hearts of bravest warriors.

The player navigates the protagonist on a top-down overworld, entering towns and other locations represented by icons. Monsters are visibly moving on the field; a contact with an enemy leads to a separate battle screen, on which the player character and the enemy fight each other. There is no attack button in the game; damage is inflicted by bumping into the enemy, preferably from the side or rear. Weapons, armor and items can be bought in towns and villages.\n\nSince the game is a Disk System game, progress can be saved to disk, and loaded back again. However, the game boasted a Quick-Save feature, which allowed players to save the state of their game into system RAM for much fast recall by the game. Quick-Saves were only good for the lifetime of the system's power, so although writing to disk is slower, it is the only true way to save the game between plays.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UAjULYsZs","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Xtalsoft","Publisher":"DOG","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"48596539-786e-4b8d-a8ee-9abad0f2dce6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"ba900b1d-de24-45f7-9b2a-a1708ed46a51.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"cfe24b97-7565-46be-90fb-705888382887.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"3d496d35-844c-4c29-840b-49f4e984cffa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"4220e1de-44ef-47a3-af6c-190c8a197ed7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"88794949-eec9-4fde-acdb-cba57680e39e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"d4989e48-6d90-4ebf-8578-d68ab59b163a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"2712f1ad-5ef6-47ed-845d-b07895c51684.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"09cca46e-1e9d-4dab-9cf1-fba61a6236a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93247,"FileName":"956c04a6-d10d-48fb-8f26-55e737e9681c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93247,"AlternateName":"The Sword of Kalin","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":93249,"Name":"Kamen Rider Black: Taiketsu Shadow Moon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game is based on the Kamen Rider Black television series, which was the eight installment of the Kamen Rider superhero series.\n\nAfter being kidnapped by the cult Gorgom on the night of their 19th birthday, stepbrothers Kotaro Minami and Nobuhiko Akizuki were submitted to a cyborg surgery with the purpose of becoming the candidates for the next Gorgom Creation King.

Kotaro escaped before getting brainwashed (which is the final step in the surgery), with help from his foster father, and turned against Gorgom. He soon finds out the horrific truth from his stepfather: Gorgom originally killed his true parents and, since both Kotaro and Nobuhiko were born on the day of a solar eclipse, referred as \"Black Sun\" and \"Shadow Moon\". Kotaro, taking on the name of Kamen Rider Black, was determined to rescue his stepbrother from Gorgom while protecting Japan.

This includes cheerleaders during the half-time show (generally not featured in soccer matches, unlike football) and how goalkeepers will irritably kick the goalpost if the rival team scores.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJNzW9vCb8","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"49de36c4-2f4a-4446-bbf7-1725d54a66d4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"7b7571a6-4599-4a57-a980-ff4f13b4a082.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"b90a7eb8-44d2-4fd0-a6eb-d34ddeafd36d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"ec7337d3-41a2-4c26-b517-ff485e1a6c1f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"9b752096-cdc1-4fab-a5cb-2773394f7f9d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"cdf8e254-ba09-4813-a5b5-e6326d86c509.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"d2ef8e77-0324-4c6f-9e8d-673e3d646735.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"f5ae88e0-6c14-4510-aa7f-ab5bb0681fcb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100603,"FileName":"a20aeb1d-f9e3-4579-a750-06c5645d77a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":100604,"Name":"Kick Challenger: Air Foot - Yasai no Kuni no Ashi Senshi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Players take on the role of a walking tomato called Tomatobowerman and get to kick their way to victory against Girabir and his insect army.

Each foot must be maneuvered and placed, one foot at a time, in a system that mimics actual upright walking. Kicks can be fired off in eight directions using whichever foot isn't currently planted. Levels are tailored specifically for this movement style, and simulate hills, narrow pipes, and other hazards that require you to be mindful of where you're planting those tootsies.\n\nPower-ups can be found by kicking the various fauna and bric-a-brac that fill the game's levels. These take the form of shoes that increase the tomato's stride or allow the player to walk on certain surfaces, or various items that give the player temporary abilities. Levels follow a linear upwards progression with no way to retreat backwards except by going through trap doors. In order to progress, the player must find their way through the maze-like levels and defeat the boss waiting at the end of them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNh76SO1Jiw","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Vap","Publisher":"Vap","ReleaseDate":"1987-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"bd8d71cc-5241-4ed8-81eb-ab4b87008d78.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"3126ff66-99e9-4676-a662-33ed2f90cc33.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"cc7c1bb6-f7bf-4713-b584-3f2bda5313ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"a9a0ad5e-6229-43d6-84e0-d396c4a90e82.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"3f381892-b1c8-491a-9ad1-312f9c58b34c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"38056650-421b-4d9e-bdcd-cef46b4eab15.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"d89bbebe-9a6a-4668-8ca6-97b675c4867f.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"3beda809-d3ad-4f10-b058-1d7584481522.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100604,"FileName":"129f5d4d-6c90-4557-9da4-c6c3ea8cb0de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93289,"Name":"Kieta Princess","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Princess Kilala, from the Kingdom of Rabia, has been summoned to Japan to have a discussion about a medicine that has been imported from her country that has been causing dementia to the Japanese public. However, during her visit to Japan, she has suddenly vanished and nobody knows where she has went. Now it's up to the player to play detective and solve this baffling case of the missing princess.\n\nThe game features five different towns to explore. The purpose of exploring the town is to find out information from the locals. While most locals are friendly, some are hostile like the gang members that will fire at anyone getting in their way. Players are armed with a gun that can kill these enemies, but they must be careful not to accidentally fire on too many innocent civilians (or else the player may be arrested and fined). \n\nWhile inside a town, players can also do extracurricular activities such as eating at restaurants, do some training at a dojo, and collect vegetables in order to sell them off for money. The game also features a day-night cycle which can have an effect on who the player runs into while exploring. \n\nSome parts of the investigation will lead the player to play a side-scrolling action platformer. During this part of the game, players have to deal with enemies by shooting them, collect items and money lying around, and sometimes jump on springs to make jumps onto high up platforms.\n\nBeing a part of Imagineer's Wave Jack series, the game also came with extra paraphernalia such as an audio cassette tape and a map. The audio cassette tape contains hints as well as songs from Yasuko Tomita, a Japanese actress and singer. She is also featured on a poster that came with the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvPYUwmRYW0","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Imagineer","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"5dea062e-83ed-4e4a-8447-2bec92f7aeb1.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"9d0d66fe-898a-444b-a377-c9eaa8573594.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"7a62f129-f99d-4b26-b144-fac217e6ec12.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"47c3ebcc-639d-44fa-b4a2-dd851f4a4233.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"ded1cb20-aaee-49c2-b444-f92d4aba4796.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"67457af5-75f7-4636-b35b-81cee53a6c3e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"0dbc7b94-2d44-4b52-af30-b76111a9dd44.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"3c741f30-eaac-4466-99d2-5e1b5c762cd4.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"42ee8c01-12cc-47b3-be56-c5362cbef18f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93289,"FileName":"3bc53b73-1a21-4e6c-a237-61a5cc61fb00.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":100602,"Name":"Kikikai-kai: Dotou Hen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A port of the arcade shooter of the same name, Kikikai-kai: Dotou Hen puts you in the shoes of Shinto priestess Sayo, as she traverses feudal Japan in hopes of rescuing the ancient spirits of luck that have been taken captive by a collection of monsters straight out of Japanese folklore.\n\nThe game plays as a scrolling top-down shooter with complete freedom of movement, which allows for maze-like stages that Sayo must clear of enemies using her ceremonial baton and her mystic energies.

These pitfalls will instantly end the game if the knight lands on them, but at the same time are the only way to score points: Collecting the heart will repair any holes and award points for each one, after which the heart moves to a new space and the game continues. The knight is always moving towards the spot indicated by the player (or to a random default square if the player hasn't acted) and will continue to move faster as the game progresses. This makes it less easy to plan out moves ahead of time and, eventually, difficult to aim the knight in the desired direction before the next move occurs.\n\nThere is also a harder mode: Type B. In this mode the player must collect numerous hearts before the board's gaps are repaired and each heart has a timer: this is the number of moves the knight can make before the heart vanishes and a new one appears elsewhere.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOu4A9l6Wh4","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"JV Dialog","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"7977fdd2-0cac-4720-a0e8-e0aaa9b664ca.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"de066956-434e-4c8f-8534-05d3331a2da6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"322f3353-fb88-444f-b85f-4cf92bc78311.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"1f92892c-c375-40e2-88c5-2227656955a4.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"ba57bf44-78be-4bcf-a44b-fcf89d9268fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"2f94a758-e64c-495a-baa7-192af4a1bacc.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"749234db-9416-4fcc-9d9e-02c7f254b8d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93290,"FileName":"407495b9-2895-4a04-9af5-64cf13b4bce1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93292,"Name":"Kobayashi Hitomi no Hold Up","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kobayashi Hitomi no Hold Up is a puzzle game for adults developed and published by Hacker International for the Famicom Disk System.\n\nIn this solo game, you play a game of Hold Up with the beautiful model Kobayashi Hitomi.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SLRuHOnYeM","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Hacker International","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"2ba493e5-5502-4e43-b463-bc33d9c05d90.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"d9e1b2f7-9599-4efc-bfb6-60cc7eb964ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"ab62b9ce-e583-4875-abca-74c901c0f9d7.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"6caede99-2816-402a-a5dd-fd70d6ec4a35.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"d100a41b-7cb5-4a38-b1f2-08ce823d663e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"8e2f79de-dcb4-4eb6-9065-bafc82463012.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"de77cdba-46b6-4bbc-85db-5e52d04a055b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93292,"FileName":"284935a3-f11a-4bf9-b9f1-8f061c921194.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131865,"Name":"Kobayashi Hitomi Shocking Tennis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kobayashi Hitomi Shocking Tennis is a tennis game for adults developed and published by Hacker International for the Famicom Disk System.\n\nIn this solo game, you play a game of tennis with the beautiful model Kobayashi Hitomi.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Hacker International","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"077534c1-985f-484f-80b1-7d8b59ad46f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"d398b7da-6531-42d7-b0cf-6d519879b5d4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"6da29746-3bd2-42f2-9a8c-28cda08f126a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"11e79a5f-22d8-4bee-8fd3-f77a89642312.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"e72efd73-8f6c-48b1-9c04-6cb0532d498d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"768636d3-81ce-4f4c-b5b4-bb3c16423179.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"016ae122-2b26-44d9-875b-a1f261892df8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131865,"FileName":"de4c9601-c1c9-404a-94c5-aa20fb850e4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":101267,"Name":"Konamic Ice Hockey","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Blades of Steel, later released in Japan as Konamic Ice Hockey is an ice hockey video game released by Konami for North American arcades in 1987, and ported to the Family Computer Disk System and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988.

Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the \"Konamic\" appellation; a portmanteau of \"Konami\" and \"dynamic\". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.\n\nKonamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.\n\nOne feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-08-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"f7db84fe-6a50-4344-8f25-9fe8bd34e9f2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"a69279a1-51b6-4b35-aa44-69632bf56a31.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"20623795-0d21-43e2-a7d2-63687459381b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"0b50aa95-312e-450d-b8b0-5903b5bbaea1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"7ee56c2c-2b47-492f-997d-2751386bbec9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"9a31c9a9-7741-45c7-9aed-c090e7e316e3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"be537d78-4a82-460e-b5e2-7255f6e163aa.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"52271772-c77b-431b-bd92-7c09b4a40dd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":100695,"FileName":"b7c7e08a-0880-49b0-87c0-8733c273ce6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":100695,"AlternateName":"Konami Tennis","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":100696,"Name":"Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game is inspired by the Japanese movie Koneko Monogatari (known in the west as The Adventures of Milo and Otis).

Every two stages counts as a month of time, with one stage counting as daytime and the other as nighttime. The main goal of each stage is to dodge enemies and get to end of the stage unhurt and within the time limit. Although Chatran cannot directly attack enemies, he's not totally defenseless. He can drop any eggs that he has picked up onto his enemies to dispose of them. Chatran can find these eggs plus other items like fruit by jumping into tree leaves thus shaking the items loose. Collecting 50 pieces of fruit will earn Chatran an extra life. There are also eggs that contain letters on them. Spelling out the word HELP will summon Chatran's canine companion Poosky, who can defeat any enemies that gets in his way.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HucMTisD5wc","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Marionette","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1986-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":100696,"FileName":"0df0dac7-3691-4ceb-8032-43479e59a880.png","Type":"Box -

The game has some element of non-linearity, as there are numerous paths that split off to explore. The chief goal is to find keys that unlock doors to new areas and eventually to large, screen-sized bosses that Lutter must defeat in shoot 'em up style boss fights.\n\nThe game also features a few RPG aspects: Lutter has a health bar and can level up, which increases his health and other stats. He defeats enemies by charging into them, similarly to early action RPGs like the first Ys and Hydlide. When defeated, the game will automatically try to bribe the victorious monster with whatever funds the player has accrued: should they have enough to placate the monster (this amount often depends on the strength of the monster) Lutter reappears where he entered the screen with his health restored.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnReBQeGg-8","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Athena","Publisher":"Athena","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"ebcff119-a9b1-49b6-bfdd-cc43bacb6295.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"0192a131-48db-4154-bff3-a633dca55e26.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"e08b66a2-e609-4697-a700-9827d2c2d5eb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"ad763757-1b3c-471d-bfd7-f4331cc05deb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"2e8260be-87ff-4356-aaab-dbb3373ca1e5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"d902ad7c-c1e3-4d30-8e19-dd814af30461.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"b2818a32-4d83-47d4-a9ec-a0a03b987bd4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"b5a658f0-47db-46ad-92f4-676b4e843c83.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"b0de2b43-dae8-41a1-ab4f-710c7a83242e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"24d881ea-1944-40b8-adcd-55a27f583ca9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"8c39b41f-0930-4e03-bc92-a7199b0c6607.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":102457,"FileName":"3ae3c7a4-619a-4087-a17d-2b576cd69e16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93295,"Name":"Maerchen Veil","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A long time ago, people from Ferikusu could communicate with the gods and divine spirits. The king of the kingdom is now looking for a young man to marry his daughter, the royal princess. Many contestants are selected and a tournament is organized to decide of the new prince. However, before the end or the ceremony, an evil magician sends the last hero, the one the princess has fallen in love with, to an unknown and desolated world. He also quickly realizes that he fell under a terrible curse, and he has been turned into a weird creature. The only item he has left is a magic bracelet the princess gave him. The player takes control of the lost prince and his journey will take him back to where he came from, confront the evil magician and marry the princess he loves. Each stage starts with a short animation (called a \"visual stage\") which unfolds the story as the game progresses. The rest of the game follows a classic top-view action formula, where the hero defeats all kind of enemies with the help of his magic powers. Sometimes, special items can be found under tree logs or rocks. \n\nMaerchen Veil for Famicom Disk System combines Maerchen Veil I and Maerchen Veil II from the MSX into one re-designed game. The story includes both parts, evolving through still-screen scenes between stages. Many of the stages are vastly different, with a closer viewpoint, and new types of enemies, terrain and hazards. The difficulty level of this release is also lower compared to the original versions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81qnmIwutv0","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"System Sacom","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1987-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"d9da7194-412c-4841-8a50-8cddeaef7855.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"349b4e32-7f97-40ea-b579-b0c039423669.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"af3bd446-d709-48d5-a1c5-f7d042c26f47.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"da1b163b-30dd-46b5-bdff-1c89b0c75739.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"a5d27a96-fdfe-47b2-8f9c-78df6fc25a76.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"da3e1601-a85e-45da-b677-ca17e26df8dd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"ffa12c58-c591-44bc-93be-18fb70fdd983.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"6f4804b8-ef21-4717-9257-e80fde371e29.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"51fe78c0-95fb-4d8d-9008-4f1e907fa17a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"7034b688-0876-4d78-ba94-ca5984548467.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93295,"FileName":"ba925f4e-5b00-4ce9-970b-e0e02a0e63fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93295,"AlternateName":"Marchen Veil","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93295,"AlternateName":"Marchen Veil","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":103538,"Name":"Magma Project: Hacker","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Magma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC/Amiga/Atari ST strategy game Hacker.

Being a Japanese game, Mahjong for the Nintendo Famicom unsurprisingly\nrevolves around the Japanese version of the game, also known as \"Reach Mahjong\" While originally a game for 4 players, Nintendo for some reason turned it into a two-player game when they released it for their console. This obviously has it's effect on the rules.\n\nThe object of Mahjong is to form a complete hand of tiles before your opponent does so, and before the stack of tiles is empty. The first player to complete a hand is then awarded a number of points depending on how good his hand was (these points are subtracted from your opponent's points. Originally, there were rules to determine which opponents you got these points from, and how many they each had to give up, but since this game only has two players, these rules obviously do not apply here) and the person with the most points after 8 rounds is declared the winner.\n\nThe game is played with small tiles in 5 different suits: Numbers, Circles, Bamboos, Winds and Dragons. The three first suits have 9 different tiles each,\nthe Wind suit has 4, and the Dragon suit has 3. Each individual tile is repeated 4 times, for a total of 136 total tiles.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCjPf7RiAbU","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1986-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"eefd28fe-780c-4f9c-8814-0f7b7987efe1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"69e19ef2-5312-45c6-a7f5-f30d8bb5e177.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"1988447d-3992-4bf9-b722-f7bf81d9be4f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"2a03388b-97c8-43b8-8491-fd8d88ce198d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"8fa3b7b4-36d0-45f7-8d7d-b5f5d91bbfa5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"e4d4df02-294f-4745-9810-31e292ea1e5e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"7577fbbd-39bd-4bea-9510-b1915cca4235.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93291,"FileName":"14f478d8-12ad-4bd2-9d36-c0b5c806fd61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90343,"Name":"Mahjong Goraku: Bishoujo Meijinsen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"As the red-haired girl in the title, you challenge four other girls to strip mahjongg.

It was released exclusively through the Famicom Disk System's \"Disk Writer\" service, where the player must write the game onto an existing FDS disk before playing it. This and Akuu Senki Raijin, released on the same day, would be the last games ever published through the DOG label, as Square decided to focus on cartridge releases for the Famicom after the success of Final Fantasy. No official disk label exists though ones were displayed in magazine ads that have been used.\n\nThe game starts out by depositing the pinball in the middle of a simulated pinball table. However, once the ball is shot into one of the holes on the play field, the game enters an elaborate intro sequence which the player can control. The game contains 11 stages, each of which contain a target hole that the player must hit the ball into in order to advance to the next stage. The stages get more elaborate, and more moving obstacles appear to interfere with the behavior of the ball. In addition to controlling the flippers, the control pad can also be used to \"nudge\" the ball in either direction, although the effectiveness of this varies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctmefO_qjRI","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"System Sacom","Publisher":"Disk Original Group","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"cfe3cffc-908a-4f7b-ac97-ef31b7bfae61.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"536f9aa3-3b9c-4226-9065-4c1a21a54c4f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"af8ed80a-e9c5-4b13-8c13-696f0d24c66f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"14c19d97-a6ce-4059-a656-40f669a2f1fe.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"c2b7edbf-474a-4145-864c-33b10547e4f7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"736a9d43-2222-470c-85c6-3465a63b191d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"fbf5994a-6cba-4e09-b384-e79a90beab8d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"4d43ccc2-57e7-42ac-953e-e6a9a1477dd0.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"8be04ef3-d69c-4570-af06-d33630781e50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103539,"FileName":"d9ad8500-3d8a-428c-97a9-a68b9ed4bf67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":103539,"AlternateName":"Moonball Magic","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":93303,"Name":"Namida no Soukoban Special","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Namida no Soukoban Special (which roughly translates into Warehouse Keeper's Tears Special) is a game that was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 by ASCII Entertainment.

But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx0Ij2BTZSY","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1986-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"5bec15c5-c0d9-4596-968c-f30a8c9c8703.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"c237e5d6-7280-4dd9-b599-9f940fbc769c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"c343b440-8238-4f37-85cb-1c4c7301c744.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"d68b5326-2c6a-4f1c-8e3e-6962af29c6f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"132e9470-f55e-4a51-94db-7a4283a2be8c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"1468cd21-7cd6-4b85-9dd6-d41428925113.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"68e35ddb-816c-40ed-bf16-93ea32f26aad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"d90d8ce9-2580-4142-979c-e222a29e62d8.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"48018fd1-6df6-4151-99b2-0582aa2e8017.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93308,"FileName":"33701f62-2744-4de8-b994-e7d142a41843.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93308,"AlternateName":"The Mysterious Murasame Castle","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93308,"AlternateName":"Nazo no Murasame Jou (Japan) (Translated En) ","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":102431,"Name":"Nazoler Land Special!!: Quiz Ou wo Sagase","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Nazoler Land Special!!

By using the weapon selectively the player can improvise music while playing.\n\nOtocky is notable for being one of the first games that include creative/procedural generative music.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uIdWu1CzJ0","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Music; Shooter","Developer":"Scitron & Art","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1987-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"5a910ae5-b002-403d-a721-c7198e9e83fa.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"a968cb2c-a5aa-4189-af0b-e564b3bd3396.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"8e2af003-1e4a-498d-b577-ff257e3a32da.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"643b5478-c977-4904-a48d-e6a393505601.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"bbab49e9-7bac-4d33-8372-1f4added1874.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"a25d1ffa-0ca0-4aaa-8adc-83a99ec5f88f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"650d82c0-b77b-48df-9ed1-388cd0f2fd08.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"bf20db5b-d9d5-4b73-a0b1-2c1cbb7b76c7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"d0a78fde-2720-4a78-bef1-04eb594044cf.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"32eeaf0e-0321-4d85-ad7f-257d94f80da5.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"7c01700c-a31b-466e-b4a8-78e5fc75ae2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"91757ce0-c610-4c2e-8591-75e611d69b36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"0291d0e8-6c04-4bd6-af44-661bc6efb73e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"d8353ff6-b950-4e2e-bbb0-916e14bb4e32.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"aa5a2b89-be43-4c1b-9d03-00cbe4a438a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"22bc0e53-43fc-4c9d-9d4f-557b05810f53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"b736d570-8b0c-4b2b-ad59-7217a15560fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"f2476ef8-56fe-4c4a-bf79-ebb695e14c02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"86bb75d8-6577-4c65-bb86-3653ae20b6b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"7c6b1766-a84d-461b-8057-176739f83f5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91205,"FileName":"6e10994d-db17-4c43-95ef-8da808b05d37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93320,"Name":"Pachicom","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game is based on standard pachinko rules, replicating the experience of playing pachinko in a parlor. The game board has a layout with nails sticking out. Metal balls would either of or fall in between the holes created by the pegs in order to traverse the board. Certain compartments are added to the board. Should a metal ball find its way to one of these compartments, the player will receive points that are similar to credits on a slot machine.[3] Players can expect to lose that ball (and a point) if it falls below the bottom of the board (similar to falling down a bottomless pit in an action game). Initially, the player starts off with one hundred balls (points).\n\nIn Mode A, the clock goes forward from 000000 seconds until it reaches 999999 seconds (the equivalent of either 16666.65 non-real time minutes, 2777.775 non-real time hours, or 115.740625 non-real time days). Once that occurs, the game is over and any remaining points are stored in the top three score list. Mode B is the same except that the clock goes backwards from 999999 seconds all the way back to 000000 seconds. It is very easy to mash the \"A\" button repeatedly around with the direction pad to the right in order to accumulate mass winnings from the pachinko games and \"cheat\" the system.\n\nThere is a hidden angry rant message that can be found in any hex editor. Almost five percent of the entire ROM (2.05 kilobytes out of the 41 kilobyte ROM image) is taken up by this otherwise inaccessible message. The message is recorded in romaji. It was removed in the Famicom Disk System version.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPkG7eCup5s","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Shouei System","Publisher":"Toshiba EMI","ReleaseDate":"1988-10-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"d37c1a79-1e56-41cf-b83c-23cffd709ffb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"ce92fe40-3196-4d45-9f63-cbc239f09498.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"8bd6c686-4bc7-40fa-a334-d403cdd31b09.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"42a0a862-00b4-450c-8ac8-cf3d4ea0f74b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"b2d19723-a9d3-4462-b3ef-0f8dc03a6f0d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"91a0811b-17d4-4dec-bcf7-86082403b1bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"1b91e8db-7571-4b4f-97fa-80d1c6e10456.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"be89cf07-4849-4768-92e6-9a7cf1a7f11b.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"34c831b0-9fc0-44ca-88fa-9e0020c486ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93320,"FileName":"6710741a-9b33-483c-8e26-a03df5e4ac2a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":103515,"Name":"Pachinko Grand Prix","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pachinko GP (or Pachinko Grand Prix) is a Pachinko simulator from Data East for the Famicom Disk System.

Whenever Pac-Man occupies the same tile as an enemy, he is considered to have collided with that ghost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. \n\nNear the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDNqe6pVf24","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"32b62261-d2c4-4da6-8672-6b9474b6e738.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"d25a8ea0-9036-4307-9298-04bd39c31c0b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"5bb53af9-55f7-49bc-b3be-56d94ff5c014.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"9cd618fe-388a-4aef-a656-a3cce4ba1aae.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"d97c6ef4-e0c5-4e80-b70a-78adc33d060b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"ab431a72-4a76-4cac-bfae-e3e5ed84601d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"9804fa47-fac2-4363-a9b8-12f621c278a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103518,"FileName":"cadfe41e-b8ea-4dae-8bda-c150899b99c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93322,"Name":"Patlabor: The Mobile Police: Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Patlabor: The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo! is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant.

The player controls the flippers on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.\n\nPinball also has a secondary Breakout-like mode, which the player reaches by hitting the ball into a bonus hole that takes the player to a bonus stage where they control Mario carrying a platform. The object of this mode is to rescue Pauline (previously seen in Donkey Kong). The player achieves this by bouncing the ball off Mario's platform and hitting various targets, the destruction of which also earns them points. When the blocks under her are all gone, she will drop. Catching her on Mario's platform earns the player bonus points, but allowing her to hit the ground causes the player to lose.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W19WctyO18Y","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1989-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"54911d02-af22-4a11-ad3a-10e39a660d40.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"5c4c2116-f4b6-45bc-a35a-d82478edafc5.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"b9c3c409-0045-4e26-839a-ef830b29660c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"5ddac8c3-ee23-40ee-b07c-d4453ea1dd53.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"c4f1a940-ac57-4c43-9f39-8c3b306590be.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"e8f43781-7101-4e17-b187-6ee0ff4e8856.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"2ef3412e-7d72-460b-8ff1-06b251e8a8fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"9875601b-49e5-4764-aa7b-888ddf30f3b4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"96c59352-15a6-4df4-8ce9-3053c03a0dfe.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"243af674-e752-4a4a-a5ce-66472d8a1f6b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103529,"FileName":"0da26fab-bd97-460d-b0de-22fdef6b6c92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93323,"Name":"Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament is a golf game with fantasy elements thrown in, developed by Bandai and published on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987.

Pro Wres was also notable for being among the first wrestling games to feature unique wrestler movesets, with each grappler featuring at least one signature manuever.\n\nPro Wres roster includes seven wrestlers, with six playable and one boss character. Normal single player gameplay consists of playing a series of five matches before confronting the V.W.A. champion, King Slender, in a title match. However, when playing as Slender, Great Panther serves as the champion boss. Upon winning the title, the second stage of gameplay consists of defending the title ten times before facing V.W.F. champion Great Puma in an interpromotional match to crown the undisputed wrestling champion and end the game.

The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.\n\nExploration in Pulsar no Hikari seems to follow a set course of scanning nearby space, moving into the next region once it's been ascertained with the long-range scanners that there are no insurmountable obstacles to be encountered there, destroy any asteroids or enemy ships that might be prowling around by checking the short-range scanners and then long-range scan/warp to the next area. Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.\n\nAccidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game.

They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.\n\nReplicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.\n\nThe conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage.

At times, use of the microphone on the second Famicom controller is required to make progress in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175VHmyYAa8","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"863a75db-fbd7-4da3-8022-2e2170154cbc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"e2db4650-8c7f-4206-b3a6-63c80aab2b98.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"367810c5-898c-4fd5-b6e6-6d6f26880aec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"f4e9b687-6fb8-446f-ab10-f141f0dad980.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"94dd38e5-a6ac-4128-aec4-3172a3851c68.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"2c529025-2703-46a4-8eb0-d37ac9c17c64.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"07e8e3de-4738-491a-8f8e-f75858b68847.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"96c613f7-7ecd-4853-8d5a-9e022c51798f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93521,"FileName":"ba54a4a2-46d3-44ac-a1d3-6567f2157708.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":103760,"Name":"Roger Rabbit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Help Roger Rabbit collect hearts in various levels and save Jessica Rabbit while avoiding the dastardly weasels! This was eventually released in the US as Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle and changed the hearts to carrots and the weasels into various characters from Looney Tunes. This was due to Kemco losing the rights to Roger Rabbit in the US.\n\nWhile presented in a side-scroller format, Roger Rabbit differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Roger Rabbit did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Roger avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a \"puzzle-solving\" atmosphere.\n\nPlayers score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y0TdluMWLE","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Kemco","Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"1989-02-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"93c8871d-cad3-4f0c-8728-7a2b6c4c19ab.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"069d5b3c-e7e2-4050-af3f-4d9f1ce15135.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"84703710-3b0e-43fb-a19e-6693f06280f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"a75fcbe7-9275-45fc-ae42-581f6cdc5759.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"833932d0-635f-4ce2-b8d3-380e492b96e5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"a74a60f8-6a0a-4590-914a-aa0552667359.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"d90a07f6-c1a8-42a7-9044-f62a3d250645.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"78fa4ff4-0aea-41cd-bf47-178952cf34a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":103760,"FileName":"81a4bfa7-1fb3-4088-a71c-f1700b03b50a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168212,"Name":"Sailor Fuku Bishoujo Zukan Vol. 1","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Your mission is to climb up the ladders and reach the top where a girl waits for you, while avoiding various objects falling from above.

It was developed and published by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System. Two different versions were released within two months of one another. The initial version was sold in stores for ¥3,300 at the end of 1987 on its own disk with a case. The second version was sold for a much cheaper ¥500 in the beginning of 1988 as part of the \"Disk Writer\" system, where players could bring their own blank disks to a kiosk and have a game of their choice written to the disk. While both versions contain 10 maps to play on, the Disk Writer edition replaces five of the maps from the original edition with new designs. \"Gachapon Senshi\" means toy capsule warrior, as the gachapon toy capsule was a popular format for fans of the series to buy super-deformed versions of their favorite Gundam characters.\n\nWhile the game is considered memorable, especially for being the first in a long line of SD Gundam World games to come, the single-player experience is known for having considerable flaws and a high level of difficulty. While one could forgive the long load times common among the Famicom Disk System games, it was much harder to overlook the exaggeratedly long periods of time that the computer AI took to plan out its moves. This could range from thirty seconds to a several minutes just for one of the three possible commands. Additionally, entering into combat against the computer was a difficult challenge, as the computer opponent played with lightning fast reactions that human players could not compete with without an exceptional amount of practice.

Typically this consists of traveling through a scrolling corridor and reaching the end where a new direction must be chosen. Captain Commando's abilities are shooting directly left or directly right while moving around the screen. Power-ups can be collected by defeated enemies and include; improved lasers, a 3-way cannon and shield, these can be stored until needed. There are also SMS (Special Transmission Shell) power-ups, which require energy to use Energy units, are used to absorb enemy fire.

While its possible to go back and visit already explored and finished areas the game is a lot more linear than the aforementioned Zelda game.\n\nThe player starts out with only a sword as a weapon. Better sword variants can be found and bought and it can eventually also shoot projectiles at enemies, not unlike Zelda again. Other typical items like health refills, ranged weapons, teleport items and a handful of special items that are needed to progress the story, are also incorporated into the game.\n\nIn addition to a normal health bar, which gets reduced when the player comes in contact with enemies, there has to be paid attention to an extra counter that works as a sort of time-limit because it gets lower even when the player doesn't move or does anything at all. When killed, enemies might leave an item behind that increases the counter as well as the chance for a money increase. Money is used to buy stuff from shops which can be found scattered throughout the areas.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyVCfcesMfs","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"C-Lab","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1987-05-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"9d49b4cd-830f-45e1-a0f4-15b42af7b884.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"04ff7cb7-ca19-433d-b38a-cb3f3a8fbe33.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"85dbf36a-071b-4d4a-9918-822c7eb9ef1f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"3a881a11-19c4-489c-b26c-3a1de6e44124.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"ed354c98-18fa-4fad-991f-70f9fdfce56f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"8ed796c0-2561-4d46-8fa7-674cbd48fd54.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"d616b318-edd2-4ccf-9158-41a1067c5d57.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"8ef3db28-e1b1-4049-b6c1-be516105d2bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93538,"FileName":"4e1eec2b-2b7d-4c7c-a74f-0d37c06ba45d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93538,"AlternateName":"Seiken Psycho Calibur - Maju no Mori Densetsu","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":93539,"Name":"Sexy Invaders","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"An adult version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders which upon beating levels you get to see various girls undress.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upv7VBNnSQIAFQjCNHrkGlMZXTJYEjW8FGyDHXIno7mrg&amp;sig2=GRdiovTe318zpQcXl54DrA","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Super Pig","Publisher":"Super Pig","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":93539,"FileName":"57343ee3-7d03-4f08-8a2f-52eec4d1bfbb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93539,"FileName":"148e267d-3b1b-4d42-be56-9faed702dd44.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93539,"FileName":"280d8026-16e6-4310-811b-d4d25f891e10.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93539,"FileName":"ca52805b-1793-4953-bfce-1fa8537c6330.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93539,"FileName":"1c109252-93a3-4dad-b027-649224696be6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93539,"FileName":"44f2616c-8a23-4cf9-813c-b07fffaa3ebd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93541,"Name":"Sexy Yakyuuken Adventure II: Gal's Dungeon Part","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig.\n\nYou play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious \"Phantom of 40 Faces\".

She decides to head out and find this Dr. Doppler, and convince him to give her the medicine.

Throughout the game, the player wanders around a world map in order to find towns where goods may be purchased, and caves or towers which must be explored to find treasure.

Rather than putting the emphasis on precise control and placement of the paddle in order to return the ball, the emphasis is on timing and strategic control of the ball's speed and trajectory. The player sees no other on-screen representation of themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the choice of forehand or backhand. \n\nThe Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side. The conversion offers several variations of play, including one or two player games, plays to 11 or 21 points, and five levels of difficulty.

New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an enemy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdq73rb2rvE","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo R&D4","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1986-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"2e0e9360-4d07-428e-bc29-4534fff757c7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"845ea8a6-1309-43f5-882e-04b6b95ab447.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"8b36b037-2f1a-46d0-8cb3-9da107389945.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"d01e2894-7558-4b83-85f1-77e6b3ff51af.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"de4aec0b-b957-4ad5-bd83-14fa9e77ef3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"adedea01-aa5d-4a0c-a466-4b02f8f20b5a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"bf732b8c-0bda-410d-a3ee-2a1db7dc7796.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"7195766d-9e46-4572-810a-8ab269f2afbf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"02a3975a-0ced-4073-9b14-280d4221786a.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"9019229a-3454-4cae-b2b8-da12cc424e50.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"2031b825-4552-4a7a-81a1-eebe653a51cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90377,"FileName":"b6c56207-5a23-44cb-bdf4-29766bc45f0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":90377,"AlternateName":"Super Mario Brothers 2","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90377,"AlternateName":"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":90377,"AlternateName":"Super Mario Bros. 2","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":102441,"Name":"Tama & Friends: 3 Choume Daibouken","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game is based on a manga and anime for children of the same name that concerns the cats and dogs of a close-knit neighborhood. \n\n\n\nThe game has a subtitle: 3 Choume Daibouken.

The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and RPG-style elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor and has given it a reputation as the \"black sheep\" of the Zelda series. It is arguably the hardest Zelda game. Despite this reputation, the game was highly successful and introduced many elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD1nl6VuNNo","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"e3ff9709-c630-4ddb-ac76-14235eb9eee6.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"2d81204d-177d-4ae1-aeae-2bf98769fac8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"bd56b9b5-fdb9-45f3-9037-f373592208bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"9f501bd8-f6e3-45c9-a66e-89a81a08c3d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"bc4ca241-d501-44ba-9c92-c38f65c1a5c1.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"2c49bd04-74d8-45ac-a719-27b9415a256d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"9a15ffa2-81da-41fa-8879-d46b001cd9f5.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"682cc200-90fc-4704-b47a-f8c0941167d0.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"78b70a33-5fa3-4b81-9a08-7c137ae502e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":91921,"FileName":"59c4d8bf-ce91-4003-9cc5-69deff29884a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":91921,"AlternateName":"Legend of Zelda 2, The: Link no Bouken","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91921,"AlternateName":"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91921,"AlternateName":"Link no Bouken: The Legend of Zelda 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":93602,"Name":"The Monitor Puzzle Kineko: Kinetic Connection","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Monitor Puzzle Kinetic Connection: Kineco is a puzzle game, where the player must piece together ten images in a jigsaw puzzle like fashion.

Unlike it predecessor, Transformers: Convoy no Nazo, players cannot switch between robot and vehicle mode. Instead, each level contains an initial vehicle mode stage, followed by a robot mode stage. Players start out with only Chromedome. They can switch between Autobots at any time, but only if that Autobot has been collected. Players must rescue them throughout the game, as they will be flown in by helicopter in the vehicle mode stage, or found in one of the rooms of the robot mode stage.

Players must send a team out to search for, and obtain, a cube which permits the defense team to damage monsters when they appear. Once the cube is found, monsters begin to appear and attack the buildings of Japan. The team must deploy vehicles to help aid in the destruction of these monsters until they have all been defeated.

This game is the first Famicom game dealing with Ultraman.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent as Hayate, a raygun-sporting agent of the Science Special Search Party, an organization founded to defend the Earth from alien threats. He is limited to a short jump and his raygun, though both tend to be sufficient for taking care of smaller enemies and other minor obstacles.\n\nShould Hayate collect enough power from fallen enemies (and from the environment), he is able to transform into Ultraman: A building-sized robotic fighter with a range of special powers. However, Hayate can only stay as Ultraman for three minutes, and all of Ultraman's powers save his basic fighting moves can only be used once per transformation. At the end of each stage (and occasionally partway through) there is a different kaiju from the TV show that Hayate needs to defeat. It is highly recommended that the player find a way to transform into Ultraman if they wish to defeat these larger foes.\n\nIf all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhNpeq_Ulro","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Bandai","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"d039bec6-9c69-4845-b001-34994a50e7db.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"87949134-9b7a-461c-a325-c293e3a24f59.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"95467a89-ffec-408b-a0a1-2bad6d6c0755.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"40a20ab0-674d-4274-8886-b888174a0cae.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"8d169e94-dfb0-49ba-84a1-87c8f73504f0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"f3cadc1e-49f9-409a-86da-94ff1f837141.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"8c8f6322-1f78-461a-a452-b2ab65e72548.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"eab989af-1ec7-4703-badb-86690dda3959.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"9c34566b-4d1b-4cb2-9014-ff332cbc38d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93673,"FileName":"5a9e39ef-f356-4993-8f0a-edda60f591a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":93673,"AlternateName":"Ultraman - Kaijuteikoku no Gyakusyu","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":93673,"AlternateName":"Ultraman: Kaijuteikoku no Gyakusyu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":93740,"Name":"Volleyball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Slam the perfect serve.

Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA. \n\nThe story starts with two children, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky dream world. \n\nDoki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save each character's progress).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXdUMAov7s4","Platform":"Nintendo Famicom Disk System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"0fbcc0a5-0095-4511-b0d9-e9e841a271a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"19c71c63-dcb2-4dd7-956b-d31e1218a5db.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"e8f81f49-f13d-440f-9426-a38f5bc33022.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"1a9d547a-28f6-4aae-8287-d67f22d96941.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"ee6bf50c-0014-4e78-8701-dafb5d974471.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"e5b07463-5cca-45ac-9907-f9ded1a25dad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"bf2d88e1-e8c8-451e-9bff-01e743cde32d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"669d885e-3bdf-43fa-b97a-881f57a5d4aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"d37ec126-e973-4c9f-b7e7-f8b2daf02e0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"d1c238d8-42ab-4abf-a8a0-f69add4eb42b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90597,"FileName":"f9d834b0-1d7f-47be-817a-337b4d770f50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":90597,"AlternateName":"Dream World: Doki Doki Panic!","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":93743,"Name":"Yuu Maze","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Yuu Maze (\"Maze Play\", also spelled Youmais according to its title screen) is a single-screen maze game akin to Namco's classic Pac-Man and its many other imitators in that the goal of the game is to drive the futuristic vehicle around a maze collecting dots while avoiding (or temporarily eliminating) the enemies.\n\nYuu Maze adds a few innovations to the format: Each maze has a different structure, different enemies and different lay-outs for the pellets that are required to complete the level; the player can find power-ups which grant weapons, shields and speed-ups to their vehicle.
