Super Lode Runner II has fewer single-player levels than its predecessor, but contains more co-op levels to make up for it.\n\nThe gameplay is largely identical to that of the original Lode Runner: Players must collect all the gold on a stage and leave via a ladder. They must also avoid the enemies around the stage, which tend to home in on the player. In order to defend themselves, the player character can dig holes at their feet which can trap enemies and will also allow the protagonist to reach buried gold. Each level tends to have a specific strategy to it that the player must puzzle out if they intend to progress.","Publisher":"Irem","ReleaseDate":"1987-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S1z621gEBdo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lode_Runner"},"30939":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft Pro International","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"d8cbf920-6d6c-427f-a1d7-42b525f6363a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36e3f546-85d2-49aa-a30b-de530b026dfc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46b6f2d5-28fb-47b6-9133-fd1c71186b2c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"f7f5bcd2-4d62-496d-9f37-57addd9c26cb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7b18537a-2dc2-4321-9bb0-098119e91208.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"73852430-1cf4-4629-9d4d-bab9e18bb5ad.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"29160d3e-c6ed-4859-a21e-74952e9db071.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d3a5e85f-5c72-4fb5-bdc2-bb573ac854eb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pulsar no Hikari: Space Wars Simulation","Overview":"Pulsar no Hikari (\"Pulsar of Light\"): Space Wars Simulation is a game for the FDS created by computer game developer Soft Pro International. It's a rather dense strategic space simulator that has the player control a starship as it explores a galaxy and fights off enemy ships. The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.\n\nExploration in Pulsar no Hikari seems to follow a set course of scanning nearby space, moving into the next region once it's been ascertained with the long-range scanners that there are no insurmountable obstacles to be encountered there, destroy any asteroids or enemy ships that might be prowling around by checking the short-range scanners and then long-range scan\/warp to the next area. Once the ship's energy\/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.\n\nAccidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game. It's generally considered a bad idea.","Publisher":"Soft Pro International","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"90301":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ASK Kodansha","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"aacf5481-25b5-4fff-b248-fc92e9bfc9b9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"704eed85-59ec-4732-9af9-b2db3151ffb7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ff7297a1-dcff-4a06-8754-240a31918bac.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"288f26a1-c8e9-42a7-8c0f-42695f6f5774.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5bcf4ace-170a-46e9-8551-540fac72cba0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eb0b4a94-6b2f-426b-ae24-524a1fbc40c1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"ffc1cb2f-d790-4e17-a3eb-63e0b24ccf5e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"33ac120f-9a92-48ad-a336-50259024cd01.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"45d26d30-dcd8-4504-8dec-2f2b511ec514.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"58272267-d773-434d-9552-baf407f8904b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f19a8c67-aeec-4e19-8c0b-2db4bfac5804.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"38c76608-9cb2-49ad-ac28-de415d3dd8b5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Adian No Tsue","Overview":"Adian No Tsue is not a traditional adventure game - It is most and foremost an educational game designed to appeal to a young audience. It is also the first installment of a series of games released in Japan by SunSoft. The player takes control of a courageous knight and the game follows a traditional overhead display which somehow bears some resemblance to Nintendo's Zelda. Each room is usually filled up with monsters and four doors lead to other surrounding rooms, different locations or just hide special items. However, the only way for our hero to pass these doors is to solve simple arithmetic equations. Numbers from 0 to 9 appear on two sides of the room and the knight must run around the room and touch them to display the right answer. Yet, these expressions are very simple and only use simple additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions. Nonetheless, solving them while running around the rooms and hitting crazy skeletons with a sword can be a challenging task. The other side of the disk contains a simple marathon game also based on arithmetic challenges.","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-12T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ObahVqBE6R0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/strategywiki.org\/wiki\/Adian_no_Tsue"},"90319":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Taito","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a7374ae4-7152-45db-bea0-c89faff21700.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9dcd09d6-d8ba-4bba-a1be-a0b06b8b3718.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1a76a146-70e1-4908-a95e-99c6567afd5f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5e4a0567-218d-4948-8604-23d64566ca34.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"44e6f9bb-5cb8-44ac-9e1a-f08dcac2e2c8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5df635b5-63e7-4209-a5b4-ff1154499765.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b3b776ac-cf41-4523-aa1b-026c194003df.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3f0205a1-5a81-4b59-a9b3-4de3da916a0e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7bb1caf4-bdfe-4360-aada-3d9db8504244.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7d27789d-88c5-4614-ba8e-cfd58b22cb19.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a40f2c9c-77cf-48b3-9c88-523003bfd721.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"00073450-38fd-47bb-ad5f-e35da058319a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bubble Bobble","Overview":"In the game's plot, \"Baron Von Blubba\" has kidnapped the brothers Bubby and Bobby's girlfriends and turned the brothers into Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob.

Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas. Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning.

Gameplay largely involves simply watching the girl go about their daily life. She wanders the house, occasionally doing activities like exercising, reading, brushing her teeth, feeding herself, sleeping, or even playing a game on her Famicom. The time of day is tracked on an in-game clock, on which 5 minutes is only a few seconds in real time.\n\nSimple requests can be selected from the menu bar. These include making the phone ring, sending the girl a letter, sending her to purchase food or milk, feeding the cat, sending her a Famicom game as a gift, and having her perform a song on the piano. The girl only stores a few boxes of food and bottles of milk, and must be sent out to retrieve more before she runs out. If left neglected for too long, the girl will become angry, and may leave the house and never return.\n\nOne option in the menu allows the player to have their fortune told by the girl. This can be done through a blood-type compatibility test, a horoscope, or a variation of tarot using playing cards.","Publisher":"Disk Original Group","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FR8v7juMceQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little_Computer_People"},"90330":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Aspic - Mahebiou no Noroi","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Aspic: Mahebiou no Noroi"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Xtalsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f38733df-91e7-4caa-b9d0-e19c6a7231da.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"83792572-cb26-4118-b3d3-79dc7ac0780c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3c6f3f36-2b02-4360-b7a6-cf476128ff61.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"c1b7cbc7-6bfa-49a8-ab45-55cd04e8d12a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a37f89b3-a4ff-49e8-9912-47ffe2ab6aa0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"55e22175-9980-43e5-9745-9b1420236c78.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e24a538f-0b92-48ba-bf02-fb748204c579.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"35579def-d208-4406-a151-4c75f5ee7d3f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"756cb747-4598-4540-9ca3-838c471a1e0f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aspic: Majaou no Noroi","Overview":"Aspic is the sequel to one of Xtalsoft's earlier games, Lizard.

All that flies is not an enemy, though; you can also shoot at blocks that, when shot, make up a picture of a pretty girl on the right of the screen. Picking up bonuses in the shape of the signs for \"pretty girl\" powers up your weapon. When all pieces of the picture are picked up, you are given a chance to enjoy the picture at your own pace before progressing to the next level (and the next girl).\n\nThe gameplay can be spiced up by upgrading your spaceship into a much more \"phallic\" configuration, with bullets looking like big sperm, while the enemies come in the shape of scissors, mouths, pants and syringes. Your ship can also gain a condom shield. Whereas the MSX version starts off like a more normal shooter, progressively becoming more vulgar, this is the default mode in the Famicom version.","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x0su2azCWtc"},"90335":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Demonic Castle Dracula"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b3ad5818-d4a6-4043-8ad5-55a0e09be873.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"26195013-897d-465a-be6f-bb020d0b9419.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"493a9118-1a2b-4589-97a3-d6bd744be066.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5d2ef130-4dad-456c-a1c4-809d7dcf71cb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97dce464-8f69-4129-8864-718ec030afe3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d0e7208-e630-4049-a46c-221421d933bc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c8255cae-5235-4371-af62-d76d570f1b78.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"de304ce7-8565-49e6-bff9-cd9aac845024.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0f14b005-cc38-4af5-8c9f-7e237eef642c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ea3b4fba-4bb6-450d-b173-ff86361d3c15.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3e36b4f4-f198-4ae8-aa53-65e59b6d59a5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a619a240-b368-44ae-99aa-7160b12dfc1c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b01b3951-2ba6-4c94-a890-94d852d67708.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9d34bff3-626f-4705-ba4d-d09abc3d2004.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"345e2e55-1d1c-40a7-aaa1-3fef09b9e75a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a722b59b-1ecc-4b07-879b-aada0c790d18.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Akumajou Dracula","Overview":"Every hundred years, the dark vampire known as Dracula resurrects and terrorizes the land.

The player takes the role of Simon Belmont, who is able to jump and crack his whip directly in front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by defeating enemies or by whipping candles that appear in the castle. One such power-up increases the power and length of Simon's whip. Different weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when used, these hearts can also be collected from monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls will hide secrets such as the health-restorative turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for the weapons Simon has collected.

And so, in order to save his kingdom, Upa crawls into action...\n\nIn this game, you control a little baby. The baby crawls through imaginary worlds, made of candy, chocolate, toys, and other things a baby would dream of. It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HMPi3THogsY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bio_Miracle_Bokutte_Upa"},"90343":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Indies Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"4dda3470-6bb1-436f-b452-14a1c6ee8242.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"79fb3592-da1b-4a03-a5a8-77aec1449da5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"07d064bf-94cf-4119-a862-5be6f27ada38.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3f78bf23-0e3a-4819-97da-13100c013c37.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"ec6df438-7963-46f5-926f-cb652e059710.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8e34977d-a1fd-486b-b168-aa92093dc4cd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f82219aa-9798-42f4-819e-83741aa507a7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mahjong Goraku: Bishoujo Meijinsen","Overview":"As the red-haired girl in the title, you challenge four other girls to strip mahjongg.

Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA. \n\nThe story starts with two children, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky dream world. \n\nDoki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save each character's progress).","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PXdUMAov7s4"},"90655":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Pretty Girl's Sexy Derby","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hacker International","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"803dd08d-26b1-4145-9eb0-c90f474a54fc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6810e8cf-3c35-4dec-9b1a-f86353431d40.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a942002a-1261-42ac-a620-41a3762011b0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"ad24cdc3-f46b-4584-bdac-0343777c4d89.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bb1e6885-6aef-4c59-8abf-016959196171.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f0e46f2c-6d5a-4058-a584-c93e42cd0949.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44c57812-d41c-4675-9df6-66acc0064d72.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"828c4394-3ab4-42ad-b7f5-1871cf680223.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d4eb1809-5100-470f-858c-c63781ca8386.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bishoujo Sexy Derby","Overview":"An adult game in which you pick from four girls and race the designated horse to earn points.

A vast list of components can be edited and customized from the start and the game counts seven different types of robots ( 2 legs, 4 legs, snake, hover, 3 tires, 6 tires and Belt). 1000 points are given to the player and they need to be strategically spent over fifteen abilities - from speed, dexterity to luck and IQ. When the player robot is ready, it can be activated and fight in a special arena. However, the fight is totally controlled by the CPU - so the player just sits down and watch the action until his robot wins, or loses. Up to eight robots can be saved on the Disk Card.","Publisher":"Soft Pro International","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"91184":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Deep Dungeon II - Yushi no Monshou","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Yuushi no Monshou: Deep Dungeon","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Deep Dungeon II: The Hero's Crest"},{"AlternateName":"Yuushi no Monshou: Deep Dungeon"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"c4e58b58-31e0-4b20-8c6b-698c31fa712d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"babc6765-baeb-43e4-9681-669e489e401e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0034e927-10a3-4af4-bf84-baa32277cd67.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7b542999-f5a8-4893-aa02-2841dcc98d3b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"368c8359-25e8-421f-a8ea-6082e9dde86f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e8bb94f4-8efe-4323-b316-8392b71447d4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a606de10-4de4-4f21-8742-1b7487cd1286.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d41ffde4-5cf9-4e30-94fa-d3a27c272e4d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40bb91f3-8fc0-4c22-90c2-153cf4ece86d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2ce9ed62-4531-4e0f-b845-018fbbb36bab.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Deep Dungeon II: Yuushi no Monshou","Overview":"The second game in the Deep Dungeon series, Yuushi no Monshou (lit: \"Crest of the Hero\") is a first-person 3D dungeon crawler RPG in the mold of Wizardry or Dungeon Master. \n\nThe goal of the game is to reach the end of the dungeon with the hero, defeating all manner of monsters and finding treasure along the way.

Once their destination is reached, the game switches to a more static room mode where Kei infiltrates a building and move from room to room, looking for items such as floppy discs and unlock doors.

There, a menu allows the player to open doors, windows, drawers or closets in order to find new weapons (gun, machine gun, grenade, ammo) or life saving items (mainly health potions). Rooms lie at the heart of the gameplay and hide many secrets - for instance, hitting a wall can reveal secret passageways or release special items. The dimensional zones can only be accessed from these rooms, and they all follow a traditional side-scrolling structure, each ending with a boss. Defeating them reward the player with a piece of the laser gun, as well as some special items, such as the Zone Detector (which helps in locating the remaining zones).","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1987-06-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1cVqq9scftM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dr._Chaos"},"91187":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Firebird","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"be002172-4cdd-4cad-ac6f-755131c6d948.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"97a723a4-67b7-4838-bd72-667cc068f6a0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5d959c0-3596-4f0f-8b28-1ecd94a0d6d7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"4eaaf84e-88be-4cc2-93d4-feacd9cfba1d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2b31b5e6-a525-42d4-a99f-76baaa1914f5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e951e646-dfcf-4875-8123-76ebf32361fd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ed5570bf-3f00-4649-971a-d7e8444e25a0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ae0b084f-a09a-438c-99bb-cbbb30f1e3ee.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Druid: Kyoufu no Tobira","Overview":"Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet.

Much of the game's resources and levels actually come from Eggerland Mystery 2, though there's a lot of extra elements as well. The series would become better known in the West as Adventures of Lolo.\n\nThe game features Prince Lolo and his attempts to rescue his girlfriend Lala from the diabolical King Egger by solving a series of puzzle rooms involving collecting hearts and avoiding enemies.\n\nThis game is of the \"labyrinth\" model of Eggerland games which, unlike the sequential \"tower\" format evident in the Adventures of Lolo series, provides the player with non-linear branching paths to follow in the form of multiple exits for each stage. Besides that, the usual rules apply: Lolo must find and collect all the heart icons in a given stage and then reach an exit, though it's worth keeping in mind that many of the monsters are completely inert until the last heart icon is collected, at which point they wake up and become very dangerous. As well as ensuring that they are able to reach all the heart icons, the player must also make sure to prepare a safe path to the exit for when the monsters awake.","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-29T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LfX_YlRuS1Q","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eggerland"},"91455":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"5016dbbf-68d2-4b04-b6ba-f314b3b820b0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c21155a9-2eaa-4f42-a20e-c862be27aea6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a1696411-21f9-4633-88dc-f41cfa54fbd5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"cc280449-a42f-4d5b-87f5-7619b8a41e46.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"77f1806c-bf37-4674-9612-9489cf8a1102.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cea0cc45-addf-48fb-ab76-f26440ec77d7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d0950623-83cf-41ae-bdf9-b06202d6caaa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"413b639c-b87b-46aa-a047-449dbdd27e15.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8db8bde2-71d1-4f17-8319-8933d8ef1fb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b23a4755-f5f4-4a24-ad97-602acd565030.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Esper Dream","Overview":"Brick Town, a town within a storybook, is in peril! Evil forces have descended upon the land and kidnapped the mayor's daughter. And it just so happens that you have ESP. Thus it descends upon you - and your gun - to save Brick Town.\n\nUnlike most other RPGs of the time, Esper Dream isn't based on medieval times, but rather on a fairy tale storybook of five chapters, each with a setting that is distinct from each other (they also contain sub-dungeons). Battles are started when the player runs into various pairs of moving footprints on the ground. This takes the player to a separate enclosed battlefield. There the player can use their weapons (or ESP powers) to defeat their enemies. Winning battles will increase the player's character's experience points, eventually leveling them up when they reach certain experience point totals. Leveling up increases their Hit Points (HP) and ESP Points (EP). The player can also buy weapons by using the Gold Pieces that defeated enemies leave behind.\n\nThe game is over when the player's HP reaches zero - or when the player has successfully saved Brick Town from the evil scourge.\n\nUp to three save slots are available. They allow players the opportunity to save their progress and return to their adventure at a later date.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-02-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CNH6fxe6xy4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Esper_Dream"},"91601":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"be014182-4a14-462a-8bfc-39ec8dfe2e09.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b933fbcd-c4f2-46db-8af5-a695851f0ee7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74c99718-2063-41c9-8f84-c70321c953b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"eec47554-fb68-4c7b-b7cb-4985cfb37646.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9ff40ffc-64fc-4dad-a8f5-7f0a8e90cae1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"db6dc7b4-f2bd-406f-8e1a-2dad9ac55518.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8e331615-1b19-41f4-b13a-f339cfb2725e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40a09dca-7015-456f-9c77-f02a9db85b96.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Exciting Baseball","Overview":"Exciting Baseball is a baseball game developed by Konami and published for the Family Computer Disk System towards the end of 1987 as part of Konami's Exciting Sports series of games.

In 21XX, humanity has colonized space. But during its quest to find more habitable planets, humans have faced an aggressive alien race who wants nothing but destruction. Their fleet has now entered our solar system and hurls towards Earth. Only the new Falsion spacecraft and its courageous pilot stand a chance to save humanity from destruction. It will be a long journey through six varied stages, from asteroid fields to narrow and deep canyons. The craft can use a simple Vulcan laser gun or secondary, and in limited supplies, homing missiles. Power-ups, in the shape of floating orbs stamped with the letter P, sometimes appear from defeated enemies. Blue ones speed-up the ship and red ones increase the depleting stock of homing missiles. The greatest feature of this unusual title is certainly the 3D option, which can be activated from the option menu or by pressing select at anytime during the game (Nintendo's official 3D glasses must be used though).","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fEVwMAJjcLk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Falsion"},"92512":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Family Computer Golf Tournament - Japan Course","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Golf: Japan Course"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"16937f53-85b5-42e6-8b98-15176ca30f1e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c0ffcade-7949-4a30-b8e0-4cf603c0be13.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"83d23233-27ce-4c89-b943-064422b35827.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"e84b6cf0-c140-4cc8-9efe-c4514ce567b2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a2a5cb06-e9e5-4e51-a260-edb4127ce9a3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8e1a702c-eca2-4c95-bf8e-74ffc8b3be11.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"08e14713-c3f9-4ea7-ad40-3814d76f148a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a6901afe-c37b-4154-a879-765a55ed5322.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Family Computer Golf: Japan Course","Overview":"An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.\n\nPlayers can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.\n\nWhen on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.\n\nThis game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nFgDqscCyMY"},"92513":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Golf: U.S. Course"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e73404f4-b9ea-4acf-8121-1cc457483900.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"250e53a7-372f-4f74-8899-aebb292bff1e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b410aaae-fbad-4c06-8412-4e44b96fe566.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"b413f711-78aa-4ba1-adc6-5c236b02a893.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2fd5a949-0047-47d3-8a74-2218281618ca.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"70e2e2c2-759a-434d-8f18-e8200116e00d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9da58f31-2125-4503-9af3-06b325e57c00.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d18a9ef3-a805-41b6-b702-3387b14b4aa0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5f0192bf-e9d9-4102-9578-45b49bf91bd6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course","Overview":"A companion title to the earlier Japan Course, Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course focuses on American courses.

In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view similar to Outrun and Rad Racer. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.\n\nIn order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.\n\nAs the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1988-04-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mFc2PpToqGk"},"92965":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"641845ca-649b-4876-b527-0f3ca510f0b3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"98e09406-b7a8-44c8-94ec-61f51dc50140.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d3d4f9b6-e7b9-484a-981e-997dad95d313.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"b47f9ee4-3ab9-4456-a8ff-a268417a6ca7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8c4781f2-2ca4-47a4-9587-10c50b38fc12.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e843b51e-ecef-4723-b1b5-b5dcc9c9602b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dd066f0a-e6d4-4846-be48-b4d08ab0bae8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cb770ab9-ad21-477f-87bc-732d3e603c4a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"edac5912-ca51-4106-8a95-e8cb107fc5cd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Famicom Mukashibanashi: Yuuyuuki - Kouhen","Overview":"Famicom Mukashibanashi: Yuuyuuki (\"Famicom Fairy Tales: Yuuyuuki\") is the second of two text adventure games in the Famicom Mukashibanashi series developed by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves for the Famicom Disk System peripheral.

An ability to switch between Goku and Chao is frequently available as well.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"93046":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo R&D1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"25593c72-95c4-4d6a-b03e-5d04f7d1743f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a9950597-3aab-4fe3-bbdb-5e39a053c689.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5bf4387a-621b-4160-9f98-c446b529edce.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"0a94a71a-4bfe-4ba3-9f4b-8b1cbd498c78.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d2fad157-c7f3-4aa9-b475-0b37ecd34bbc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a46958f6-b71a-4c77-8c45-bfda8551a667.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"223d634a-c4ed-4998-a9c2-3b22006af247.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"943abf55-f6ac-4412-a38d-97978de88216.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Koukeisha: Kouhen","Overview":"Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Koukeisha is a text adventure game.

Unlike the two previous Famicom games, it is of the \"tower\" format, where stages follow consecutively one after the other, rather than the \"labyrinth\" format where Lolo has some non-linear freedom as to where to go next. The tower format would also be the one adopted for the next three games - the Adventures of Lolo series.\n\nSouzouhe no Tabidachi was created as part of Nintendo's \"Disk Writer\" service, wherein a Nintendo Famicom Disk System owner could take a disk to a special kiosk found in video game stores and have one of a selection of games written onto it; the idea being that the player could beat the game and then have their disk rewritten with a new game for a nominal fee. Souzouhe no Tabidachi is one of the few games that could only be procured from one of these Disk Writer machines, making it a rare find for collectors.\n\nAs with the other Eggerland games, the goal is to help Prince Lolo collect every heart-shaped icon on the screen and return to a key that appears once all the hearts are collected. However, many of the enemies will only become aggressive once the last heart icon is collected and the key appears, which means some strategy is required regarding which heart icons to collect in what order as well as planning a safe route to the key. Lolo has a few tools at his disposal, such as turning enemies into eggs and using the harmless Snakey creatures as shields.","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseDate":"1988-08-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zgBxqzIoMak","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eggerland#Eggerland_Mystery"},"93194":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Live Planning","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a084e3c7-5cc1-4a35-a2c2-6e75bbeba77d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"4517b75c-4c05-4362-85ff-9bd5da0e775a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dcd101cc-7a5c-4d56-ab6f-aaf9fa291cde.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5aefa44e-377f-4978-8865-59a6e80f64b4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"9a9cd2e8-f44f-4eb1-9998-09a6b2632651.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eaeb1b96-3652-48ca-b35f-bada9010c493.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bc64ef7a-30cd-434a-bc1b-19ba0e2a24cc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"63c4e1a9-f8bc-4168-ab6a-a094f6e6cd0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7dd1da69-c0fe-4ba0-8b94-5e69f539ac9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fire Bam","Overview":"Bam must explore a world and \"unfold\" it into its full size by exploring towers and defeating boss characters inside.

The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.\n\nPrior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to \"Connect Four\" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 × 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 × 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BAoEO0o0jdg"},"93236":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Thinking Rabbit","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"68a7453a-186a-47ff-ac06-8768f95aed28.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"08aa3763-f63b-4a29-a707-82ce1bb9a89b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"76393c18-6ebc-4495-a8b6-4f5df6aeddd9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0f091883-f7ca-4088-9154-fae18ea32870.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"a44996e1-67b8-4d3a-8bfb-e2b71f1d50c6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a8f58e2d-22dd-4a04-9a88-f2674113815a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d75f4116-c450-47c2-9b94-99545efc2fcc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd5e8041-da91-4901-bd64-9578a704547e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c8a0f9c7-96ab-48c7-a4df-7e5485f77492.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4191ef97-19de-446b-8994-2b11eeafe45f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jikai Shounen Met Mag","Overview":"Jikai Shounen Mettomag (\"Magnetic Children Mettomag\") is a puzzle game developed by Thinking Rabbit for the Famicom Disk System.

However, the game boasted a Quick-Save feature, which allowed players to save the state of their game into system RAM for much fast recall by the game.

Both of them are called Century Kings and are destined to best each other in a final battle - whoever wins will become the next Creation King. Kotaro escaped before getting brainwashed (which is the final step in the surgery), with help from his foster father, and turned against Gorgom. He soon finds out the horrific truth from his stepfather: Gorgom originally killed his true parents and, since both Kotaro and Nobuhiko were born on the day of a solar eclipse, referred as \"Black Sun\" and \"Shadow Moon\". Kotaro, taking on the name of Kamen Rider Black, was determined to rescue his stepbrother from Gorgom while protecting Japan. However, later in the series, Nobuhiko emerged as Shadow Moon to fight Kotaro with the survivor becoming the next Creation King.\n\nIn the game, players take control of Kamen Rider Black, who must defeat numerous Gorgom mutants. There are five levels of four stages each. In the first four levels, players must complete three side scrolling stages with a boss at the end. In the fourth stage, the player must fight against a final level boss using a zoomed in perspective with larger sprites. The player gets to ride Battle Hopper motorcycle throughout the second and fourth levels. The fifth level is composed entirely of boss fights, first against three Evil Lords, and then against Shadow Moon.

While Palutena administered the light and helped the mortals cultivate their crops, Medusa despised the mortals and used the darkness to destroy their crops and turn the mortals into stone. Enraged, Palutena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster and banished her into the dark Underworld.\n\nBut Medusa would not go quietly. She assembled an army of monsters and evil spirits of the underworld to conquer Palutena's home, the Palace in the Sky. War erupted and Medusa's minions overwhelmed Palutena's army, eventually imprisoning the Goddess of Light. Medusa then seized the Three Sacred Treasures—the Mirror Shield, the Arrow of Light, and the Wings of Pegasus—and gave them to her most powerful minions.\n\nDefeated and imprisoned, Palutena's only hope was to seek the help of Pit, a young angel trapped in the Underworld. Using the last of her strength, she sent Pit a magical bow. Thus, Pit set out on a quest to escape the Underworld, retrieve the Sacred Treasures that would help him defeat Medusa, and rescue Palutena and restore peace to Angel Land.\n\nThe original Famicom Disk System versions feature save slots, unlike the North American version which uses a password system (known in-game as \"Sacred Words\"). As with Metroid, the FDS version of Kid Icarus also features higher-quality music and sound effects that take advantage of the system's additional sound channels.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GW5xy7Ush5w","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kid_Icarus"},"93288":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hacker International","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c2f9850b-b6f3-4651-ac3f-b51c566fd037.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"755a44cd-d424-46f2-8fb0-71b4212384e0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf621a5c-ebe7-4fce-ab25-2cd9494e7e16.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"f4337b0a-ae55-4ff6-b184-8769a9939908.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"75b10509-bf0f-4014-ad32-6da9a74d8765.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2ad4b515-68d3-4fab-9ec0-b011fdf3368a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5d93a367-926d-4d41-975d-90fdb0fb9a24.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"42628ac9-de87-48ef-8f02-1a561771c286.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"005c8666-8490-4eac-9d05-56c9e9499712.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ed5eadc9-fddc-402d-84bd-2cf0ffed96b5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kind Gal's","Overview":"Figure your way to the heart of either Ryoko, Maiko, Reiko or Akabe.","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1989},"93289":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Imagineer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5dea062e-83ed-4e4a-8447-2bec92f7aeb1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"7a62f129-f99d-4b26-b144-fac217e6ec12.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"47c3ebcc-639d-44fa-b4a2-dd851f4a4233.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ded1cb20-aaee-49c2-b444-f92d4aba4796.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"67457af5-75f7-4636-b35b-81cee53a6c3e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0dbc7b94-2d44-4b52-af30-b76111a9dd44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3c741f30-eaac-4466-99d2-5e1b5c762cd4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"42ee8c01-12cc-47b3-be56-c5362cbef18f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3bc53b73-1a21-4e6c-a237-61a5cc61fb00.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kieta Princess","Overview":"Princess Kilala, from the Kingdom of Rabia, has been summoned to Japan to have a discussion about a medicine that has been imported from her country that has been causing dementia to the Japanese public.

The game also features a day-night cycle which can have an effect on who the player runs into while exploring. \n\nSome parts of the investigation will lead the player to play a side-scrolling action platformer.

While collecting hearts, the player may stand on the same square up to three times - after which the square disappears. These pitfalls will instantly end the game if the knight lands on them, but at the same time are the only way to score points: Collecting the heart will repair any holes and award points for each one, after which the heart moves to a new space and the game continues. The knight is always moving towards the spot indicated by the player (or to a random default square if the player hasn't acted) and will continue to move faster as the game progresses. This makes it less easy to plan out moves ahead of time and, eventually, difficult to aim the knight in the desired direction before the next move occurs.\n\nThere is also a harder mode: Type B. In this mode the player must collect numerous hearts before the board's gaps are repaired and each heart has a timer: this is the number of moves the knight can make before the heart vanishes and a new one appears elsewhere.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xOu4A9l6Wh4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knight_Move"},"93291":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"69e19ef2-5312-45c6-a7f5-f30d8bb5e177.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1988447d-3992-4bf9-b722-f7bf81d9be4f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a03388b-97c8-43b8-8491-fd8d88ce198d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"265b22aa-a830-43fe-8e76-5dc19c15b713.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8fa3b7b4-36d0-45f7-8d7d-b5f5d91bbfa5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e4d4df02-294f-4745-9810-31e292ea1e5e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7577fbbd-39bd-4bea-9510-b1915cca4235.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"14f478d8-12ad-4bd2-9d36-c0b5c806fd61.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Mahjong","Overview":"Mahjong is a classic Chinese game available in many different variations. Being a Japanese game, Mahjong for the Nintendo Famicom unsurprisingly\nrevolves around the Japanese version of the game, also known as \"Reach Mahjong\" While originally a game for 4 players, Nintendo for some reason turned it into a two-player game when they released it for their console. This obviously has it's effect on the rules.\n\nThe object of Mahjong is to form a complete hand of tiles before your opponent does so, and before the stack of tiles is empty. The first player to complete a hand is then awarded a number of points depending on how good his hand was (these points are subtracted from your opponent's points. Originally, there were rules to determine which opponents you got these points from, and how many they each had to give up, but since this game only has two players, these rules obviously do not apply here) and the person with the most points after 8 rounds is declared the winner.\n\nThe game is played with small tiles in 5 different suits: Numbers, Circles, Bamboos, Winds and Dragons. The three first suits have 9 different tiles each,\nthe Wind suit has 4, and the Dragon suit has 3. Each individual tile is repeated 4 times, for a total of 136 total tiles.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1986-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qCjPf7RiAbU"},"93292":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hacker International","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"2ba493e5-5502-4e43-b463-bc33d9c05d90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d9e1b2f7-9599-4efc-bfb6-60cc7eb964ca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ab62b9ce-e583-4875-abca-74c901c0f9d7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"6caede99-2816-402a-a5dd-fd70d6ec4a35.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d100a41b-7cb5-4a38-b1f2-08ce823d663e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8e2f79de-dcb4-4eb6-9065-bafc82463012.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"de77cdba-46b6-4bbc-85db-5e52d04a055b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"284935a3-f11a-4bf9-b9f1-8f061c921194.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kobayashi Hitomi no Hold Up","Overview":"Kobayashi Hitomi no Hold Up is a puzzle game for adults developed and published by Hacker International for the Famicom Disk System.\n\nIn this solo game, you play a game of Hold Up with the beautiful model Kobayashi Hitomi.","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7SLRuHOnYeM"},"93293":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Nazoler Land: Daisangou","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Sunsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle; Quiz; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"094cdeef-4260-405f-aa89-f5623e0337cf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"b2c15d1d-e0e8-4da2-aa4c-8e4c2952532d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eb46c6ea-ddef-4c28-ad0e-152fe746c24f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28dd24d3-7345-4195-baec-d1500d0979df.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"3768cf9c-73c5-4617-a4f2-610f1a723f55.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fb72835d-60df-45f6-9f06-c78f3bdb5881.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"761a7339-70f7-4e1a-9c4b-d0f0db97e792.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"452281fd-5717-4a57-a768-fa6d676fd4f0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"9d893be2-eb43-4f61-b956-1dfa6770a406.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bec1f6b0-fba4-4b49-a923-e0e5d88c4824.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Nazoler Land: Dai 3 Gou","Overview":"Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou was the third and final \"Magazine Disk\" published by Sunsoft for the Famicom Disk System.

Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the \"game over\" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bv4d6MHDcio","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nakayama_Miho_no_Tokimeki_High_School"},"93303":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Boxxle: Warehouse Evening of Tears Special"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Thinking Rabbit","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"fc94e204-8169-4c06-8982-c5148418c17a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"cf38d3c1-4088-4fab-a4ef-4a9abbe11d4e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f71eb9bf-8030-4b8d-8c93-3a75ae29b848.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9e289b15-aa06-411d-a23e-2b061d89257c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b21b41e-2b9b-44bf-8599-5a6cbcd84808.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"3f8ac31c-3c25-4617-967f-e998cfa0f145.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9f0a70fd-2751-4cfe-8dd0-bf816d655398.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"60bb5165-ef44-4f7d-ad39-71500b1b1811.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c69a4fed-f7e4-487d-a00f-df95be45d14e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1621d24e-9df0-442e-b8d6-b4e5a0ab672e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Namida no Soukoban Special","Overview":"Namida no Soukoban Special (which roughly translates into Warehouse Keeper's Tears Special) is a game that was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 by ASCII Entertainment.

Rather than publish yet another version of the same old game, ASCII attempted to enhance the Soukoban experience for its debut on the Famicom by providing players with a unique set of tools that let players \"cheat\" in some fashion in comparison to the original rules. Objects like Magnets and Pulleys provided players with a limited ability to pull boxes, something which the original versions of the game prohibited. Objects such as these, or pepper, or oil, were discovered by pushing certain boxes that hid the items underneath.

Should a metal ball find its way to one of these compartments, the player will receive points that are similar to credits on a slot machine.[3] Players can expect to lose that ball (and a point) if it falls below the bottom of the board (similar to falling down a bottomless pit in an action game). Initially, the player starts off with one hundred balls (points).\n\nIn Mode A, the clock goes forward from 000000 seconds until it reaches 999999 seconds (the equivalent of either 16666.65 non-real time minutes, 2777.775 non-real time hours, or 115.740625 non-real time days). Once that occurs, the game is over and any remaining points are stored in the top three score list. Mode B is the same except that the clock goes backwards from 999999 seconds all the way back to 000000 seconds. It is very easy to mash the \"A\" button repeatedly around with the direction pad to the right in order to accumulate mass winnings from the pachinko games and \"cheat\" the system.\n\nThere is a hidden angry rant message that can be found in any hex editor. Almost five percent of the entire ROM (2.05 kilobytes out of the 41 kilobyte ROM image) is taken up by this otherwise inaccessible message. The message is recorded in romaji. It was removed in the Famicom Disk System version.","Publisher":"Toshiba EMI","ReleaseDate":"1988-10-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zPkG7eCup5s","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pachicom"},"93322":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!"},{"AlternateName":"Patlabor: The Mobile Police: Daini Shoutai Shutsudou seyo!","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"3744209b-25ec-49bf-8fe1-7f7e065d0d01.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f3942bb-910d-440a-9a16-2ce0b3c0c52e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bfa94ca5-9dcc-49ac-b3c8-6588eb4bc848.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"b961a8fe-a446-443d-80b0-5ebd201bc400.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e1018f5a-5920-4195-a0b8-5bd83f805fda.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"539b1eee-1a95-4329-b244-f86603ee83ed.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5febd296-df88-49cb-b5ac-04deed07c160.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f3805c2a-3f1e-4ded-a240-7206fe4ccc0c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8178df3e-92d8-47a1-abcd-ae4486332a02.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Patlabor: The Mobile Police: Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!","Overview":"Patlabor: The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo! is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant.

Pro Wres was also notable for being among the first wrestling games to feature unique wrestler movesets, with each grappler featuring at least one signature manuever.\n\nPro Wres roster includes seven wrestlers, with six playable and one boss character. Normal single player gameplay consists of playing a series of five matches before confronting the V.W.A. champion, King Slender, in a title match. However, when playing as Slender, Great Panther serves as the champion boss. Upon winning the title, the second stage of gameplay consists of defending the title ten times before facing V.W.F. champion Great Puma in an interpromotional match to crown the undisputed wrestling champion and end the game. Two player gameplay consists of one-on-one matches, each being the best of three falls.\n\nPro Wres is notable for introducing the world to the famously mistranslated \"A WINNER IS YOU\" after each victory.

They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.\n\nReplicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.\n\nThe conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage.

It was developed and published by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System. Two different versions were released within two months of one another. The initial version was sold in stores for ¥3,300 at the end of 1987 on its own disk with a case. The second version was sold for a much cheaper ¥500 in the beginning of 1988 as part of the \"Disk Writer\" system, where players could bring their own blank disks to a kiosk and have a game of their choice written to the disk. While both versions contain 10 maps to play on, the Disk Writer edition replaces five of the maps from the original edition with new designs. \"Gachapon Senshi\" means toy capsule warrior, as the gachapon toy capsule was a popular format for fans of the series to buy super-deformed versions of their favorite Gundam characters.\n\nWhile the game is considered memorable, especially for being the first in a long line of SD Gundam World games to come, the single-player experience is known for having considerable flaws and a high level of difficulty. While one could forgive the long load times common among the Famicom Disk System games, it was much harder to overlook the exaggeratedly long periods of time that the computer AI took to plan out its moves.

Other typical items like health refills, ranged weapons, teleport items and a handful of special items that are needed to progress the story, are also incorporated into the game.\n\nIn addition to a normal health bar, which gets reduced when the player comes in contact with enemies, there has to be paid attention to an extra counter that works as a sort of time-limit because it gets lower even when the player doesn't move or does anything at all. When killed, enemies might leave an item behind that increases the counter as well as the chance for a money increase. Money is used to buy stuff from shops which can be found scattered throughout the areas.","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1987-05-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jyVCfcesMfs"},"93539":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Super Pig","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"57343ee3-7d03-4f08-8a2f-52eec4d1bfbb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"148e267d-3b1b-4d42-be56-9faed702dd44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"280d8026-16e6-4310-811b-d4d25f891e10.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ca52805b-1793-4953-bfce-1fa8537c6330.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1c109252-93a3-4dad-b027-649224696be6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44f2616c-8a23-4cf9-813c-b07fffaa3ebd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sexy Invaders","Overview":"An adult version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders which upon beating levels you get to see various girls undress.","Publisher":"Super Pig","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Upv7VBNnSQIAFQjCNHrkGlMZXTJYEjW8FGyDHXIno7mrg&amp;sig2=GRdiovTe318zpQcXl54DrA"},"93541":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Yakyuuken Part II - Gal's Dungeon","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Yakyuuken Part II: Gal's Dungeon"},{"AlternateName":"Yakyuuken Part II: Gal's Dungeon"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Super Pig","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d0db3b17-9184-4bf1-9351-bd6aa0d5e1b0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ea916bfa-6b16-4187-bed8-9212f7329c9a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"41ded1a1-3cce-4c27-8c29-1be20340047b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"4644edea-1e77-447e-90bb-0aa49736b1ef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2b29c9a1-7c39-45eb-9bea-fac43751fc78.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"85234321-3025-4019-a47d-a25f395d0ea8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e06dad53-e55f-4829-aa6c-6caf4df5454b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3c8be66c-f6b5-425b-8aa9-8df6e49ae7fa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sexy Yakyuuken Adventure II: Gal's Dungeon Part","Overview":"Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig.\n\nYou play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious \"Phantom of 40 Faces\".

The player sees no other on-screen representation of themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the choice of forehand or backhand. \n\nThe Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side. The conversion offers several variations of play, including one or two player games, plays to 11 or 21 points, and five levels of difficulty.

The game is mostly presented in the first person, with the exception of Shinjuku Central Park itself, which is explored in a third-person overhead view roughly based on the actual layout of the real-life park.","Publisher":"Data East","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jake_Hunter"},"93600":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Intelligent Systems","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"4d13dab1-fc4f-4479-bb36-a3d8b6148607.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b6779fc5-5053-4ae0-ac09-8ee33cbecfcf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ebea2326-8565-455b-82eb-ff04b199fb90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e6c7e562-87fd-4501-a9a2-39e7dbaad991.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b72c8461-135c-402d-92be-5cd2b20f221a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"769dc2a2-1ea5-464c-b4f3-bb6dffd5f02f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c7d86d5d-4ddb-4a6c-8d53-145f6ca1f109.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tennis","Overview":"The game features single-player and two-player modes for singles and doubles matches, with either competitive or cooperative gameplay.

This game is the first Famicom game dealing with Ultraman.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent as Hayate, a raygun-sporting agent of the Science Special Search Party, an organization founded to defend the Earth from alien threats. He is limited to a short jump and his raygun, though both tend to be sufficient for taking care of smaller enemies and other minor obstacles.\n\nShould Hayate collect enough power from fallen enemies (and from the environment), he is able to transform into Ultraman: A building-sized robotic fighter with a range of special powers. However, Hayate can only stay as Ultraman for three minutes, and all of Ultraman's powers save his basic fighting moves can only be used once per transformation. At the end of each stage (and occasionally partway through) there is a different kaiju from the TV show that Hayate needs to defeat. It is highly recommended that the player find a way to transform into Ultraman if they wish to defeat these larger foes.\n\nIf all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-29T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OhNpeq_Ulro"},"93674":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Tenshi Tachi no Houkago","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mimi Pro","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1c82d67a-b760-41ba-be84-102799b635ed.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a485dbcd-a07d-49d5-8b5b-1338d51cd2a8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a3a81d5-88c6-412e-91e7-6874b2b567be.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5f6e1249-2e6b-47c1-9fdb-acd3df11236b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"81a8c319-6d92-4f6f-83e3-caf0a0b392f5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2d95499f-6767-4597-ade9-3216e2fab0e6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tenshitachi no Houkago","Overview":"An adult text adventure Famicom Disk System game.","Publisher":"Mimi Pro","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1989},"93692":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hacker International","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b390007b-12ed-4cc0-847f-34836e1fc0ce.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"03a94904-0357-442c-a0c9-6f810c33ec4a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"c923f2cf-3e1e-4450-8891-ddcf64411007.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"37b22240-d462-427c-b3c5-c262fdd362d8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4a0ad3cc-646e-4f05-9d81-5f93b056d69d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3f59b0c3-598a-452d-a295-02d902ea472c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bc8db581-5a23-43ba-91cd-90531d90bc00.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Golf: Bishoujo Classic","Overview":"An adult game in which you play golf, upon doing well enough you will see various girls undress.","Publisher":"Hacker International","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CNOwCZxhtVs"},"93739":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1890a0d3-406a-4c46-be17-b32c4d6d9804.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"122bd210-4f73-46c4-afe9-bbdc2a9911ac.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"400e7fbf-5ca1-4869-b8e9-8963f18f8fa2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"b2a69def-43dd-4e73-a3cc-79021a51d765.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5ec5c339-4235-4676-ac5f-2089583dd089.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b627b924-7009-44cb-ab3c-e7d4d825e765.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d1287327-ac9c-4f95-b102-351b79ae7867.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"49d50ef3-5b85-4c5c-8ea2-f1d10143607f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"933b44cc-023f-4109-ba89-d9e8ae2903b4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai","Overview":"Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai!!

When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.\n\nA valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.\n\nIshido comes with 6 differently themed stone sets, 5 different game boards, and a variety of Oriental chimes and sound effects.","Publisher":"Hiro","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ishido:_The_Way_of_Stones"},"99938":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Interlink","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"a8aa88b1-c08b-4ee6-aa21-ff56dfaddef2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"882ed7c7-1c05-4e4d-a52c-f130ba01fbf2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d06adf4c-5152-41e8-91dc-c6b661378cde.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"4e2999e1-57f5-4b1d-9639-b69988441d4e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e537e967-d48b-40a7-bab3-fb1a15f4d673.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a3e86fce-bc03-4fc3-936f-ea9c8070b034.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"76967c84-eea1-41e6-b228-ea2336cc54ef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ce9da46e-aa82-425e-aa33-fc4234fef839.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"efb24acf-34ca-4c71-8f06-edc05be86acb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen","Overview":"Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen (\"Earth Protection Strategy\" roughly) is a Bandai licensed game and the third Famicom Disk System game to be based on the Ultraman tokusatsu\/kaiju TV show.

(lit. Return of Mario Bros.) is an updated remake of the original NES conversion of Mario Bros, developed and published by Nintendo for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. While the original NES conversion, developed in 1983, was quite accurate to the arcade version upon which it was based, many compromises were made in order to fit the game in a limited amount of memory. These compromises included the size of the enemies, the instruction cut-scenes which introduced each enemy, and the icicles which form from the top platform later on in the game. Kaettekita Mario Bros. seeks to restore all of those aspects to as close to the arcade version as possible.\n\nKaettekita Mario Bros. was one of the few Famicom Disk System games available exclusively from the Famicom Disk Writer and not sold separately. In addition to the graphics improvements, Mario and Luigi gained the ability to change direction slightly in mid-air, and the game took advantage of its disk format by letting you register your name and save the top five high scores. In 1993, this version of the game was stripped of all of it's sponsorship content, and any contest information, and released in Europe simply as Mario Bros. (but with the label of \"Classic Series\"). This conversion of the game never made it to North America.\n\nIn an unusual move for Nintendo, this game was published in a partnership with a sponsor; Nagatanien, a Japanese producer of seasonings for rice and noodle dishes. As such, the game features in-game advertisements for Nagatanien products, as well as Super Mario Bros. 3, which was released one month prior. The game also featured a contest where players can win Super Mario Bros. 3 merchandise. Mario had also previously appeared on Nagatanien Japanese TV commercials.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1988-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wb55zig4EVg"},"100066":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Kattobi!

On top of that, the mugshots for the wanted posters originally had an Anime look, whereas in the NES version, they had a realistic look.\n\nIn this version, the shopping music features less instruments. Also, many of the tunes featured in the NES version are nowhere to be found in this version, and instead recycle the same music for certain scenes in the game. This is due to the limited memory space in FDS disk cards.\n\nThere is no game demonstration like there is in the NES version.\n\nAfter beating the game the first two times, the player is rewarded with a Japanese message that tells the player to try the game again. After the third time, the player will be rewarded with a simple message that says \"THE END\".

Rescue Princess Niketa and save the land of Vegitafruit from this insect invasion.\n\nKick Challenger utilizes a novel movement system. Each foot must be maneuvered and placed, one foot at a time, in a system that mimics actual upright walking. Kicks can be fired off in eight directions using whichever foot isn't currently planted. Levels are tailored specifically for this movement style, and simulate hills, narrow pipes, and other hazards that require you to be mindful of where you're planting those tootsies.\n\nPower-ups can be found by kicking the various fauna and bric-a-brac that fill the game's levels. These take the form of shoes that increase the tomato's stride or allow the player to walk on certain surfaces, or various items that give the player temporary abilities. Levels follow a linear upwards progression with no way to retreat backwards except by going through trap doors. In order to progress, the player must find their way through the maze-like levels and defeat the boss waiting at the end of them.","Publisher":"Vap","ReleaseDate":"1987-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iNh76SO1Jiw"},"100605":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Kineko Vol. II - Kinetic Connection - The Monitor Puzzle","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Kineco II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tamtex","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"a02f2213-b120-4b60-bbc5-7b50c75054fc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0abe01cc-d181-4274-8bb1-df5eefae49f6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"5fed6525-d1d7-45c8-b81d-625319bbe86e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"910a4d6c-0257-4bed-bb30-3480e358a13d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc7751c4-b084-40cc-beff-a6fa512a17d5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bdcc776b-4890-4dbc-80e2-2ab99a50a94a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cd642712-30be-4069-8b0a-ac3edb331e6e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f3dacc32-7d77-4cd7-85b9-03970d55775c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Monitor Puzzle Kineko: Kinetic Connection II","Overview":"A Disk Writer only release, The Monitor Puzzle Kinetic Connection: Kineco II is the sequel in which new puzzles are introduced.

Additionally, a 2-players co-operative mode was introduced as well, allowing two players to play simultaneously (with Player 1 in blue and Player 2 in red). The play mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, however the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remained) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The FDS version also features two additional stages that were not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base in which the player must disarm a nuclear missile at the end that is about to be launched; by using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit.\n\nThe FDS version features a few differences from its NES counterpart by allowing the player to continue up to three times after a game over and if the player loses a life in the Famicom version, his character will respawn at the very spot where he died instead of being sent to the last checkpoint (in the NES version, instant respawns are only allowed in the 2-Players game). Moreover, the player can carry up to nine rounds of any secondary weapon he finds instead of just three. To rebalance the difficulty, the NES version gives the player more extra lives when they begin (four instead of two) and all weapons dropped by enemies will always have three rounds in them instead of having the player accumulate them one by one. The Famicom version also features hidden underground areas which the player could access by destroying certain land mines in Stage 2, 4, and 5.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3S0vB0Wxd4c","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rush%27n_Attack"},"100693":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Cursed Treasure of Cleopatra, The","Region":"World"},{"AlternateName":"Cleopatra no Mahō","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"4c7d0b01-6bde-415d-8253-20ba404ca65c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"26513d05-2f5d-4b83-a27c-18bcfbcd9932.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01dfc595-44b3-4ecd-8b0f-d6b54aec9b15.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"e6f6d57f-97b2-4d74-a050-ccdfed8c7e81.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"55de69f8-deef-4746-84e3-42c54d3b0fdf.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11ce1acb-127a-405b-a982-21f9a712b4f0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a7a05310-49ff-41e3-876e-46d06a56f5f2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"439168ba-094e-488c-8011-b845ccfed434.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7e3da3b7-1dc8-4102-9603-40b462b7c510.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cleopatra no Mahou","Overview":"Players explore an Egyptian town and ruins from a first-person perspective.

Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the \"Konamic\" appellation; a portmanteau of \"Konami\" and \"dynamic\". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.\n\nKonamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.\n\nOne feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-08-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"100696":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Marionette","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"25fcde4a-20e9-4439-b4e2-94675db445b8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7bbdfaee-3c2b-4eff-be15-7529f3108568.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"875d647d-eb30-4cfe-a6b3-4164635c1c7f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"567687e3-05ee-4b55-967d-9e9b292469ea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"97fec8e0-1135-49a7-a82c-19a394428e56.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd39afca-edab-4746-ad0a-d65a2447df7d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ed274afc-7bbf-456d-b93c-99b104c8fbd7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d8f0e030-e503-4f37-92c2-4311b53e942f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8d5624d0-8b91-4b22-8903-cfad280ef6b2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran","Overview":"This game is inspired by the Japanese movie Koneko Monogatari (known in the west as The Adventures of Milo and Otis).

Every two stages counts as a month of time, with one stage counting as daytime and the other as nighttime. The main goal of each stage is to dodge enemies and get to end of the stage unhurt and within the time limit. Although Chatran cannot directly attack enemies, he's not totally defenseless. He can drop any eggs that he has picked up onto his enemies to dispose of them. Chatran can find these eggs plus other items like fruit by jumping into tree leaves thus shaking the items loose. Collecting 50 pieces of fruit will earn Chatran an extra life. There are also eggs that contain letters on them. Spelling out the word HELP will summon Chatran's canine companion Poosky, who can defeat any enemies that gets in his way.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1986-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HucMTisD5wc"},"101265":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"87ac6675-573d-49e2-aa7c-9f40f7fe7b26.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"4a7cc118-b4f5-463f-aa32-32c29a536a56.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d06d03cb-c937-427f-918e-e50bd2cd606d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1a21ca7a-564b-4b95-851f-f28aceb1cedc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"18903e57-c9de-4483-9bc6-edf823993845.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15af3b69-451a-43ad-9f14-343c7b9f78ba.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fdfedb5d-934b-405d-b100-c77cbb00c5a5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"08e2a9f3-2deb-4ffd-a47d-273965d4e6a4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Goonies","Overview":"The Goonies is based on a movie of the same name from 1985.

Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, Bubbles can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost when Bubbles falls into a Black Hole, or when time runs out. The game ends if Bubbles has lost all her lives.\n\nIn later levels, the player must pass over the ingots an odd number of times to uncover them, as they will alternate between their uncovered side and a dull side.\n\nThe Famicom Disk version is based on Vs. Clu Clu Land which was released for the coin-op Nintendo Vs. System. It contained twice as many puzzles, a new enemy (Boss Unira), different level themes, and some other adjusted game features.\n\nThis is the last licensed game that was released for the Famicom Disk System.

The goal is simple: to kill all the enemies on the round. There are two types of enemies; Pookas (the round red monsters with goggles) only have the power to kill a player by touching him, but Fygars (the dragons) have the power to kill a player either by touching him or horizontally breathing fire to burn him.\n\n\n\nIn this game, Taizo Hori (the player's character) is armed with two weapons. One is the pump from the original Dig Dug, which is used to inflate enemies until they bust. The other is a jackhammer, which can be used at \"fault lines\" on the map to create faults in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reach the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean, killing all creatures on it, including Taizo himself. The points earned from this depend on how many enemies are killed at once. Once three pieces of land have been cut off an island, a bonus vegetable will appear somewhere on what remains of the island, which can be eaten for extra points.

The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect.\n\nPower-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.","Publisher":"Bothtec","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"102450":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"38d562d9-e434-46b3-8241-d79011ead00b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1c0291c5-cd2c-409c-ad9b-8adfe1c4a944.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"165d9691-4653-42bb-9fe2-6a8bc46d9b0f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0c715053-7553-426e-8dcc-4b7919bf82a1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"d411bb00-798f-4e1f-b80f-68be2910f350.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a882a353-96cc-4763-8293-a34244c07307.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"03c16ed4-2cbb-4e96-968e-34cf60593a88.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5a252b72-3b9e-43ba-950a-c1ea137344c5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b751da46-ce6a-442f-994a-a497c82fc6bd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Akumajou Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin","Overview":"The game's setting takes place seven years after the original Castlevania. The prologue begins when Simon visits his family's resting ground. His back is critically injured from his last encounter with Dracula in the previous game. He suddenly feels someone's presence, and turns to see a young woman standing within the mist. She tells him that a curse was placed upon him by Dracula during their last battle, and that he does not have long to live. The woman continues to say that the curse can be undone if he resurrects Dracula himself. She further explains that Dracula's body was split into five different parts after his defeat seven years ago, and Simon must recover these and bring them to the ruins of Dracula's castle. There, he must seal Dracula and defeat him. Before disappearing, the unknown woman says she cannot guarantee that this will destroy Dracula permanently.\n\nDracula II - Noroi no Fuuin (Lit. \"Dracula II: The Seal of the Curse\") is an action-adventure game produced by Konami. It was originally released for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan in 1987, and for the NES in North America in 1988. It is the second Castlevania title released for the NES, following the original Castlevania. Set in 1698, seven years after the events of the first installment, the player once again assumes the role of vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is on a journey to undo a curse placed on him by Dracula at the end of their previous encounter. Small differences exist between the Japanese version and the American version. Specifically the Japanese version takes advantage of the expanded FM processing capabilities of the FDS hardware to produce better sound, but it contains load scenes when entering or exiting any town or mansion. The FDS version also has three save slots instead of the NES password system.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yZrqoLqBpx0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castlevania_II:_Simon%27s_Quest"},"102451":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Takara","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"f21ed401-2247-4d46-b1b7-b3b03ab5d54c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"adb308fa-20c3-4cfe-9401-cff0abe492a0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"68969d80-228d-443d-8cae-cd7b5477d9e6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"f77f9579-9b52-4394-a468-1e8101483e2a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0dd9c381-0dd1-4ecf-a967-cddd650a763f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9ec0d28d-9fb0-4e7a-9328-0117d9468915.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2c5ddc0c-cf00-4a45-b810-58adb1060abd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e1e9b937-f4be-496a-b70d-8a391c9b774a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Transformers: The Headmasters","Overview":"Transformers: The Headmasters is a 1987 Family Computer Disk System game by Takara based on the popular cartoon series of the same name and released only in Japan.

A construction set is included, allowing players to create and play their own buildings.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1989-02-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9gtGg9Bhv9c","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wrecking_Crew_(video_game)"},"103341":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clocks","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tokuma Shoten","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"632c60e6-8fbe-44ef-b131-c5364ca4e4b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"62d6959d-3a40-477c-9de9-8c246ada09ac.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"99739733-4517-4463-bac0-3344352e3934.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d1e6d26d-3b78-43a0-a987-63092d9262fe.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d6468705-64c4-4f75-9776-ce2d6721c861.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b7c95ca-d610-4698-901d-a1d732d75f65.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"268a3435-f5dc-4365-9458-6075650fdc03.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d5bcb6a7-55ef-4a57-bf89-51b101d3f40e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clox","Overview":"Clox, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 4: Clox, is a falling blocks puzzle game that is superficially similar to Tetris or Columns. Single clock faces depicting one of four angles fall from the top and the player needs to manipulate and place them so they can form larger objects, such as simple formations like squares, diamonds and hourglass shapes to more object-intensive shapes like octagons and hexagons.\n\nThe four angles include 180 degree lines (\"12:30\"), 90 degree lines (\"12:15\"), 135 degree lines (\"~12:22\") and 45 degree lines (\"~12:07\"). Once a clock face is placed, the lines from it extend to connect to any other lines that surround it. Placing lines in such a way that it forms a shape - for example, placing four 90 degree clocks in such a way to form a square - earns the player points and removes the clocks used to form the shape. Larger shapes are more risky but earn more points.\n\nThe player is given some leeway to recover from mistakes: should the player hold the down button to make a clock fall faster, it'll destroy any clocks underneath. A misplacement, therefore, can be rectified with a correctly positioned clock if it falls quickly enough to crush the offending clock. However, the player can only do this a limited number of times per stage.","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"103509":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data East","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3c0b334b-9f3c-467f-809f-0640611afa05.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"a03f0036-7c1d-4ea9-bd55-ae1a4993119c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"b2ce2b62-92d8-43ff-a684-fde69ecc29fa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"76b4acbe-2a60-4fc0-bac0-b33a7adb0da3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"59f798a8-ac5d-44de-bdd0-7a916adcbdbe.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f1c1ddc-af7e-467e-a8e6-b35229b1ed9b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"873ba027-a334-41c1-826b-4cfc7df01997.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e80072ec-4d6a-4479-88af-d38a98a3126c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"BurgerTime","Overview":"The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods.\n\nWhen main protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, the player's character, walks the length of an ingredient (bun, meat patty, tomato, etc.), it falls one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the game level is finished.\n\nWhile making burgers, the player must avoid the antagonists, three types of enemies: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, stunned, crushed with a falling ingredient, or dropped by luring them onto an ingredient and then causing it to fall. In this last case, the piece will fall two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Enemies that have been crushed or dropped return to the maze after a few seconds. Dropped enemies award larger point values than crushed ones; therefore, to obtain a high score, the player must attract more than one enemy onto an ingredient just before dropping it.\n\nPeter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.\n\nThere are six screens of increasing difficulty, with more burgers and enemies, burgers that have more parts, and\/or layouts that make it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach the ingredients. Completing all six screens takes the player back to the first one.","Publisher":"Data East","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BurgerTime"},"103511":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Carry Lab","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"1ba852a5-c131-4208-815f-4335e9b2cca4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"332f1a81-d2c4-440f-9aac-a516f8ce98df.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a01bf0be-d40b-4111-887a-33d1a3db41c4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"1b9f0011-318b-4627-99d4-d803be9960c5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4fae9366-943d-4a23-92e0-7b1db648a9b6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"60018a07-15cb-4878-a89f-9a1cd4c20209.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b0cf2f95-3488-4c17-b36c-ea9b48aabd39.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"63b03a44-bf9b-4a1b-8739-ce8a7537c1dc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"89c5e520-22eb-4924-b1a0-bb032c1c211c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hao-kun no Fushigi na Tabi","Overview":"Once there lived a sorcerer's apprentice named Hao who, day after day, did every thankless task the Great Wizard asked him to do.

When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, he loses a life. Whenever Pac-Man occupies the same tile as an enemy, he is considered to have collided with that ghost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. \n\nNear the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LDNqe6pVf24","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pac-Man"},"103520":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pack-In Video","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"f77cc774-ac76-4c79-b4ba-a0c5b21bd60f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c4863bc7-336c-4978-8d3d-93c8b6955835.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bd6916c1-e1a3-4ea9-b2e2-8aaf67fd107e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"f65520b0-a909-422d-9790-3779408d93a5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"23d0dec2-e638-4f51-b87c-53e075ba6578.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e2a2c4cf-4646-48ee-a268-63239a3c84b2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"16c7a6c2-03e5-49ae-9932-f79e70e28e41.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2b709460-ac6a-4315-bfba-37b25e3958f8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Putt Putt Golf","Overview":"Putt Putt Golf by Pack-In-Video is one of many golf games for the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System, but one of the few to take players through an abstract world rather than an approximation of a real golf course.

The game has two screens to represent the traditional pinball table and one for a bonus mode. Play begins when the player launches a ball with the plunger from the first screen—the bottom of the pinball table—through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. The player controls the flippers on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.\n\nPinball also has a secondary Breakout-like mode, which the player reaches by hitting the ball into a bonus hole that takes the player to a bonus stage where they control Mario carrying a platform. The object of this mode is to rescue Pauline (previously seen in Donkey Kong). The player achieves this by bouncing the ball off Mario's platform and hitting various targets, the destruction of which also earns them points. When the blocks under her are all gone, she will drop. Catching her on Mario's platform earns the player bonus points, but allowing her to hit the ground causes the player to lose.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1989-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W19WctyO18Y","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pinball_(video_game)"},"103530":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"6327e063-121e-431f-9d2f-67542d930624.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"613e3b99-e078-4a80-8cd6-98c5e0a0b213.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c49cf0fa-86ab-47a9-879c-87ef1fe81672.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3d33248-efe7-4276-b77b-e7c521a700ea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"57510747-10f6-4a4c-a32c-ba797fc957cc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e38767ca-4c9d-41fc-b4f4-6a74f5b95fdd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"98b4bf86-6944-4e5b-87ba-10c59476e82f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"66cf4be6-27af-45dc-a228-2d13a0daf57c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3b245b1d-a954-41d4-90f3-1c247627640a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"871aa2b2-93c0-4a56-80be-d07117d81c87.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Final Command: Akai Yousai","Overview":"This earlier version of the game we known as Jackal in the west lacks some of the content that were later added to its NES counterpart, due to the fact that it was released in disk card format rather than on a ROM cartridge.

In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the \"scissors\" gesture, the \"rock\" gesture or the \"paper\" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a \"strength\" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).\n\nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage.\n\nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King).\n\nJanken Disk Jou has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System.

One day, he learned of a rumor that stated if a robot could ever escape the labyrinth and reach the surface of the world, his wish would be granted and he would become human. Bomberman is determined to find out if this rumor is true.\n\nBased on an earlier MSX game of the same name, Hudson Soft dramatically improved the game for its Famicom release by adding a number of enemies, horizontally scrolling stages, and the power-ups that make keeping Bomberman alive so worthwhile. But they also made the first steps in shaping the Bomberman character that we know and recognize today. The sprite used for Bomberman actually came from an enemy sprite used in Hudson Soft's very successful Famicom conversion of Lode Runner. One of the robotic enemies that chased the Lode Runner hero learned that he might become human if he can climb fifty underground floors to escape from his plant and reach the surface of the world. The only weapon at Bomberman's disposal, of course, are bombs.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8svpsSoFoPY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bomberman"},"103538":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bits Laboratory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"de95cfe8-fd71-4e29-a19b-6f04a33b7fb3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd7946c1-7970-42d9-957f-18dae7ce65ff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e415b11-0759-423b-870f-5aace294ea22.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"45179dee-7e3d-4486-9d78-717cfbff4fd4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"79039690-15d1-4f65-ac15-65d82d8ed6e8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e3c4189a-62fc-41c5-a3fe-27e06c8ebda1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"074e9432-a0b8-4932-ab20-c6478cabd7ac.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bc41f2fb-31b5-468d-8ad8-dd44757eecee.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Magma Project: Hacker","Overview":"Magma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC\/Amiga\/Atari ST strategy game Hacker.

Like the game Fire Rock, it also prominently features the name of developer Mark Flint. It was released exclusively through the Famicom Disk System's \"Disk Writer\" service, where the player must write the game onto an existing FDS disk before playing it. This and Akuu Senki Raijin, released on the same day, would be the last games ever published through the DOG label, as Square decided to focus on cartridge releases for the Famicom after the success of Final Fantasy. No official disk label exists though ones were displayed in magazine ads that have been used.\n\nThe game starts out by depositing the pinball in the middle of a simulated pinball table. However, once the ball is shot into one of the holes on the play field, the game enters an elaborate intro sequence which the player can control. The game contains 11 stages, each of which contain a target hole that the player must hit the ball into in order to advance to the next stage. The stages get more elaborate, and more moving obstacles appear to interfere with the behavior of the ball. In addition to controlling the flippers, the control pad can also be used to \"nudge\" the ball in either direction, although the effectiveness of this varies.","Publisher":"Disk Original Group","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ctmefO_qjRI"},"103758":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"System Sacom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f64b8642-ae33-4bd9-b82e-6404496dde40.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92ec611f-9b3b-4c77-869f-a1f2502db955.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"edc6ce2d-7434-42ae-83b8-4fe2bfd65d2a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"1a9deacb-3775-4cad-9120-80f753889520.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d70bd08e-06e8-4165-bde6-ae7c593011d5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2dba4310-de23-4559-9cec-2035662aeade.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ef934000-5049-4ba0-98c7-ad2241a48ade.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"00800146-d834-4d55-b6d5-cf69ecd0e24e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fire Rock","Overview":"Fire Rock is an action platformer developed for the Famicom Disk System by System Sacom, and published in Japan by Use in 1988.

The game is commonly sited as having very poor controls, often requiring the player to grab hold of a wall, and very slowly climb it by holding up and tapping jump repeatedly.

You are given a choice of point-and-shoot, single lens reflex and a pro camera. In order to get a real photograph, you must evaluate the lighting situation and subject and choose the correct shutter speed, film speed, aperture and whether to use flash or not.\n\nThe choice of camera is also a choice of difficulty level. With a point-and-shoot, you need only get one variable right, whereas the pro camera requires you to set both aperture, shutter and film speed correctly.\n\nYou are only given a few chances per shoot to get the right exposure, or you will just see a miscoloured picture flash briefly. Judging the exposure correctly grants you a picture of the girl, often in a surprising state of undressing, whereafter you progress to even more erotic poses. Later stages raise the difficulty level, forcing you to use the SLR, and later the meter-less pro camera.","Publisher":"Phoenix","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1987},"168212":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mimi Pro","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"09998786-30b5-4d6d-807a-963fe24453bd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70ebbad5-24d1-4ee3-bb77-b3fceaa126b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cdd1f4a2-ffe2-4dc1-8088-8e18ae7fffe9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c1fbe4df-98b5-43df-8363-03a0cd3a134f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2fcee5e3-19bd-408c-b0f6-d95d8194a8c1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sailor Fuku Bishoujo Zukan Vol. 1","Overview":"Your mission is to climb up the ladders and reach the top where a girl waits for you, while avoiding various objects falling from above.

It was made by Waixing Computer Science & Technology. The game itself at first seems to be a regular turn based RPG. However, there are some notable differences. For one, there are no \"inns\" or anything similar in this game. Instead the characters regain health and magic after each fight automatically, to a certain extent. This is not a problem later on but becomes one towards the one of the game.\n\nAnother difference is that there is little to do in the game other then talking to people and fighting enemies. Despite not knowing Chinese one can force one's way through the game by simply fighting the boss characters visible on the screen and talking to people. There is little chance of not knowing where to go as you can only go into areas that you have to go to next. Otherwise the game simply notes the area as being somewhere you can go by displaying a name, but will not allow you to go inside, even if there is seemingly nothing preventing your entry. In addition, NPCs and defeated boss characters will not repeat dialogue that they've already said, so one can check quite easily if he missed a necessary conversation by simply attempting to talk to them again. There is little need to really know what they say in depth as the conversation usually amounts to an event flag which opens up a previously inaccessible area. \n\nOne notable thing about the game is that it is set on one map, which is however divided into three areas. Once the player gets teleported to the other side of the river, there is no way to go back to the starting area. It is at this point where the game becomes more imbalanced. There are two boss characters here, both of whom use an attack that hurts the entire party for 200 or 300 dammage respectively. Progress having been much smoother before, one has to start going around and grind the enemies in this area, far tougher then those in the first area. It's here that the auto healing function stops being much of an asset, as there is only a certain amount of health and magic that regenerates after a fight and if you keep running into the skeletons, you will probably keep on losing energy rather then getting any back.","Publisher":"Waixing","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1998,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vmnqhyarx-8"},"189208":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Super Pig","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"2c1a3491-d36a-4018-a50b-a8df25e92851.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7c53a4c-c450-4c5a-8b22-50fb42c7be4f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b33d7110-793a-4756-adc6-bafb11791046.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"92d75cda-86a1-4852-8d47-3cd183058b1f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sexy Yakyuuken Adventure II: Gal's Dungeon Part II","Publisher":"Super Pig","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","ReleaseYear":1994}}
