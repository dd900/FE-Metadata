It is also possible to alter history and qualify with a team that did not make it to the real world cup. There is a mode to become the captain of your country where an individual player goes through training and matches competing against other team members to become captain. Road to Rio de Janeiro allows players to compete in an online tournament across the 12 venues of the cup. There are various kill games and both offline and online multiplayer matches are supported. EA Talk Radio offers a selection of duos that provide commentary for matches.\n\nDespite extensive borrowing from FIFA 14, there are also a number of changes. There are for instance new and additional animations for the players and the crowds have various details and attributes that refer to the countries' teams and colours. The appearance of the real coaches has been simulated and the game often cuts away to scenes of fans celebrating at home. The defense AI has been made looser, making it easier to break through. It also has become much more viable to launch long distance shots as there is a much higher chance of scoring than usual, leading to more spectacular goals. The keepers however have received an ability boost and will prevent scores from getting out of hand. Penalties have been made easier to perform, but keepers have more options to distract the strikers. Scoring from corners has been made harder as defenders will now jump up and will prevent attackers from cutting in unobstructed. This also applies to crosses that are now more often intercepted and headers feel less overpowered compared to previous titles. Other gameplay changes affect dribbling, an increased accuracy in passing and first-touch mechanics. Overall, the game mechanics have been made more accessible.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167765,"FileName":"7e8638a0-7e42-48fd-8c0d-898d4aee28f7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167765,"FileName":"40b8f25c-6698-47e3-ba22-227dd4a8f241.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167765,"FileName":"1e6b9900-847f-4394-9c95-a720f5b43363.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167765,"FileName":"c5f37781-9a64-4e4a-86aa-b152d9e11b2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16147,"Name":"2K Sports Combo Pack: MLB 2K12/NBA 2K12","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The longest running Major League Baseball franchise returns with MLB 2K12 from 2K Sports.

In addition to missiles and a vulcan cannon, the player can equip special weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, bombs, rocket launchers, and others. The player can lock on to a number of foes, and assist different tactical squads by switching between their respective HUD readouts.\n\nThe game includes 4 default multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, Siege Battle, Team Battle, and Co-Op Battle. In Battle Royale, the basic Deathmatch game mode, up to sixteen players shoot each other down to earn the highest points at the time limit. In Team Battle, a basic Team Deathmatch game is created. Points are awarded based on the type of aircraft destroyed. A unique type of multiplayer game, Siege Battle is played with two teams, Attacking and Defending. The Attacking team attempts to destroy the target (usually heavily defended by flak) within the time limit. The Defending team tries to halt their attack. The co-op battle mode consists of two single-player missions without AI that can be played with up to three other players.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw5mEfiU38U","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"83a4736e-6fa0-4713-a41e-d26650944a38.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"037ff3cf-e28a-446c-8846-e7534b238eb1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"37f5a74d-70cf-40ed-ba9c-cbdaa64ace5f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"a7f0d60d-4b12-4d20-8aa5-f07a354edb2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"a7a624f2-a018-460e-87f7-1d8096b63485.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"634ea1b2-d227-43d9-adc3-20549cde11cd.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"00426561-ac06-440c-ad56-a0325608193b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"f284fc2e-4ff3-46ab-bba3-f974066c0778.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"e1d6abd2-3494-4315-90f9-e016b21d4dc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10,"FileName":"8c12ac3a-700e-4de0-8cf8-99d99eb626d5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12573,"Name":"Ace Combat: Assault Horizon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Developed by the Project Aces team, ACE COMBAT ASSAULT HORIZON intensifies the franchise, escalating combat to the next level with aircraft that are literally torn apart, spewing oil and debris across the sky.

Features include: upgradable melee weapons and magic abilities, a shattered game world filled with altered versions of Lewis Carroll's famous characters and intuitive and rewarding puzzle play. \n\nEleven years ago a horrific fire took Alice's family from her and left her mind horrifically scarred. Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge Asylum where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping slipping further into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her release - yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event.\n\nWith her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she'll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the \"real\" world can't provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge.

Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.\n\nEdward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram.\n\nThis is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out.\n\nFire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBhYNrA2g94","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Horror","Developer":"Eden Games S.A.S.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"2008-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"b875a7e0-d87f-4691-abd6-0f740a727ba8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"bc8e982e-1246-44fa-b6b4-7c51a3f8928c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"93660016-c15a-4f24-b4bf-70e5e508c9db.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"cf5f520e-29cd-48b5-903e-0ffd20e48963.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"a8e5d45a-4314-4c49-a01b-a0e39f72bc9c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"e3786373-8772-4670-8d2b-a4ade8e5fca8.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"c7db3b4c-7d39-43c0-ac6a-08b93067908b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"d0c2db44-abac-457b-904d-e395dec96f33.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"960e30ec-6fbc-4d0b-9064-ef22efc1eae1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"c2da2837-2a00-4639-b579-717506e48e60.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9066,"FileName":"048b5d8f-70c9-41d6-bf0a-eeb953c0169d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12277,"Name":"Alpha Protocol","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Billed as an \"espionage RPG,\" Alpha Protocol casts you in the role of secret agent Michael Thorton as he embarks on a series of international operations set in Rome, Moscow, Tai Pei, Saudi Arabia, and other exotic locales.

What sets Alpha Protocol apart from traditional action games is the level of customization you have over your character and the options you have while interacting with others.

Stealth-oriented spies can complete the entire game without killing an enemy, while destructive types can bring out the body armor and heavy artillery. Action points can be assigned to an assortment of attributes, from stealth and pistols to sabotage and technical aptitude, which all lead to different skills. Cash earned by completing missions can also be spent in multiple ways, from powerful weapons on the black market to hiring mercenaries to purchasing various gun modifications for improving stats in areas like damage, accuracy, recoil, stability, and ammunition capacity.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLfNdZTed4","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Obsidian Entertainment","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12277,"FileName":"b3972e51-67ce-4ed5-86b7-3db894a20928.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12277,"FileName":"6211bc79-0174-4b16-b16f-6b891e30bfa1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12277,"FileName":"44ca0ea7-bbba-4b1e-ad67-3f0705c2e3bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12277,"FileName":"e01ec8b8-5ae6-4ce0-b7fc-9d4108308e8a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12277,"FileName":"c1e7e2c6-10e7-4813-831f-971cc38b1efb.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12277,"FileName":"338662ba-8589-4433-a280-3fee9ada1d28.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14166,"Name":"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sing and dance as any of The Chipmunks and The Chipettes--Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor.

Once he recklessly agreed to deliver a strange amulet for a blind lady, and from that moment on, his soul became corrupted. Now all the former hero can think about is power and conquest - but not for long, as a new hero has risen somewhere else...\n\nArcaniA: Gothic 4 is the successor to Gothic 3 and based upon the stories of the previous games, but does not continue it. It is a single-player, role-playing game with a \"back-to-basics\" approach, and features which have been slimmed down.\n\nTaking place a decade later than the previous game, players take the role of a new hero whose motivation and goal is to destroy the forces who have massacred his loved ones.\n\nUnlike other Gothic series games, the world map here is much smaller. Although each location can be explored fully, once at a new location there is no going back to a previous area. The plot is linear. Through the series of quests, the storyline progresses as each objective is reached, eliminating guesswork. There are no guilds or factions to align with, and no in-game morality code so the player doesn't need to worry about being thrown in jail for opening the wrong chest, stealing an item or killing someone. In addition, the amount of inventory items that can be carried has no cap. \n\nThere are three main classes (mage, ranger and warrior), skill trees and levelling up as experience increases. Battles are action-based. Choose to fight with ranged or melee weapons, or cast one of the three types of spells (fire, lightning or ice). Spells increase in strength in alignment with the player's levels. Gather plants and minerals to create potions and other items using a simplified crafting system. Upgrades to armour and weapons can be purchased with the gold amassed from fallen foes or quest rewards.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbQKtVxWMpo","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2010-10-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8853,"FileName":"7167d858-f96e-4088-9d90-699c2d18e35a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8853,"FileName":"187b6fe3-e101-4cb1-bf3b-172fd01f5a82.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8853,"FileName":"4e235ca1-1331-4952-b4b8-d131d3f72473.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19946,"Name":"Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?

Additional features include: a range of unique enemies, planetary sized bosses, a second playable character, and a devastating attack system. \n\nLong ago in the realm of Shinkoku, eight deities known as \"The Eight Guardian Generals\" battled to protect civilization from a destructive force known only as Gohma.

In the middle of the commotion, Asura's wife was also murdered and his daughter kidnapped. With even his brother-in-law and rival Yasha turning against him, Asura was banished from Shinkoku. Awoken by a voice after 12,000 years, Asura vows revenge on all those who have betrayed him. \n\nWith unprecedented levels of dynamism, drama and interaction, Asura's Wrath delivers a fresh take on the action gaming genre. Combining intense combat with a seamless player-controlled narrative, Asura's Wrath introduces a brand new style of action game. Players will control Asura in a blend of action and cinematic sequences taking an active role in the gameplay direction. \n\nAsura's Wrath finds Asura facing off against numerous distinct enemies, including planetary sized bosses.

One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \"one of its silver linings\". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.\n\nBackbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch.

The Lord of the Games (aka LOG) is tired of the petty squabbling between Banjo and the evil witch Gruntilda (aka Grunty) over the years, and has arranged a showdown to decide the rightful owner of Spiral Mountain. Claiming to have created every video game ever made, LOG has built the game worlds in which the contest's challenges take place. Banjo must complete LOG's challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster. \n\nThroughout their adventure, players create their own abilities by building vehicles for Banjo to pilot over land, water, and air. Vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game.

The game begins as Batman delivers the Joker to Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. The villain springs a trap and takes over the institution, with an army of thugs and a host of dangerous inmates to back him up. The twisted plot plays out in a freely explored re-creation of the asylum and surrounding island. In addition to prowling the corridors of Arkham, Batman can explore the outdoor areas, using his equipment to reach high spots and glide safely back down.\n\nSpecially suited for the game's one-against-many melee style, the three-button combat control scheme is intended for free-flowing moves and strings of combo attacks on multiple opponents. Batman also has a belt full of useful gadgets to help even the odds, with x-ray scanners and chemical tracers that let him see through walls and follow invisible tracks. Stealthy prowling gives advantages of positioning and surprise, rewarding the hero's caution and patience with one-hit takedowns. Experience earned through combat, exploration, and experimentation allow Batman to create better equipment, more finely tuned to the given tasks.\n\nIn addition to the Joker and his brilliant aide in evil, Harley Quinn, Batman faces other super-powered asylum patients, including Bane, Killer Croc, and Zsasz. As usual, brains as well as brawn are required to unravel Joker's insanely inspired scheme. The story for Batman: Arkham Asylum was written by Paul Dini, writer and producer for Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond. Cartoon series regulars Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin perform voice acting. The game was developed by Rocksteady Studios, creator of Eidos' 2006 first-person shooter Urban Chaos: Riot Response.\n\nAlong with the full game and all features of the original release, the Game of the Year Edition of Arkam Asylum supports three-dimensional effects using the TriOviz-brand stereoscopic technology, and ships with two pair of special glasses for use with the game. The 3D technology can be used on any conventional television set or monitor and does not require any additional equipment. The GOTY re-release also ships with four extra Challenge Maps not included in the original editions of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Fighting; Stealth","Developer":"Rocksteady Studios","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

From a familiar third-person perspective, players resume the single-player role of Batman, for missions of infiltration, assault, recovery, and rescue. Gruesomely outnumbered, the hero's survival still relies largely on stealthy ninja tactics, although open environments occasionally call for cape-aided hang-gliding or grappling-hook acrobatics.\n\nAlthough the territory of the new Arkham City is nearly five times larger than the old asylum grounds, Batman's path is sometimes limited by outbursts of gang warfare, usually best avoided. The game also regularly presents puzzles for the Dark Knight to solve, in the gadget-enhanced \"Detective Mode.\" The combat system has been refined, allowing Batman to counter attacks from multiple opponents at once, and to access his gadgets in the middle of a fight.\n\nSet only a year after the events of Arkham Asylum, the game's story begins with Quincy Sharp, the former warden who is now mayor of Gotham City. His plan -- to shut down the asylum, move the inmates to a walled in section of city slums, and hire private security to guard the new borders -- has created a zone of pure lawlessness in the heart of Gotham. It is a city within a city, where inmates are free to roam the streets, stealing and killing as they wish, so long as they do not attempt to escape.\n\nControl of this urban wasteland is now contested by two rival gangs: one led by the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, and the other by Two Face, who has called for the public execution of Catwoman, much to the delight of the other bloodthirsty residents. Side-stories involve more of Arkham's most famously devious and demented recidivists, including Mr. Freeze, the Penguin, Poison Ivy, and the Riddler. Kevin Conroy again voices Batman, with Mark Hamill as the Joker.\n\nThis \"Game of the Year Edition\" offers Xbox 360 players the full original game, the newly released \"Harley Quinn's Revenge\" DLC, and a variety of other DLC packs, adding seven new maps, three playable characters, and 12 new skins in all.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Stealth","Developer":"Rocksteady Studios","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

Two single-player campaigns await the player with one picturing the Japanese starting at the attack on Pearl Harbor and the American campaign following the aftermath of the the Battle for Midway.\n\nSimilar to the Battlefield series the game puts the player right in the middle of the battle, always surrounded by AI-units filling up the free spots. But instead of fighting on foot, the players only use several different kinds of battleships, u-boats and airplanes. These are launched by the players at their team's HQ and can be equipped with different weapon load-outs. Depending e.g. on the type of the airplane (bomber, fighter or such), these range from MGs over rockets and bombs to carpet bombs and paratroopers. Of course once the support bar reaches zero, no more units can be launched.\n\nBesides players doing all the work while sitting in a unit, the commander can also use the tactical map to assign formations, give out orders to the AI as well as other players and so on. This is also the place where the players choose in which unit they want to jump in. Each type of unit also plays radically different. While airplanes concentrate on fast dogfights and low bomb-droppings, ships are slow but can repair themselves. U-Boats on the other hand have the ability to dive and disappear from every enemies radar. To compensate for that, U-Boats not only have a limited supply of oxygen but can also be spotted by sonar and killed with water-bombs.\n\nBesides the campaigns, the game also features five skirmish-modes for both single- and multiplayer. In \"Escort\" both teams have to defend key units from the enemy while themselves attacking and destroying the enemies key units with every player using a pre-defined unit. \"Siege\" on the other hand one team has to attack a island or coastline with the other team defending it. This time each player can choose his own unit from an available pool of units. \"Competition\" again has all the players only controlling one unit but fight on the same side in an effort to destroy as many AI-enemies as possible or completing the objectives. In \"Duel\" the players choose their unit before each mission and have to destroy all enemy units to win the round. And last but not least \"Island Conquest\" requires the capturing of control points to both win the match and gain access to additional units.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Eidos Hungary","Publisher":"Eidos","ReleaseDate":"2009-05-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14758,"FileName":"0c8f59c0-b2fb-4676-ae15-e57ff607eb34.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14758,"FileName":"5bf0c421-b01b-4e57-a073-6a3963ef4d8c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199969,"Name":"Battlezone","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The original tank vs. tank action classic Battlezone has received an Xbox LIVE overhaul, adding in exciting new multiplayer modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag.

It again follows the story of Ayumi but does not pick up on the events of the previous game. She is a female treasure hunter who disrupts a rite of a guild to access a sphere that transports her to the fantasy world Dragonland. She fights with a set of blades in over-the-top hack-and-slash gameplay reminiscent of the God of War series. Slashes and kicks are linked into fast combos including finishing moves when an enemy has been forced into a submissive position. She can also pick up a variety of long-ranged weapons such as rifles or a rocket launcher and these are also used to shoot objects that are out of reach to solve puzzles. During her journey she can pick up diary pages from previous treasure hunters that explain how chaos magic has altered the environment and introduced monsters. She also meets fellow treasure hunters along the way.\n\nAyumi regularly discovers altars where new skills are learned. This includes for instance the ability to freeze enemies or rise giant ice crystals below them. These can only be used when a rage bar is built up with up to three levels by defeating opponents. She is also able to dash away to evade attacks or quickly close the distance towards an opponent. In a menu Ayumi can equip the items and weapons she finds. There are four slots: close combat, ranged attacks, amulets, and rings. Previously found items are not dumped and it is possible to switch between items at any moment when a certain effect is needed such as additional fire damage. Certain items can be crafted by discovering a recipe and collecting the necessary ingredients. Time referenced in the title refers to the skill Ayumi eventually learns to rewind time and fight along with a clone of herself that performs the actions that were previously done. This self-cooperative element is a way to confuse enemies carrying shield and is also vital to solve some of the puzzles in the later parts of the game. There is no in-game map but a compass can be pulled out with a visual effect for the direction that should be followed. After defeating a boss character there is often a portal that leads to a new location.\n\nMultiplayer is available through the Outbreak mode with gameplay similar to Defense of the Ancients. It offers games where two teams attempt to defeat each other's energy tree while keeping their own alive. Between the two trees are outposts filled with computer-controlled minions and monsters. At the start of the game each player selects up to three abilities. The tree keeps regenerating energy until all outposts have been destroyed and it is enhanced by destroying enemy outposts and player-controlled heroes. Each outpost spawns characters that move towards the opponent and his outposts. By defeating heroes and outposts players earn additional respawns and open up further room for abilities. When all outposts have been destroyed respawns directly tap from the tree energy's source until eventually there is no energy left and death becomes permanent. The game also introduces boss monsters and special chests that contain a berserk charge for the heroes. Level imbalance is also detected with the introduction of Skyguard to give the losing team a chance to gain experience and move up levels. Item crafting is carried over to multiplayer, but time rewinding is not possible.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=http://www.youtube.com/v/8BzhK-e70y8","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Gaijin Entertainment","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14383,"FileName":"dcd7a69c-788f-4cca-b9b9-70248cbafb5a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14383,"FileName":"1b2e7220-1493-4d20-821f-8048c03ed29e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13849,"Name":"Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War is a historical real-time tactics video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms.

As the developer's first 2D fighter developed for high-definition systems, BlazBlue features fast, anime-inspired fighting action, which plays out over detailed, multi-layered backgrounds, with flashy, sometimes psychedelic visual effects for special attacks and big hits. The fighting takes on a certain rhythm, as there is a split second pause after each hit, giving players who can catch on to the cadence a chance to use the brief freezes to time their next move or counterattack. The action is very fast, and without the stuttering pauses, few humans could hope to keep up. Each character has a special \"drive\" attack move, which is difficult to perform, but devastating if used correctly. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as \"the Library,\" which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways. The game's developer declared BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger to be the \"spiritual successor\" to the Guilty Gear series. Its roster of combatants is a rogue's gallery of weird, super-powered, emotionally complicated characters, including vampires and werewolves, and the beat-'em-up action plays out to an unrelenting precision-metal soundtrack by composer Daisuke Ishiwatari.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Arc System Works","Publisher":"Aksys Games","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"7b544762-14c9-4f69-8233-91e2120ab11a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"98555715-2fcc-49b6-90cf-aeb79be401f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"e14d75b1-7bcb-4f80-80bd-4f51e79bb76f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"55b9d1b7-bac1-4d0e-94df-d257ba42fe1c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"314e2ff4-8c8c-42dd-bb6a-1cef7406050a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"0f487ed4-0bbf-40ea-b6dc-c50701ef6299.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13770,"FileName":"6ae68c9f-df5c-49dd-bad2-7c48b6906ad2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13771,"Name":"BlazBlue: Continuum Shift","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The sequel to 2009's anime-flavored fighting game, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger, BlazBlue: Continuum Shift introduces three new characters, added play options, more stages, and other refinements.

Instead the game is the in-official successor to Chaos League: Sudden Death and builds upon its features.\n\nBased on the Living Rulebook 5.0 ruleset, Blood Bowl is a dark fantasy version of American Football with 11 players per team beating each other to death in order to get a touchdown. The game features eighth races with different strength and weaknesses including the fast but weak Goblins, the flexible but mediocre Humans and the powerful but slow Orcs. The player can either play fast games with pre-defined teams or enter the heart of the game: the campaign. In the campaign the player creates a new team from scratch trying to bring it up to the top of the ranking of the current Blood Bowl-season. To accomplish this goal the player has to buy players with different attributes and skills, close sponsor contracts to earn additional money and decide how to influence the upcoming game by bribing the referee, buying potions for his team and other illegal activities. His players also gain experience points during a match especially for scoring touchdowns or by downing enemy players. Once they gain a level up, they can learn an additional skill like blocking.\n\nOnce the team stands, the game begins with the option to play either in real-time- or turn-based-mode. The turn-based-mode is very close to the table-top game with 8 rounds per half-time, turnover-events and manual dice rolls. Although the real-time-mode also features dice rolls, they are done behind the players backs and the outcome of each action is determined by one or more skill checks. The game grid is also still divided into squares but these are invisible now. The most important difference is that in real-time-mode the player can give orders to more than one player at all times and other elements like turnover-events are removed. If the player still needs time to think about his moves, he can activate the concentration mode which pauses the game and allows him to give orders without pressure.\n\nThe game features several multiplayer-modes including hot seat in which two players can play on one machine in turn-based-mode against each other and worldwide open and private online-leagues for which the players are able to create up to 32 teams.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cyanide S.A.","Publisher":"Focus Home Interactive SAS","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15633,"FileName":"8c9ecb06-a9e4-4f08-97e7-f20220f8706c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12527,"Name":"Blood Drive","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Blood Drive, the player takes part in the Blood Drive Tournament in Las Ruletas.

Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded. They say she can summon clouds of ravens, call up thorns from the ground, and even conjure up lightning and tornadoes at will. \n\nMaybe she flew down from Heaven. Maybe Hell spat her back out. Either way, she's all we've got. \n\nBullet Witch is set on a bleak Earth, in the year 2013. The human race is almost extinct as hideous demons and monsters dominate the planet. It's been decided that only a combination of ancient and modern combat can beat the creatures. Alicia is a highly-trained soldier who also knows ancient magic. The fate of the human race is in her hands as she ventures into the world of monsters and fights them with her mix of magical arts and military equipment.

The objective is to complete a set amount of burgers in a level by walking over its various ingredients and condiments such as patties, cheese, tomatoes and buns from high platforms all the way to the burgers already assembled at the very bottom of the stages.\n\nLevels are shaped in a circular form as a theater-in-the-round setting and they rotate as the player moves left or right, keeping the main character in the center of the screen. Movement between levels is done with ladders and platform while enemies such as eggs, hot dogs, and pickles need to be avoided. They can be sent down by dropping ingredients on them and they can also temporarily be stunned by blasting pepper. A single hit and the main character dies. Peter Pepper also has various power-ups and weapons at his disposal, including a spatula which will knock enemies who follow him around the stages.

The game was not released on the Wii U, making it the first title in the series since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 to not be released on either the Wii or Wii U.

Development for Advanced Warfare began in late 2011, shortly before the release of Modern Warfare 3. The game became the first entry in the Call of Duty series since Call of Duty 2 to feature a game engine that has had its majority re-written and built from scratch. For the game's single-player campaign mode, Sledgehammer employed veteran actors Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey in lead roles. The game's story, featuring a futuristic setting which is set between 2054 and 2061, follows Jack Mitchell of the United States Marine Corps and his interactions with Atlas, a private military corporation that sells its services to the highest bidder.","MaxPlayers":"32","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C2cG30FBas","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sledgehammer Games","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2014-11-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":147571,"FileName":"89728c62-da4f-444b-ae22-71f6f1ff12cd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":147571,"FileName":"59980168-9568-4321-8045-3ecc9ce90f04.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":147571,"FileName":"00b85ece-2c84-4f23-85db-27e48640169f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":147571,"FileName":"49367010-6265-4a9b-866b-b226af8c19f2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11740,"Name":"Call of Duty: Black Ops","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Call of Duty: Black Ops is a first-person shooter with stealth and tactical aspects that puts players in the role of a shadow soldier fighting in a variety of historically representative fictional Black Ops missions of the Cold War era.

It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship . The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode. In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes. In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races.\n\nThe plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit. Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules. Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy.\n\nStory mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints. There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis. There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney/Pixar animated short series \"Cars Toons\" that center around the character Mater. These include \"Mater the Greater\", \"El Materdor\", and \"Tokyo Mater\".\n\nWhile racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time. Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase. There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly. You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dTKnVSENgk","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Incinerator Studios LLC","Publisher":"THQ Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":162441,"FileName":"bc14e20a-9f91-46ed-bcac-b73e1f19cd31.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162441,"FileName":"aa071bb9-cfe3-4158-8c92-104fbc87f68e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162441,"FileName":"5d43148a-26ac-4867-b3cf-64e56329dd7c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8859,"Name":"Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion XL","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your favorite characters from Cartoon Network are coming together in one epic battler! \n\nDid you ever wonder what would happen if Humungousaur and Samurai Jack met up in a dark alley?

The more stages Vincent overcomes, the more complex the strategies required to progress will become. \n\nVarious obstacles impede Vincent’s path. Some blocks are traps, waiting to skewer unwary climbers. Others explode, damaging everything around them. The sheep in the nightmare are desperate to survive until morning, too. They’ll get in your way, mess up your blocks, or even try to shove you off. You’ll need your wits and the help of strange items that can deal with the sheep, remove hazards or create new paths if you want to reach the top!","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NulvkSa2Dzg","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Atlus","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2011-07-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"fabc3329-c674-4a0c-a1ec-0b5970d322cd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"84a4d64d-82f0-402f-8a7a-e8adbc3f9ae4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"57b52bc2-f750-49dc-b315-501fd7ecc146.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"aea0a246-f99d-40ee-92c2-2438f0040ba3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"fc27bc80-546a-4314-9ca1-b84e49ba9489.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"a2bbde41-1ccf-4c0e-81fb-7bb66156b1b8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"ccc61d44-b119-4e16-8e64-2bb55ace3d4c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"230a5d1b-2ed3-42d2-91ba-70b42a7425c6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8860,"FileName":"5c5b2441-ff6c-4d5a-93c5-7a953317235d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187357,"Name":"Centipede & Millipede","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Atari's Centipede is easy to learn, but the tension builds relentlessly as the game progresses.

The game also featured the ability to change and modify rosters and share them online via the newly introduced 2K Share feature. The real coaches feature was dropped from this game, possibly because the coaches chose not to renew their contracts and all of the coaches are unnamed.\n\nThe announcers/commentators featured in the game were Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery. The College Hoops series was put on hiatus in 2008 as 2K Sports declined to seek the college license for a 2K9 release. EA Sports got the contract before 2K did, so EA will continue to make college basketball games. EA discontinued their college basketball game series in 2010.

Three powerful gangs have taken the once-great metropolis hostage, and the police have proven powerless in their efforts to regain control. Only the Agency's deploying genetically enhanced agents of justice can provide citizens with some sense of hope. With an open-ended sandbox environment, players are free to explore the city and decide on the best tactics for each breathtaking scenario. Brace yourself. Justice is coming to Pacific City.\n\nCrackdown pushes the action-driving hybrid genre into the next generation with the first ever truly 3-D playground. Gamers will level up their Agent's strength, agility, firearms, explosives, and driving skills while scaling the fully vertical world. Enforce justice by any means necessary in Pacific City, a crime-ridden urban center primed to explode and ready for you to explore. Enter an interactive world where anything can be used as a weapon as you clean up the streets the only way you know how. Your way. Developed by Scotland's Real Time Worlds exclusively for Microsoft Game Studios and the Xbox 360 console, Crackdown is the brainchild of Dave Jones, the creative genius behind many innovative game titles such as Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings. \n\nHarnessing the amazing power of Xbox 360, Crackdown players enforce justice against the backdrop of a crime-ridden metropolis that is massive in scale and meticulous in detail. The game's unique presentation employs a highly stylized rendering technique that turns it into a living, breathing graphical novel. You play the role of an enforcer for the city's \"Agency,\" a law enforcement entity looking to take back neighborhoods and lives from three large crime syndicates. You are part of the new generation of crime fighters- an entirely new breed of genetically superior super-cops, designed to use the enemies' tactics against them.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92w7Fkahufc","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Sandbox; Shooter","Developer":"Realtime Worlds","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2007-02-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"594310bb-a233-4228-8c46-9a16d649af77.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"80cd9ef1-0adc-4d96-9294-1e2cc2817d5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"5ff78ef3-8192-450e-9286-e2ceaeb51103.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"3a3d5bfa-50ce-40eb-8d6e-032e41ac9c6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"888ca7f5-1487-4500-8ef3-c8aa07e68a8d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"926d7c0b-e49f-438c-ac66-e9815e43a914.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"26d285fa-6fa6-43ef-a263-186b8c4b03b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"6348691a-a456-494e-9147-d2761ddd1f5a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"73d651b6-8fdb-4995-9c0d-beed8b3d0eba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"e5498a57-ccf9-4ed8-8b01-18a2d2cb48b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"b4acf888-3b3c-49cb-bc84-ec55efb5f91e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"0bb00c05-c18b-4ecc-9a3a-398b084bab9d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"cc8256bc-7318-461c-a225-9c597b6d9ef0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"30af8562-26a8-4f56-922d-4807b000e148.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"1f9d643b-cee3-4e21-8dcd-1472cf2db0d4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"8c685e8e-dd95-4be9-bc89-032b79283006.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"caba8e85-b9e2-42e3-bdf7-1298e66e3deb.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"88c3f127-c25f-421f-ae6c-93a8963f86a7.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"451b764b-6f54-4e1f-a81c-5a4d871316fb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"80a4fc49-f668-435d-897d-1ba76b0d3ff7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7167,"FileName":"2fae84d1-a3be-475f-8370-a52d3ac58f38.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12062,"Name":"Crackdown 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You're the judge, jury, and executioner in this sequel to the award-winning vertical-world adventure Crackdown, available only on Xbox 360.

The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game.

Playing in the role of Hayden Tenno, an unscrupulous covert operative sent on an assassination mission into Lasria – a fictional Eastern European city on the brink of ruin and rumored to be contaminated by a mysterious and frightening plague, Hayden takes out his mark, but before he can escape is attacked by an unknown enemy. Not killed outright as expected, he is instead infected with the virus that is causing the plague. \n\nJust as with the other victims swarming the street of Lasria, the Technocyte Virus imbues Hayden with powerful, inhuman abilities. These abilities are not static and as they progress they cause severe, accelerated pain; pain that eventually drives their hosts insane, turning them quite literally into monsters of superhuman power. Hayden possesses an unexpected resistance to this maddening pain, but his body is not spared the mutations caused by the virus. The first of these are metal armor that grows from his body and a three bladed, throwable weapon called a \"glaive\" which explodes from his right arm and can regenerate if lost. But these are only the beginning. Eventually players may also gain the power of limited invisibility, the use of a bulletproof shield, and an assortment of deadly melee attacks. \n\nAs Hayden slashes his way through the mutants overrunning Lasria he stumbles upon a plot by a rogue operative and his private army of henchmen to harness the power of the strongest of these mutants for some dark purpose. No longer entirely human, but not a mindless mutant Hayden must make a decision whether to use his own new powers to stop this plot or look the other way. But regardless of his choice, he has become the target of both the blind rage of his fellow mutants and a shadowy paramilitary group that seeks to control them.","MaxPlayers":"10","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnsjVO3Y6Rw","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Digital Extremes","Publisher":"D3Publisher","ReleaseDate":"2008-03-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"1cffc62f-c30b-4646-93a4-7dfc95185873.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"2783201d-aa08-4445-8bde-d10d3f0680e5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"0fbb8a8d-b3d9-4b70-a976-92dc507c08ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"1106183b-1629-42d0-a0a7-d1aea512a843.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"8d95a673-8ec2-47e3-a46d-95cf381b9ab5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"c749083d-89ea-4d1e-9d07-b8b74fbd01bc.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"c72c7ab4-ee0a-447c-b219-7534cedd468c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"32a36394-58b4-45dd-b084-c2c7f83d734d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":82,"FileName":"84d20cdb-b105-4bdf-97f4-d65b56693024.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7752,"Name":"Dark Souls","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dark Souls is a brand new dark fantasy RPG designed to completely embrace the concepts of tension in dungeon exploration, fear in encountering enemies, the joy of new discoveries, and a high sense of achievement in progressing.

The reason: KronoteK themselves can't do anything themselves in order to keep the time-continuum save. So they need persons marked MIA. People that as far as history is concerned are only a ghost. Of course KronoteK isn't the only time-traveling-agency out there and soon after your first missions in the American Civil War and World War I, the problems suddenly get a lot bigger when well-equipped time-travelers enter the scene and mess everything up.\n\nDarkest of Days is a first-person-shooter with the player and his tutor Dexter entering different periods of time even going as far back as the destruction of Pompey to fulfill their objective according to KronoteK's wishes like making sure that a specific person survives. During their travels they integrate themselves into the setting not only with the correct clothing but also with the weapons fit for the time-period. Only if things get desperate modern guns like a multiple-rockets-launcher or an high-tech assault rifle enter the scene to make things easier. But not everyone can be killed on sight.\n\nImportant persons from history glow either golden or blue. While the first are mission-critical and have to be saved at all costs. The latter can be taken out by either shooting them in their limps or using the so-called chasers, small high-energy-balls that only react to blue-glowing enemies and will take them out without ruining the timeline. Although the mission won't end if the player kills one or more blue-glowing enemies, the reward at the end will decrease from three to no upgrade points at all.

The game takes place across netherworld environments, including \"The White city,\" an outpost where angels live, and \"The Eternal Throne,\" a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses.

A director's cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is similar to a series of murders across the United States.\n\nDeadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.\n\nThe game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have their own schedules.\n\nIt has become known for its \"headline making strangeness\" and is considered one of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both extremely negative and extremely positive reviews and is seen by some as an example of games as art.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVFpvMgH2a4","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Horror; Sandbox; Shooter","Developer":"Access Games","Publisher":"Ignition Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2010-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11991,"FileName":"139ae882-6e9c-4494-b447-3ecf4e4ca6ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11991,"FileName":"b77118b5-eaf4-4655-97c3-a2146a4cc0fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11991,"FileName":"5fb59ce4-020f-4684-b242-b3fb0f5e5b69.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":11991,"AlternateName":"Red Seeds Profile","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":17222,"Name":"Deadpool","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"There are a few important things I need to say before you crack into my insanely sweet game.

Choosing from one of four lolita-style girls, the player must blast their way through seven-plus stages. Unlike many games of this type, enemies appear from all directions, and the player is able to fire to both the left and right. Each character also has a companion familiar who will assist with special attacks, and there are also magic spells that act as screen-clearing bombs. There are multiple paths through the game, multiple difficulty levels for each stage, and numerous optional areas and secret bosses to challenge.\n\nThere are several game modes included. Arcade mode is a direct port of the original arcade release. Ver 1.1 Arrange mode adds the ability to directly control the familiars, and rearranges the stages.

The main difference in approach is that Infinity focuses more on character creation and experimentation with the different elements. The starter version of the game comes with the infinity base and three figurines (Sulley, Mr. Incredible and Jack Sparrow). The base consists of two spots to place figurines that are then imported into the game as playable characters. It also has a hexagonal spot to place up to three power discs. These add enhancements to the game such as changes in the terrain, background, new vehicles or weapons. Red ability discs are placed underneath a character on the base as perks, with a maximum of two per character and four in total. Orange toy discs add gadgets and vehicles. Purple customization discs alter the environment and sky. For orange and purple discs only a maximum of three at a time is allowed. Discs are sold separately in series, blind packages and through specific promotions and retailers. The same goes for figurines and Play Sets. There are also rare discs with a hologram in the middle.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Avalanche Software","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18011,"FileName":"c9a1a5f6-048a-4a5b-b801-f87986be4d5f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18011,"FileName":"c4fdedda-6a2f-4160-895f-9b7a0f123aa5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":173258,"Name":"Disney Infinity 2.0 Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Disney Infinity 2.0 is the successor to Disney Infinity and it introduces the second generation of the concept as an entirely new game. Just like the original game it is an action-adventure where players place physical figurines on the infinity base with a USB connection to the system and they are then introduced as characters in the game. The characters level up as they are used and progress is stored in the character itself, meaning they can level up further using them on a different system or on a different location. The figurines that can be purchased are platform independent. There are two large groups of characters: Marvel Super Heroes and Disney Originals.\n\nAs in the first game it is split up into two game modes. The story part of the game (Play Set mode) is enabled through a play set that resembles a crystal figurine placed on the base. Infinity 2.0 supports multiple, self-contained story modes based on the purchased play sets. The core gameplay is a traditional action platformer. Characters are guided through the game world and have different types of moves. Some characters excel at melee combat, while others rely on ranged attacks. As the characters level up new abilities and attributes become available, assigned through a skill tree. Skills levels can be reset at level 10 and 20 to try different paths. Some characters have special abilities such as flight (Iron Man) or web-swinging (Spider-Man).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Avalanche Software","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios","ReleaseDate":"2014-11-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"2a5f6a0c-1689-497a-9cb5-2d31183d8be2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"dea4fee6-8a9f-429b-89d8-adafbb6f87e2.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"0fb7aa8d-ae17-4710-b023-ca0f3e8bb19e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"9024ba11-262c-4ee6-bb71-b81eb1b75817.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"e2a30daf-f891-4853-9329-76d8d53aa71a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"0ea6a5ca-c0bd-4c06-800f-e2246928e746.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"f236ceea-3c6b-464f-a3d9-d0f41a13114f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173258,"FileName":"48f469f1-392e-46e4-8414-c5311a4370b2.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34244,"Name":"Disney Infinity 3.0 Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Do you already own Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 and want to play Disney Infinity 3.0?

I never thought of that\", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series.\n\nAnd once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal: the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are awaiting...\n\nThe bee is still humming.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Cave","Publisher":"Rising Star Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23408,"FileName":"78984a0e-6d19-425a-8a71-df4e8083b37a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23408,"FileName":"b6cecc52-b1f6-41ce-896f-5b38468f0e56.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23408,"FileName":"80268eea-d0e2-477e-a06b-5a6b6015d6b8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23408,"FileName":"9b21f023-c5df-4c0b-9123-813bb9e6bff0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23408,"FileName":"4affe4e4-c741-4c3c-9a77-6ac92a4b77cc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23728,"Name":"DoDonPachi Saidaioujou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"DoDonPachi SaiDaiOuJou (怒首領蜂 最大往生 Dodonpachi Saidaiōjō?) is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released by Cave in 2012.

Just like the original title the two protagonists are the brothers Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee. They need to rescue the girl Marian who has been kidnapped by the Shadow Warriors gang and their leader Skullmageddon. The game uses many features and elements from the first three Double Dragon games with a number of novelties. The game is now in a 3D and sports an eighties neon look with electro music and many elements that refer to American culture.\n\nThe game takes place over ten levels, starting in the familiar city streets and then moving on to a dojo in outer space, an Asian countryside, a laboratory, a graveyard and finally Skullmageddon's palace. Most levels have a boss at the end. Actions are performed through three main buttons to punch, kick and throw. These can be combined into various combos. Throws can generally only be performed when enemies are left dazed after a series of attacks. Entirely new is a run button to sprint at enemies and perform two types of attacks. While jumping two types of jumping attacks can be performed. A duck button is used for two additional attacks, either doing a leg sweep or a high knee kick. Duck has another use, as successfully timing it to avoid an incoming attack provides 'gleam'. The character receives a red glow for a short time and does double damage. A finisher move can be performed when an enemy is on the ground.\n\nNext to the fighting there are hazards to avoid and jumping sections. Enemies leave behind weapons such as guns, baseball bats, whips, bombs and fans that can be picked up to attack or throw. The game encourages cooperative play with another player. In a two-player game the characters can high-five each other to split and share their life meters. Another ability is 'psych' where the other character can be put out of harm or made to fall over to get out a difficult situation. Gleam can be passed on by doing a high-five. There are three types of high-fives in total and they can even be performed by leaping across the screen. When one player is dead, the other can steal a life if there are at least two remaining. There is also an option to trigger friendly fire.\n\nItems found along the way include sodas to replenish health, batteries to charge magic, extra lives, cash and mythril (after defeating a boss). These are often hidden in destructible objects. Two abilities are acquired by picking up songs of buying them from tapesmiths in in-game shops where they can be forged into mix tapes. The A side provides Sosetsitsu magic, the B side a stance. Stances are passive abilities that influence stats in various ways. These can be upgraded by spending cash. Magic is upgraded through the rarer mythril provided by bosses. Magic provides a special attack that can be performed when a meter is filled up. These include powerful kicks and combos, but also a dragon that burns the entire screen. Stances and magic can be swapped at any time. After a level has been unlocked, it can be played right away without going through the entire game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Beat 'em Up","Developer":"WayForward Technologies, Inc.","Publisher":"Majesco Entertainment Company","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"ac350484-6660-40d4-bdca-869d319483b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"69c9dbb2-6d42-4cff-b980-f354742a693f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"6d50e80f-419a-470c-a02d-bd49bb32bac4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"62536448-1cb2-45e1-96e5-932f2ec2885b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"7a9bfa3e-b63b-4973-8d4d-67c906d19a25.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"06c28adc-f72e-481d-8ae9-16a90f8826ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"f95485bf-822d-41f4-b4c7-d605c46b26ec.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"249ad2bd-2266-4b0d-aa8a-dcdaa6d56544.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164590,"FileName":"82e64c0c-acb7-4596-8fcc-dff7beb857c8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14287,"Name":"Double Fine Happy Action Theater","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Double Fine Happy Action Theater (sometimes referred to as Happy Action Theater) is a casual video game developed by Double Fine Productions and distributed by Microsoft Game Studios.

Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13187,"FileName":"3db3cd9d-b86b-4ba1-bdf2-308a388fd727.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13187,"FileName":"26d8e4b9-1495-47ed-9d12-b48cfdd7613d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13187,"FileName":"7d9881f5-d2bc-440b-afce-858775b019eb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95090,"Name":"Ecco The Dolphin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95090,"FileName":"7b1891d2-40fa-496c-b73b-a39e4c6b98b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95090,"FileName":"707afae2-6e62-4291-b208-e8150297d41e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162692,"Name":"Eets Chowdown","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Eets: Chowdown, you guide the titular creature Eets through more than 100 levels to collect puzzle pieces with gameplay using combined elements from Lemmings and The Incredible Machine.

These items range from whales that spit Eets up to another platform; to mood-altering buds that dictate whether he will make a long jump, a short hop, or shy away from edges altogether.\n\nEach level is divided into a build stage and an action stage. In the build stage the level remains frozen while you are free to place items where you deem appropriate. In the action stage, Eets drops in and begins his trek to the end. Along his path you can activate certain items with button presses, while some remain inactive until Eets comes across them. If Eets claims the puzzle piece, you are graded on time and item-related factors, such as how many you used.\n\nThe other part of Eets: Chowdown, Marsho Madness, places Eets' head in the middle of swarming creatures. You fend them off by entering the button combinations above their heads. If they reach the middle, you lose a life.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version updates the original game Eets: Hunger.

It is a city built high up to the sky upon a tower-like structure. The story of the game focuses on Vashyron, who is the leader of the PMF (Private Military Firm), as well as two other characters named Zephyr and Leanne, who join Vashyon's group and take on missions from the citizens of Basel.\n\nCombat in Resonance of Fate is done through a unique turn-based system dubbed tri-Attack-Battle (t-A-B). Movement, charging, and attacks are done using the action gauge until a character's turn is over. However, enemies still attack in real time while the player is performing actions. Before attacking an enemy the player needs to build up their charge, which builds up fast if a character is closer to the enemy. Attacks in battle require at least one full charge to be successful and either deal non-permanent scratch damage with machine guns and rapid fire weapons or permanent direct damage with handguns and grenades. Dealing direct damage also makes scratch damage permanent. Once an attack is completed the character's turn is over, so it is up to the player to use their characters to deal both types of damage timely and effectively against enemies.\n\nSpecial attacks in the game are presented in the form of Hero Actions where a character can be sent down a path shooting multiple times and multiple enemies while invincible to enemy attacks. Hero Actions cost Bezels and once they are depleted the player enters Critical Condition in which they cannot use items and both their attack and accuracy are greatly reduced, however Bezels can be recovered by destroying an enemy's body part or defeating it entirely. Hero Actions can also built up to another type of special attack called a Tri-Attack where all three characters will attack at once, but it can only be performed once certain conditions are met.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162702,"FileName":"43b53a71-80a7-495e-b574-507d56e2bd7b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162702,"FileName":"07567a3d-8283-4a93-a187-b2704b8a0ed0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":162702,"AlternateName":"Resonance of Fate","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":155172,"Name":"Endless Midnight: Zombie Swarm","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Blast your way through a horde of zombies with a top-notch arsenal!

The player takes control of the American war correspondent Robert Hawkins who fought along with the resistance fighters in various locations in Europe such as Germany, France and Norway, along with the Warsaw Uprising in Poland. The game starts with an audio broadcast where Hawkins announces he will tell the story of what he has seen and the game is then played as a flashback.\n\nHawkins needs to complete various missions often fighting along with other soldiers. There is a large arsenal of weapons, including hand guns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles, as well a weapon types commonly associated with resistance fighters such as the sten gun, the welrod pistol, the lightning submachine gun and molotov cocktails. Weapons and ammo are picked up along the way or weapons are swapped with those left behind by dead soldiers. Next to pure action, a tactical approach through sabotage and stealth is possible. Hawkins can silently take soldiers hostage, dispose of them and drag their bodies to a sport where they are unlikely to be discovered. The game also has a noise indicator, where loud noises such as planes flying by offer a time-frame to shoot without being revealed. A mini-map in the bottom left corner provides an overview of the environment. Whilst sneaking through foliage stealth kills can also be performed directly. Objects such as stones can be thrown to distract enemies and lure them away. Hawkins also has binoculars to watch the enemy's movement from a distance.\n\nHawkins' health status is revealed through visual cues; when injured the screen has a red glow and fades. Health restores automatically when keeping a low profile for a while. There are three difficulty levels to choose from (casual, normal and expert). On expert enemy markers on the mini-map are removed, making it more difficult to keep track of opponents. While using the sniper rifle Hawkins can hold his breath to steady the view and slightly slow down time. The different levels are split up in multiple sections with primary and secondary objectives such as rescuing hostages, locating officers, stealing supplies and placing explosives. The progress is largely linear with a small number of choices with a different outcome, but the size of the environment often allows for different approaches. Online multiplayer is supported for up to twelve players simultaneously.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter; Stealth","Developer":"CI Games","Publisher":"Bandai Namco","ReleaseDate":"2014-06-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":162694,"FileName":"9d8521bc-7122-4aaf-97eb-1a34eaf68036.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162694,"FileName":"bb5e5870-569a-4246-9aa7-21aba707ad1f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":162694,"FileName":"43084da6-8d0e-4f5d-90dc-3a23b29b5112.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162694,"FileName":"84f35e68-4afa-497e-8d29-8b882e88927b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7471,"Name":"Enemy Territory: Quake Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Enemy Territory: Quake Wars is a first-person shooter video game developed by Splash Damage and published by Activision for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[12] The prequel to Quake II, Quake Wars is set in the same science fiction universe as Quake II and Quake 4, with a minimal back-story serving as a prequel to Quake II.

In the game the player takes on the role of the protagonist from the book and film, Eragon, and occasionally controls his dragon Saphira.\n\nThe game was generally received poorly by critics, usually receiving press averages around the 4-6 out of 10 region (or the equivalent).[4][5] The combined sales in North America were over 400,000 copies.[6]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2006-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7472,"FileName":"90d3da7b-b34b-4e38-bdb2-76ee1861d241.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7472,"FileName":"ede2e355-98d7-46d8-92f0-388122ee078d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7472,"FileName":"4d826c46-f86a-42fa-9880-36874eb6f1f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32897,"Name":"Escape Dead Island","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Escape Dead Island is a third-person action-adventure video game with an emphasis on stealth and melee combat, with some gunplay. Players can crouch to sneak up on enemies and execute them from behind, or engage enemies in melee by swinging a melee weapon at them. Melee utilizes light attacks, heavy attacks, and a dodge move. Specific enemies can be locked onto to focus the camera and the player's attacks on them. A silenced pistol and a shotgun are available and can be aimed and fired from an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective, but ammo is limited. The game lacks the RPG-like elements of the main Dead Island games; there are no player levels, and weapon selection is non-customizable, with weapons being collected at fixed points in the game's story. As a journalist, the player character carries a camera that can be used to take pictures of significant objects in the game environment, causing the character to comment on them. The player character's deteriorating mental state plays a significant role in gameplay, with many unreal events occurring such as buildings falling from the sky, or the player abruptly transporting from one location to another when attempting to cross a room. The game uses a cel-shaded graphics style.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Horror; Stealth","Developer":"Fatshark","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32897,"FileName":"05a81fb5-f46e-40bc-be22-1fec5abd6afc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32897,"FileName":"b09803fe-a520-4c40-b5ba-e3107a181636.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32897,"FileName":"3c9f5dc7-5ae2-4fe2-9a1f-ab4adf088525.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32897,"FileName":"e3f179d2-cd3e-49e3-b994-65d2779fcd8d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155176,"Name":"Escape Goat","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A goat, imprisoned for witchcraft, must escape the treacherous Prison of Agnus.

The player is tasked with stopping the invasion using a fighter ship capable of great attack and defense technology.\nThe ship has two modes of fire: the long range Front Shot and the short range Wide Shot.

Collecting Power Ups increase player fire power, but decreases shield percentage.\n\nThe game spans over six stages that are organized with about four to six Areas per stage. There is a unique timing score utilized in each game (Eschatos, Judgment Silver Sword and Cardinal Sins): a timer is set to count up with every enemy wave and boss encounter. The timer stops once all enemies/bosses are defeated and the score is determined with how quickly each enemy wave/boss was destroyed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Qute","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-04-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23727,"FileName":"9f476e0d-39d8-4008-880f-a52f503ab0fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23727,"FileName":"38200c2b-2e1d-4606-987f-8e8b74d0e613.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23726,"Name":"Espgaluda 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Espgaluda II (エスプガルーダII) is a manic shooter originally released by Cave in the arcades in 2005 as a sequel to Espgaluda.

Stages begin with a set time limit and enemies appearing on screen in randomized patterns. When the player detonates their ship and an enemy is caught in its blast radius, the enemy will explode and have its own blast radius that other enemies can get caught in, causing a chain reaction. The goal is to destroy the maximum amount of ships on screen by positioning and detonating at the right moment, setting off a chain reaction of explosions and earning combo bonus. The first enemy in a chain is worth 10 points and each successive blast doubles in value up to a maximum of 2560 points. Blowing oneself up takes away from one's overall 'stock' of lives. Additional lives are gained after a certain number of points have been obtained. The requirement to obtain lives increases after each new life gained.[2][3]\n\nGreen enemies drop point bonus items that begin at 800 points, and if collected continuously without detonating or losing a life, they increase by an additional 800 points. Pink enemies drop quickens which raises the speed of enemies and spawn rate. Mini-bosses drop yellow items that grants 10-second time extensions. If the ship is destroyed without detonating, the player receives a 5-second penalty. Pulse bombs don't drop items or bonus but instead charge and detonate a wider range than normal once defeated. If the player runs out of lives or time, they lose the game[2][3]\n\nIn Every Extend Extra and Every Extend Extra Extreme, each stage has its own unique music, background, enemy design, and bosses. It also adds varying explosion types to the Every Extend template, which can link chains in different ways, as well as a \"charge\" feature. By holding down the explosion button, players can charge the bomb; the longer the button is held, the larger the blast radius, expanding the possibility for chaining explosions. Quickens dropped by enemies increase the speed of both the player and the enemy, as well as the speed of that stage's music. Each stage is played out to a time limit, with a boss character appearing at a set point towards the end. Rather than attacking the boss directly, the player relies on destroying the required number of regular enemies near the boss to cause a 'hit'","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162695,"FileName":"b57e51fb-db56-4084-b498-e37a35ebd119.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162695,"FileName":"3abdc399-f26a-41ba-817d-1672ee944a38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162696,"Name":"Everyone Sing","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Everyone Sing is the first multi-format singing game where everyone can sing.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162696,"FileName":"b70f0d74-618b-4507-8c7d-dbb59baa8bf9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162696,"FileName":"0406b7b6-b4a3-4830-a19b-c18ab0f3bcb3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187358,"Name":"Exit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Exit is a unique puzzle game for the PSP.

The content focuses on the titular event in Fallout '​s alternate history. During the Great War, the United States Army liberated Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese forces. The pack contains several new quests, new items, and adds four new achievements. Gameplay within the simulation is different than the main game; health and ammo are replenished by stations in certain areas of the simulation world, items functionally do not suffer from decay, and enemy corpses disappear instead of allowing the player to loot them for supplies.\n\nOperation: Anchorage was released in North America and Europe on January 27, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live.[8][9] Although the content was scheduled for release on the PlayStation 3 in June 2009, the final week of June's PlayStation Store updates did not include it. Bethesda released information suggesting that the delay was due to their desire to iron out all of the bugs before release as well as test compatibility between DLCs.[10] Operation: Anchorage, along with The Pitt, were released on October 1, 2009, for PS3.[11]\n\nThe Pitt[edit]\nThe Pitt is the second downloadable content pack. It allows the player to journey to the industrial raider town known as The Pitt, in the remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The pack features several new weapons, new armor and clothing items, four achievements and around four to five hours of gameplay. The Pitt was released on March 24, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live, but was quickly removed due to glitches in the gameplay which made the Xbox 360 version of the expansion unplayable. Further investigation was performed by Bethesda and Microsoft, and on March 25, 2009,[19] the expansion was again uploaded to Xbox Live, and was made available again that afternoon. For those who downloaded it on March 24 in the morning, glitches were still apparent. A new version was available on Xbox Live on April 2, fixing freezing issues many players had encountered with the previous version.[20] A retail disk was released at the end of May 2009[21] containing this and the Operation: Anchorage downloadable content. It was released for Xbox 360 and Games for Windows. The downloadable content is copied to the hard drive and function as it would had it been downloaded. This pack was released for the PlayStation 3 at the same time as Operation Anchorage on October 1, 2009.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"DLC","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Role-Playing; Shooter","Developer":"Bethesda Game Studios","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2009-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13862,"FileName":"7cf8ba80-17ff-400f-9331-1769f28fd68c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12646,"Name":"Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Vault 101 -- Jewel of the Wastes.

The player takes control of the character known as the Courier, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, the player becomes caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants.\n\nEven though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 in order of Fallout game releases, offers a similar action role-playing experience, and shares its engine and legacy content with Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a direct sequel. It marks the return of some elements found in Fallout 2. The game was a critical and commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies altogether. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold almost 12 million copies worldwide.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-x-1fm2cq8","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing; Shooter","Developer":"Obsidian Entertainment","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"865f3094-b892-43dd-b343-1b3cb683c49d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"6318ae4a-fdd1-4d06-91a5-b0bcd511eac6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"b641fbe0-1aae-47fe-a021-2c5dcb2f2a97.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"8be642c9-a7c1-43cf-9e55-f5a6c0cba245.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"88ce3bd1-4f1d-468f-b76c-3c1d18294c52.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"3fb70f48-20b0-4f3c-95b9-95a2f1057a41.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"45fb5944-f62e-42cb-873e-87f40be72ce7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"25969bea-ea22-4f56-ab56-3397f7410015.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"3eae14f9-c496-4fe0-96af-7d59b209c38f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"10e3e9d1-1e43-4ec6-9038-e07f5a1c57f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"0ef238b6-b168-434c-b8de-7a531feec749.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"425418a2-f8f0-4fc8-b248-4301bad35828.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"9bbf36cd-f588-4730-8898-01edd3aab662.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"b38799d1-97f1-47da-b9c6-bd7ec51eb599.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"faa12d41-8eb2-4ac4-a52b-ef6c98d85531.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8162,"FileName":"8e0124dc-e63c-42f1-9acd-339dc411f057.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11945,"Name":"Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are on a perilous journey across the Great Southwest in a post-nuclear world.

It is the first Family Feud video game to be released on Xbox 360 and the third to be developed on Wii by Ludia Inc.\n\nIn Family Feud, one hundred people were surveyed and gave answers to various questions. Two families then battle each other by trying to guess the top answers to each question. In each round, a member of each family is asked to join the host on the center of the stage to answer one question. The quickest player to buzz in gets to answer first. If he/she doesn't give the number one answer, the other player can give his/her answer as well. Whoever has the best answer will then decide to either \"play\" or \"pass\". If the player decides to play, his/her family will have to guess all the answers to win the round. If the player decides to pass, the opposing family will have to find all the answers.\n\nEach wrong answer results in a strike. After three strikes, the other family has a chance to steal the points.

It is the second installment of the main Far Cry series; the sequels Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 were released in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nUbisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, however the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a modern-day Central African nation during civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate \"The Jackal\", a notorious gun runner.

It has no narrative ties to Far Cry 3, but carries over many gameplay elements. The game is set in Kyrat, a fictional region based on the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is governed by the depostic king Pagan Min. The player controls Ajay Ghale, an American with Kyrati roots who returns to the region to disperse his deceased mother's ashes. As soon as he arrives he is dragged into the conflict and is rescued by the rebel organization The Golden Path started by his parents. During the game the Ajay can eventually choose which force to side with, with different endings. Inside The Golden Path there is a power struggle, and Ajay can choose between missions for Amita or Sabal, with different objectives based on the choices.\n\nThe mountainous region has both lush environments and snowy mountains. Vertical heights can be scaled using a grappling hook, and a glider or a zipline is used to move down. The player can follow the story missions or explore freely. Various vehicles are available to cross the distances and there is a fast travel option for important locations. There is an auto drive option where vehicles follow the roads to the next waypoint while the player can concentrate on shooting. Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale's journal.\n\nBell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.\n\nThe single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9al_k8e93I","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Ubisoft Divertissements Inc.","Publisher":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA","ReleaseDate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"85b23ca2-9a22-4c19-9559-64b823f4a05f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"e84fc455-3da5-46b8-9d35-5617e2894a31.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"52115959-0849-4621-9d68-cbeff6f5dd91.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"d4771c83-81f7-42f5-b9d3-dda6d2df556e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"4280a78a-4b07-4dfb-9de8-ebd2db3cb677.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"c9a57b5b-5570-4c24-8170-832158633e53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"f278e779-c848-4d66-9f9f-2554648e876e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"334c115d-1071-4dec-b0fe-903a8fa9bf0c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"9aabf773-f583-4c35-8a72-02b630baec18.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"99757aa0-2f5a-43f0-ac6a-d811427cb231.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"b6fea0d4-1ff0-42cf-8c7c-45eadf18dbff.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":29387,"FileName":"8ff3abcc-18e2-4232-aa7b-725d9b79b4dd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22678,"Name":"Far Cry Classic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Far Cry Classic is the ultimate console version of the very first Far Cry game, bringing you back to the roots of this franchise.

Carver is a former service member of the United States Navy, who was dishonorably discharged following a number of illegal actions. Afterwards, he sets up a shop in Manhattan and began supplying illegal arms to anyone and everyone, until a gang performed a hit using weapons supplied by Jack against a Mafia heir. Consequently, a price was put on his head by the Mob and he was forced to flee the United States and settle in Micronesia.\n\nCarver purchased a used boat from a government auction and spent his time ferrying tourists and diving clubs around the area. Eventually, a woman named Valerie Cortez shows up, offering a large sum if Jack would take her to a remote archipelago known as \"Jacutan\". Carver accepts, albeit with caution.\n\nUpon arriving at Jacutan, Cortez borrows a jet-ski from Jack and heads off on her own. Unworried, Jack decides to nap until she returns. When he awakes, Carver is startled to find UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying around his boat. They open fire on him, destroying his boat and force him to take cover inside a nearby wrecked Japanese aircraft carrier.\n\nAt this point, the player assumes control. After a brief introduction level, the player acquires a headset and is directed by a mysterious voice who calls himself \"Doyle\". As it turns out, Cortez is part of the CIA and came to rescue Doyle. Doyle had been on a mission to expose the works of a mad scientist named Dr. Krieger. Krieger, along with his right-hand man, an ex-Apartheid officer named Colonel Richard Crowe, were attempting to develop a serum that would enhance the physical abilities of man and \"unlock\" hidden animal traits.\n\nDoyle convinces Carver to find and rescue Cortez, who has been captured by Crowe and his mercenaries. While covering Cortez, Carver himself is captured by Crowe on the orders of Doctor Krieger, who notes Carver's resourcefulness and tenacity and decided he would make a good test subject. Carver is injected with the serum and is to be transported to an observation area when he recovers prematurely and escapes and discovers, to his shock, that he has new \"feral abilities\", such as increased speed, night vision and a violent melee attack.\n\nAlong with the feral powers comes an implant designed to regulate the serum's effects and allows for specialized weapons to be used against Carver. Doyle commands Carver to find his way to Doyle's position, so that the implant can be removed. Along the way, Carver has to prevent a mercenary computer programmer from deciphering a pocket PC that belongs to Cortez, which would, in turn, blow Doyle's cover. Descending into an old World War II-era Japanese bunker to stop the decryption, Jack is cornered by the mercenaries as he attempts to escape. He retreats through an old underground mining complex and follows Doyle's instructions to the main research facility. Carver then makes his way to the facility, where he discovers the extent of Krieger's work and the mutant monsters he has created. While in the facility, Carver discovers Crowe is gathering the mutants for an unknown purpose and then later, he finally meets with Doyle, who frees Carver from the implant. Upon having the implant removed, Jack begins to exhibit uncontrolled evolution; in game terms, the adrenaline cost for his abilities decreases and he gains the ability to carry and wield mounted weapons like the .50 caliber machine gun.\n\nAs Jack escapes the research facility, he discovers that Crowe has taken Doyle and the mutant serum and has unleashed the mutants in a plot to betray Krieger. Jack must fight through the middle of a war between Crowe's mercenaries, the feral mutants and an elite group of special forces under Krieger's personal command, under orders to \"sanitize\" Crowe's troops. Rescuing Doyle, Carver discovers that Crowe has injected himself with a quadruple dose of the serum Jack received and without an implant. Assuming control of the \"Alpha\" creatures, the most powerful and intelligent mutants with abilities similar to Jack's own, Crowe has gone straight to Kreiger's base of operations. Jack follows and fights his way to Dr. Krieger's mansion atop an active volcano, where he battles and defeats the physically deformed Crowe. Krieger, in a last-ditch effort to use the Alphas against Jack, realizes that they now view Jack as their leader due to his victory over Crowe. The mutants turn on Dr. Krieger and kill him, viewing him as a threat to Jack, and thus allow him to escape as the volcano erupts. Jack is able to retreat onto a Black Hawk piloted by Cortez and Doyle, who promise to pay for a new boat to replace his destroyed one; Doyle also promises that they \"can do one better\" and slides a metal case to Jack, who opens it and laughs cryptically at the unseen contents as the helicopter flies away.\n\nThe game includes subtle thematic elements relating to the dangers of genetic engineering and the genocide of local islanders, as can be seen by the deformed creatures created by Krieger. Also, a mysterious backdrop relating to dinosaurs is revealed via in-game radios that will sometimes carry programs that discuss the history of dinosaurs and the possibility that some might still be alive. This is further developed by appearance of lizard-like animals (which resemble small dinosaurs) that reside in the jungles on the island.\n\nThe terrain in Far Cry: Instincts varies greatly. Set on a South Pacific archipelago, the landscape includes tropical rainforests, dense jungles, towering canyons, mines, swamps, and even volcanic forests.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"ea64c8a6-2f7b-4481-96ef-dedb9f7f4081.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"8f29bd5a-cf48-4aae-9771-89298a5a6eb7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"d07c23eb-c662-417c-8c51-32bec4083a8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"171c5bb3-b901-4f83-8096-43c65ad700dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"4f597f14-5f90-4bca-8648-742c5855e278.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"92a31660-9981-4e4d-bd3e-6f9c059f9cbb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"15a6db4b-ce6c-47b7-84a8-7d9b3fedad9f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"2337c432-ba6a-4f4f-8ffb-f66aa4601d3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"fbdb5399-a048-410a-9392-778c7e7383a6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"e78b21cd-6cc5-494b-b63e-c1a85cba910b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"b923bb3b-1d77-4091-8789-124c9b5ae8d6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7475,"FileName":"a5973b10-6ea7-40e6-90bc-e094d04d82c3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":101111,"Name":"Far Cry: The Wild Expedition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A compilation to celebrate 10 years of the Far Cry franchise!\n\nEach Far Cry game included in the The Wild Expedition compilation offers a unique storyline and setting that will keep gamers engaged for hours as they experience the expansive open world beauty, original narrative and the memorable characters all combined with classic Far Cry FPS gameplay.  \n\nFar Cry Classic - Far Cry Classic is the premiere and ultimate console version of the very first Far Cry game.

The player controls the protagonist of the game, Simon, through his attempts to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord.[1] The game features one gamemode called \"Fight\" which is only accessible after completing the tutorial.[2] Fighters Uncaged is played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the opponent being on the opposite side.[2] Simon is able to do a range of different actions, including short and long punches, kicks, blocks, dodges, and headbutts.[1] The player can execute special moves via shouting in the direction of the Kinect, once the corresponding bar is full.[3] Fighting consists of looking for telegraphs in the movements of one's opponents to figure out when to dodge or block attacks, then hitting them while they are vulnerable. In the early stages of Fighters Uncaged, it is made less difficult to read the telegraphs of the opponent, but as the player progresses, they become increasingly imperceptible. The moves Simon can complete depend on where the opponent is at the time, and therefore only certain moves will land hits at particular moments.[1] Fighters Uncaged features different leagues, with higher leagues being reached by having a certain number of points. Points are obtained by defeating the opponent, while having a good score. Good scores are attained by accomplishing counter attacks, exploiting the enemies' weak spots, and correctly completing combos. If a good score is not secured at the end of the fight, no points are rewarded","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":28528,"FileName":"803b8ed8-d998-4cc2-8adf-2b5f6b8bfaf7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202239,"Name":"Fighting Vipers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":202239,"FileName":"ad7aa5c5-fc47-4a54-b517-a7088b65d357.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17393,"Name":"Final Fantasy XI Online","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Final Fantasy XI (ファイナルファンタジーXI Fainaru Fantajī Irebun?), also known as Final Fantasy XI Online, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), developed and published by Square (later Square Enix) as part of the Final Fantasy series.

In XIII, one of the fal'Cie—a god-like race—transformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit), in the hope that they would initiate the end of the world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.\n\nXIII-2 begins three years after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the collapse of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPPuHHfUwOc","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Square-Enix","Publisher":"Square-Enix","ReleaseDate":"2012-01-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"c28fdabe-7630-4f01-b725-82f66dca66ee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"23bcba04-889d-4f98-a8f8-fe660df519c8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"c3a3cbcb-f45d-4702-bf07-fecc0c2011cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"2b6d52c2-8813-474a-9ee0-84e3d790a05d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"7b164c92-07b1-449b-bec6-4e0d003ea4bf.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"c82f2bbe-dcc2-4d9f-adc6-b588d51a02fe.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"e601f93d-8810-49f4-ab42-195e84698191.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"d075a1ea-4cdf-476b-b9c0-ed69d697c28a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"9b70dbc8-f793-47b7-b066-b6e6774d72ae.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"06975df8-fb9d-42e2-a7a5-aeaabddb8835.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12080,"FileName":"dd2dbd3b-a48f-4465-94af-476cfd5bfbda.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18997,"Name":"Final Fantasy XIII-2: Collector's Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Three years after the events in FINAL FANTASY XIII, Lightning has gone missing, and Snow is nowhere to be found.

The objective of the game is to obtain ten cars from the movie Furious 7. This is accomplished via participation in various races and other events. The game exhibits many elements known from the core Forza Horizon franchise: the player can participate in circuit races, point-to-point races, showcase events (where he must win against non-standard competitors, like an attack helicopter), speed traps and speedzones, bounty boards and additional challenges known as the bucket list. Many of the features however have been cut - there are no experience points and perks, obtainable cars are limited to the vehicles from the movie cars the player can obtain in his garage (though there are some other cars that are drivable in certain events), and unlike Forza Horizon 2 players cannot paint, upgrade, sell or tune the vehicles.\n\nGraphically each version uses a different engine. Differences are notable in draw distance, density of foliage, shadows, rendering and lighting. While both versions have a day-night cycle like the original game, Xbox One introduces more varied weather conditions with atmospheric effects. Any route is basically the same on both versions, but the Xbox One version has more traffic and more variation in the environmental design.

Players compete in events around the globe using real licensed cars on a variety of real world and fictional courses. It features an arcade mode, meant more for quickplay of races, and a career mode, which is focused on long-term play. Career mode spans several racing disciplines, spanning from racing of common commuter cars to those in racing series such as Super GT and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters as well as other sports car racing series. The game supports split-screen, System Link and Xbox Live multiplayer gaming. Split-screen allows two player head-to-head racing, while both System Link and Xbox Live allow up to eight players to participate in a single race. Using Xbox Live, players can also buy in-game cars through the game's auction house, sell and 'gift' cars.\n\nMost cars in Forza 2 can be visually customized with both aerodynamic parts as well as graphics. 1,000 layers of graphics can be created with the livery editor to draw shapes, letters and pictures onto a car.[1] According to the developer, it is preventing possible copyright conflicts, also reducing loads in online races. Paint schemes can be auctioned online to other players for in-game credits. Many players reproduced paint schemes appeared in real world, or creating Itashas through this system. There are 349 cars available (including downloadable content) in Forza Motorsport 2. They are divided into six production classes and four race classes. A car's class can limit races for which it is eligible.[2] The final list of cars was revealed on April 20, 2007.[3] Famous racing car drivers from racing series such as Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, Formula One and Le Mans Series will appear in exhibition races if the player selects racing cars for the race. Some drivers include Allan McNish, Pedro Lamy, Johnny Herbert, Max Papis, Kamui Kobayashi and Christophe Bouchut.\n\nForza Motorsport 2 concentrates on circuit racing; point to point races which were featured in the original Forza Motorsport have been removed.[4] Real world tracks Road Atlanta, Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Tsukuba, Mugello Circuit, Sebring International Raceway, Suzuka Circuit, and Nürburgring Nordschleife are licensed and included. Forza 2 is also one of the first racing games to prominently feature cars from the American Le Mans Series in both the game and downloadable content.\n\nThe damage and physics in the game have been revamped over the previous game, allowing for multiple settings: \"simulation,\" which is the most severe, allowing for damage that can take a car out of commission; \"limited,\" which scales down the severity of impact of crashes; and \"cosmetic,\" where the damage is merely visual.[5] The damage ratings for each part of the vehicle can be seen on the HUD (heads up display) accessed from the in-game menu.

This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel.

It features a partnership with BBC's Top Gear as well as its American counterpart. Jeremy Clarkson, presenter for Top Gear, provides commentary in the game's Autovista mode. Other partnerships include a two-year agreement with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS). Over 500 cars and 26 tracks are included.\n\nThe game received universal acclaim from critics. Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report scores of 90.50% and 91 out of 100, respectively. Metacritic also reports eight perfect scores from various media outlets. Critics praised the enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave high marks for the Forza 4 '​s Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3.

The Atlantic is devoted to advancing the technological prowess of humanity, while the Pacific is devoted to enhancing the human genome. When the xenophobia reaches an unfortunate peak, war erupts, and an army from the Atlantic is dispatched to deal with the Pacific force. Players control Sergeant Jet Brody as he leads his attack team against the Pacific force. His first target is Alcatraz Island, where Brody is able to test all the Pacific's found weapons. Both the Atlantic and the Pacificans have a trade monopoly in the area to promote the sciences.\n\nJet Brody is ordered to capture Sheridan, the Pacifican commander, the player's team is ambushed and Sheridan escapes. During the pursuit in a dropship, the ship is shot down, and Brody is the only survivor of the crash. After evading enemies, he meets up with a squad of Atlantic soldiers. The squad infiltrates a Pacifican bunker, but most of the members are killed shortly afterward. After fighting through the bunker alone, the player discovers HYDRABALLS, a new, highly explosive Pacifican weapon. After destroying a large number of the weapons, the player breaks through and takes an elevator to a secret underground facility, where the player locates and destroys key manufacturing equipment. After destroying the equipment, the player aids an allied squad in capturing the Golden Gate Bridge from Pacifican forces and fixing another bridge using multiple spike grenades. The Golden Gate Bridge is captured, but a giant, 1,000-foot-tall (300 m) machine called Dreadnought awakes from the Bay and destroys most of the Atlantic forces, then marches towards the East Coast invincible to aerial attack.\n\nThe player is taken out of San Francisco to a remote Pacifican base in the desert, where he is supposed to find information about destroying the Dreadnought. Along the way to the communications center the player fights a new enemy, the ground-burrowing Creepers, and shuts down the base's defense systems by destroying power generators. Brody also destroys both the radar systems and their generators, therefore knocking out all Pacifican communications. At this point in the game the player is required to use the Lodestone, a vortex-creating weapon, to solve platform puzzles by creating magnetic vortices. Also introduced are the super-fast Cheetah soldiers, who can move from place to place in the blink of an eye. Next Brody encounters a creature called the Bolla, a large minotaur-like monster that throws boulders and charges the player. After killing the Bolla Brody is given an Alliance vehicle, the TDV1, that has an automatic turret and terrain deformation powers. Using the TDV1, the player is supposed to jump large pits of toxic chemicals and destroy the base's supercomputer, while fighting Pacifican soldiers and another Bolla.\n\nAt this point the base's supercomputer goes on meltdown and starts destroying the base, just as the player receives another TDV1 to escape to a landing pad. Sheridan escapes, this time with some of the toxin, and locks a traitorous biologist, named Marico, in a prison cell guarded by a Pacifican squad. The player must destroy the Pacifican forces and rescue Matsuharo before proceeding to Washington, D.C. to destroy the Dreadnought and take down Sheridan. Another boss creature, the Spike Hydra that can create personal shields, is encountered as well as another Bolla as Brody brings the defense shields back online by connecting the generator beams together. Brody breaks the Dreadnought's shields and destroys it from the inside, then kills Sheridan in a final battle to destroy the Pacifican Army.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2008-10-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13194,"FileName":"c7aca46d-1fb7-4769-a97d-829e76f33e3b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13194,"FileName":"0febf4d3-1e2a-465c-a62a-a8eeb1137c96.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13194,"FileName":"0368b49e-88ea-4ec1-b6f8-95820c69b9be.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19686,"Name":"Frogger","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Enjoy the classic game Frogger, revitalized and brand spanking new on your Xbox 360.

Players can explore a 14.000 km² area of Northern America after the effects of global warming took place, rendering it desolate with abandoned cities, broken vehicles and almost no survivors. The goal is to win races, which provides fuel that can be exchanged for new vehicles. The game world is divided in nineteen separate zones that need to be unlocked by collecting stars – provided through winning career races. Up to 75 different types of vehicles can be unlocked during the course of the game. The vehicles can be modified with paint jobs and liveries.\n\nBesides the regular career races, which are restricted to a specific vehicle class like ATV, buggy or motorbike, challenges are another event type in the game. These include for example chasing a helicopter through the terrain or trying to touch other vehicles within a given time limit. Next to the races and challenges that can be accessed right away, the game also offers the ability to drive freely in each of the zones to explore the environment. This is further encouraged by having to locate new liveries, vista points, and doppler trucks that show the locations of all items. The terrain is dense and the appropriate vehicle needs to be selected to explore freely. There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.\n\nThe general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects.

The game was officially released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine.

Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game.\n\nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades.

Also included is a second DVD that explores the making of Gears of War with lead designer Cliff Bleszinski and his development team.\n\nAnointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.\n\nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them.\n\nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Epic Games","Publisher":"Microsoft","ReleaseDate":"2006-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16163,"FileName":"200f736f-8f6d-4aaf-b0ef-60a559f0af1a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13347,"Name":"Gears of War: Triple Pack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gears of War Triple Pack contains the original Gears of War, Gears of War 2, and the Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection, which includes the \"Road to Ruin\" campaign and 19 multiplayer maps.\n\nUnlike other shooters, Gears of War is all about teamwork in a big way.

Generally it is a two-player game, but this version supports up to four players online with teams of two playing against each other. A standard deck of 52 cards is used and they each receive a ranking, from ace (one point) to the three face cards (Jack, Queen King) worth ten points. The dealer deals ten cards to each player. Two piles are made in the middle: a discard pile (face-up) and the stock pile (face-down). Each turn players draw one card, from any pile, and also have to discard one card. The goal of the game is to score most points by forming melds (consists of sets and runs) and eliminating deadwood. A set is three or four cards of the same rank (three times a five for instance) and a run is three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order (four, five, and six of spades for instance). The useless cards that remain in the player's hand are the deadwood.\n\nThe game can be ended by a player who has a hand of sets and runs and the points value of the remaining deadwood totals equal or less than ten points. This is called knocking. Knocking is optional when the above requirements are met and required when the deadwood equals zero (called \"going Gin\"). At that moment the other player still has a chance to win. When a player announces to knock, he lays his hand out with the melds and deadwood separated. The other player can then reduce his deadwood by laying off any cards that fit into the first player's meld, thereby reducing his deadwood. A lay-off is not allowed when the first player went Gin. After that, the points are counted, along with different types of bonus scores.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and includes a tutorial to get familiar with the rules of Gin Rummy. The game supports the Vision camera. While playing cards can also be sorted manually to get a good overview.

The basic multiplayer was for instance extended with friends lists, leaderboards, and player invites. Besides the engine change, the graphics have been overhauled, and are typically high-definition revamps. A major addition to is a new single player mode called MI6 OPS. It features leaderboards and a large list of mission modifiers, including numbers of enemies, enemy and player health, rocket launchers, Golden Gun, enemy aggressiveness, etc. Players have a variety of single-person challenges ranked on a system of one to four stars depending on modifiers and player performance. There are four different styles of MI6 OPS objectives:\n\n    Assault - The player must fight and survive through an area to reach an extraction point.\n    Defense - The player downloads information from computer consoles, and must protect them from swarms of enemies.\n    Elimination - Defeat set numbers of enemies (number chosen by the player).\n    Stealth - Move through a level without alerting enemies.\n\nGoldenEye 007: Reloaded features local online split-screen (an homage to the original N64 Goldeneye) for up to four players, as well online multiplayer. There are numerous modes such as Golden Gun where the popular one-shot kill weapon is highlighted, You Only Live Twice where players have limited lives, and Detonator Agent which is a version of the classic kid's game Hot Potato, with bombs in place of potatoes, among others. Some modes are only available online, such as Heroes where one player on a team is stronger, faster, and deadlier than others or GoldenEye where teams fight over control of the GoldenEye satellite.\n\nLike the MI6 OPS mode, there are over a dozen modifiers that can be applied to matches, such as editing the radar or shutting it off completely, requiring headshots for successful kills, limiting score or lives, making grenades bouncy or sticky, preventing players from standing still for longer than three seconds and s","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd8jr1FbpxY?hd=1","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Eurocom Developments Ltd","Publisher":"Activision Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"e78669ae-71f8-4dcd-acc3-26d1b73bf244.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"4355aba7-07ad-4b63-b51a-e598c57b8c99.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"d1988111-0192-4dcb-80d9-1c38081d3d0a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"35db1ad4-c338-4ce3-85ef-e799f63194c6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"d7de84a5-ad91-4fec-9909-264ba480b280.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"a3a2f67f-fa6e-499e-86d0-80f7593f8768.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8337,"FileName":"f2e807f8-6ebe-42d8-82a7-f7314468c7cd.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8337,"AlternateName":"007 Golden Eye: Reloaded","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":181823,"Name":"Golf: Tee It Up!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Golf: Tee It Up! is a simulation of golf with a loose approach, with customizable characters similar to the Xbox avatars, powered shots, and the ability to apply an amount of aftertouch while the ball is in the air.

It was released on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on Microsoft Windows. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Set within the fictional Liberty City (based on New York City), the single-player story follows a war veteran, Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.[c] Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. Following its announcement in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated.[4] Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12699,"FileName":"02cd0c9b-26b2-4060-a9c7-3082db3f3181.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13353,"Name":"Grand Theft Auto V","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV.\n\nAmidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score.

The game also includes 20 songs, 15 of which are from the original movie.[1] It is the second game to be based on Grease, following 2010's Grease, which was partially created by the same developer.\nThe title's standard mode is \"Dance\" which has players mimicking motions that appear on the screen to music using either a PlayStation Move or Kinect (depending on the console). Only 15 of the game's 20 songs are available to dance to.[2] In multiplayer, players may complete head to head or perform a coop dance routine. One competitive mode exclusive to multiplayer is \"Challenge\", which has players performing a dance routine while also completing small tasks throughout the song, such as freezing in place for a set number of time.[3] Also available is Karaoke, which allows players to use a USB microphone or the built in mics on the PlayStation Eye or Kinect to sing the song as it plays. Up to eight players may play at once using \"Party mode\", in which two teams consisting of two singers and two dancers face off against each other. In all modes, players can earn a score multiplier by completing five or more pages with an \"Ok\" or higher rating, which increases the amount of points earned for a move.[4]\nPlayers can also unlock film clips and mini-games based on movie scenes to play, most of which don't involve the core aspect of dancing or singing. For example, the \"Thunder Road Race\" mini-game is a race course in which players use hand gestures to boost and steer their car in a head to head race with the computer.[2]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Music","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14291,"FileName":"3873eb7f-00bc-42c7-b3a9-8d99f4808044.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14291,"FileName":"28399f29-0163-48e0-959c-e4e44d321e22.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163671,"Name":"Greed Corp","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163671,"FileName":"cab0c5d2-42d8-431c-a581-bed8baf6c80e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10612,"Name":"Green Day: Rock Band","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Green Day: Rock Band is a music video game developed by Harmonix Music Systems, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts.

Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.\n\nBut of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.\n\nTo earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like \"Finish before Team Top Secret\" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.\n\nBesides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRYpOaFnY4U","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Codemasters","Publisher":"Codemasters","ReleaseDate":"2008-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"e7e14946-201e-4db2-977f-60d25300d865.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"485c929b-c6ce-41a3-83b4-e2a6d0550775.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"48173169-cb97-422c-9206-8f71947e1277.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"8eb2f54c-2e4e-4ffb-941d-4f8585670f6d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"f7fe4670-f97f-47d1-a856-e9d41e129bda.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"c161e738-6b45-4fd2-91b9-b7e930fb7af7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12783,"FileName":"becd8bc0-25a6-47b8-821d-0ee1c1e4d1d6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12783,"AlternateName":"Racedriver: GRID","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":17083,"Name":"GRID 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"GRID 2 is a racing game and the sequel to GRID.\n\nThe player is the supposed next star of the up and coming World Series Racing (WSR) League.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-jPzuZB114","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Music","Developer":"Neversoft","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7485,"FileName":"43610b30-85ea-46f5-b676-e0a91311accc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7485,"FileName":"30d6badb-a2c3-47e0-9d6a-7adac2ba8837.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7485,"FileName":"9f50e296-cd95-4495-afab-3fe1714f511d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7485,"FileName":"d8ef880f-6848-43cb-ae2e-a8836b150a33.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7487,"Name":"Guitar Hero II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Guitar Hero II, the follow-up to the PS2-only game Guitar Hero, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game.

Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.\n\nThe prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.\n\nSongs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault.\n\nThe game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release.

The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 on March 29, 2009 and on PlayStation 2 on April 14, 2009, with an Australian and European release in May 2009. Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.\n\nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals.[4] The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc.\n\nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock.

In line with the contemporary film productions, the 2010 game's storyline follows the first portion of the final novel in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. From a third-person 3D perspective, players explore perilous scenes detailed in the book, and engage in action-oriented battle using powerful blasts from their magic wands. Xbox 360 gamers with the Kinect camera-control system can also cast spells simply by waving their hands in magical patterns. Two players can team up in cooperative multiplayer, taking the roles of any of the three main characters. The video game adventure is set away from the familiar school grounds for the first time, following Harry, Ron, and Hermione on a run for their lives from the forces of Voldemort, who has come to control the governing Ministry of Magic, as well as the once-safe Hogwarts academy.\n\nGuiding the three young heroes, players travel to remote and dangerous locations in a desperate quest to destroy the Horcruxes, objects of great power that are the secret to Voldemort's immortality. Different objectives and battles are best won by using the various special abilities of each character, calling on them to work together to overcome each series of challenges. No longer mere students, sheltered from the dangers of the world of magic by Professor Dumbledore and their other wise and kind teachers, Harry and his friends must face ferocious monsters, grim Death Eaters, and powerful rival wizards who have allied with the Dark One. The game also features magical battles against monsters and villains from earlier Harry Potter books, offering players a chance to further hone their wand-wielding skills. The dangers of the Deathly Hallows are greater than any he has faced before, but surviving this first part of the final adventure is the only way to prepare \"The Boy Who Lived\" to meet his destiny, in an inevitable showdown against Voldemort when the story comes to its conclusion.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"EA Bright Light","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15654,"FileName":"7e7fe019-daa0-4060-a806-2d07bf3d85cf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":15654,"FileName":"dcc75370-fb60-4d90-8add-845eef5fa655.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15654,"FileName":"fae5afe0-4371-49d8-859e-b51a31c9e546.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":15654,"FileName":"f1adfdf7-06b1-499b-879f-5bc05a90a70b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15654,"FileName":"e8a20923-7c19-46e8-b425-3b8be48f0ef0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":15654,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte: Parte 1","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":8867,"Name":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Based on the upcoming Warner Bros.

Rowling and the film of the same name, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP, Nintendo DS, Wii,[1] Game Boy Advance and Mac OS X.[2] It was released in 2007 on 25 June in the U.S., 28 June in Australia and 29 June in the UK and Europe for PlayStation 3, PSP, PlayStation 2, Windows and the 3rd of July for most other platforms.[3]\n\nThe theme of the game is to explore Hogwarts and follow the story from the book and movie. EA encouraged fan participation in the development of this game, and worked with a fan council. The game returns to the sandbox style of the first three games rather than the action-oriented Goblet of Fire. Similar to any sandbox, Hogwarts is fully explorable most of the time, and there are \"discovery points\" that provide rewards to the player, which can be activated by completing side missions. Furthermore, there are battles between groups of students, as shown in the game trailer. This is the last Harry Potter game to be released on the Game Boy Advance.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"EA UK","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2007-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12519,"FileName":"bf7165c7-3288-4913-952a-209620888811.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12519,"FileName":"1da5f61b-2886-489a-9d9c-0524dc62fe45.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12519,"FileName":"ddf54c0e-d822-4c90-a411-e86eb15d7837.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12519,"FileName":"1660e53a-f933-44e0-b09c-6364526589e2.PNG","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":12519,"FileName":"1df9f1e5-f408-4e78-b2b8-eb69b2065523.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12519,"AlternateName":"Harry Potter y la Orden del Fenix","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":14114,"Name":"Harry Potter for Kinect","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"For the first time, create a witch or wizard character in your likeness that will become part of the gameplay through Kinect's scanning technology.\nExperience unforgettable moments from all eight films - from having your wand choose you at Ollivanders and being Sorted as a first-year student at Hogwarts, to battling You-Know-Who in a climactic wizard battle\nCast spells at your opponents by performing the proper casting maneuvers and calling out spell names utilizing Kinect's controller-free and voice recognition capabilities.\nHone your casting, brewing and duelling skills (among others) in class to unlock even more lessons and challenges\nChallenge a friend in competitive mini-games, or join forces against a mutual opponent in co-op games.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14114,"FileName":"0863ee84-4f79-4e01-ab34-9518e10f7369.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14114,"FileName":"68339c8a-93f8-46fd-afe9-a51393d93f92.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14114,"FileName":"6833b45a-cca7-4a14-84f2-e4c9fd719be1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14114,"FileName":"f73eab75-1257-4b10-ba06-3a8f9433101f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14114,"FileName":"eaba44f0-b68b-4d0e-93d9-2660a960a54e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15525,"Name":"Hasbro Family Game Night","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hasbro Family Game Night is a mini-game collection of conversions of Hasbro board games.

A free-to-play mobile app based on Injustice was also released for Android and iOS devices.\n\nPlayers select one of several characters from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent. The game is set in a 2.5D environment; while character models and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters are restricted to fight within a two-dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.\n\nThe storyline is set within an alternate version of the Justice League's universe. Superman establishes a new world order after the Joker tricks him into killing Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. In an effort to stop Superman, Batman summons members of the Justice League from the mainstream continuity to join his insurgency and end the totalitarian regime. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, gameplay mechanics, and use of the DC Comics license. Injustice became the highest selling game in the United States and United Kingdom during the month of its release. The game also won several awards for \"Best Fighting Game\" in 2013.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGRcblXDaJw","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"NetherRealm Studios","Publisher":"WB Games","ReleaseDate":"2013-04-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"0a98da02-4ede-416c-aaa3-cca9f027aff1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"8c328cbc-f3c0-4bd4-9a9b-675f3a61bf53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"386d607e-1164-4517-9ae5-90c01570ee68.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"01aa7744-f18a-4b0a-94d4-585fab082397.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"90b39747-c045-4052-a1c5-5b7e45fb7e23.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"5c8476c5-9d64-485b-8b58-c76f54a35d21.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"96d1f7b0-6b59-4eed-9fb5-b369efe2ad87.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"a2945e63-962e-498b-8bd9-c532b6057586.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"aaa22a95-6ca0-474e-9314-b60ede35a9a4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"5aa841a0-1212-4916-8526-3b1ecc8d35f7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"f0b8fba3-6a55-4359-991f-113a2c2b9467.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"2dc5dde3-d649-4faa-96ca-bd6efd45430d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"6a3f63ee-19e6-4abf-b2d0-b58f302f36e4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"61f16f3e-d176-499c-a839-105d04f54391.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"4d64d4ae-eb52-4667-8a79-68258ac1b6d7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"b417b314-305e-4929-8899-6b94a4074ce1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"e4767ab2-659d-449d-b707-293a7b933cb1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"6da7855f-d755-4bc7-8858-a2f16143b90c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"62efa1c0-58bb-4649-9fd0-6ca1b5004d31.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"5d519a45-0dca-491c-b103-bf2558830d6e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"f5a4e628-0c6a-4948-bef4-b5dc1472ba27.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"d670dd3c-7dd1-4da1-b42e-33e1d5f6655c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"2a1d602d-ed6d-421d-9b28-6868a3402c09.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"7e2d1735-b8c5-41b7-a8a5-af417275a8c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"e1b9e210-8e97-4ea2-87bd-b64a88397999.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"dab44e5d-2eb7-4ab5-8bca-8d712f4db6fb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"233d9e57-ca62-4b0f-a1d2-dffe09eacd5f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"589e1a81-5205-4a1e-9ea0-d7059ec943dc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"30bec8a4-fc63-4937-912e-fc5edc333cee.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"6214a0de-a1a0-443a-b6a8-b78d5233df25.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10391,"FileName":"8bea3660-deb0-4f97-bef5-95450775a791.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":173392,"Name":"Injustice: Gods Among Us: Ultimate Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting game from the creators of the Mortal Kombat series with characters of the DC universe.\n\nThe gameplay consists in a hand-to-hand fighting in a 2D gameplay with 3D elements and characters with some weapons like the Batmobile;

The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series.\n\nIt was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan?), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1]\n\nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities.\n\nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2012-08-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"245a0f3b-8673-456c-91df-e588f80c9c52.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"d470e64d-3ccd-4820-8f58-b355ba7b4bd3.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"8ab05c25-545c-4547-8578-18f7904b4d03.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"bebe5f06-c22a-4d65-8a82-4e796dc90467.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"ee01c839-bf4b-49a6-82a4-f10364252b15.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"c3040bef-9092-4fed-8f7b-409851d7c7e5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"22af0bcc-f7ff-47db-ad6d-e50207d550c7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15725,"FileName":"715a282f-41f6-4898-9401-06e6fa443dfa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":173356,"Name":"Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge","ReleaseYear":"2011","Overview":"Rugby video game, developed by Sidhe and published by Tru Blu Entertainment.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Sidhe","Publisher":"Tru Blu Entertainment","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":173356,"FileName":"fc10106f-fb63-4352-aa3d-3481863ab7c9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":173356,"FileName":"7919151b-8ea8-4435-b4d0-4283c4d39d27.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173356,"AlternateName":"All Blacks Rugby Challenge, Wallabies Rugby Challenge","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":20315,"Name":"Joust","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mount thy noble ostrich and ride forth into battle in the classic arcade game Joust!

In the introduction, she storms a castle to rescue her family members, but fails, and loses all her powers. Your task is to collect ten elemental spirits and defeat Thorn, the king of the trolls, along with your evil sister Kalus.\n\nThe game mixes action with exploring and basic puzzle-solving tasks. There are four themed areas, with friendly zones where you can shop and talk to the inhabitants. Next to the distinct zones, there are also Badlands to cross, where there is an ongoing battle between elves and trolls. The Enchanted Kingdom is your base, a hub from which you can access the different areas.\n\nBy collecting elemental spirits, Kameo can transform into ten different forms, each with their own abilities. Those are acquired by solving quests or defeating boss characters. As you progress in the game, you will need to make use of them to overcome obstacles. Some forms allow you to perform special attacks, link combos, or grant abilities such as swimming (Deep Blue), breathing fire (Ash), shooting torpedoes or use rock-like body parts to engage enemies (Rubble). Each form can be enhanced with different upgrades by collecting hidden pieces of fruit.\n\nDuring gameplay, you can access a hint book where Ortho offers hints. There is a cooperative mode for two players, both offline and online, and the music was done by an 80 piece orchestra.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"92fbf178-049b-442e-ad07-83204ceef1ff.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"ca018475-7028-4a34-92bf-88e77f480586.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"3a8c5fdd-5241-4a7a-be5a-abdffaab147c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"51c74122-517b-4a94-8832-cd678ad6aa39.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"9c73117f-c767-4c2f-8373-796ed5db5ebf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"e978790c-4eac-490f-a773-7d556605dd57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"55dcc702-238a-4d8a-9734-749adc22df57.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"be08df71-624c-42db-8c15-9e53c83ee3a8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"f524adeb-bf52-4599-b25b-cf840385d687.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"6d03f7a9-3768-4f83-b4d1-71f947264873.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7496,"FileName":"611e0faa-40ea-4fb7-a261-1a5865686703.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12506,"Name":"Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a 2010 third-person shooter video game developed by IO Interactive, published by Eidos Interactive under Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[1][2] It is the sequel to Kane & Lynch: Dead Men.\n\nAnnounced in November 2009, the game was described as having a new visual style inspired by documentary films and user-generated content.

All included games are simulations of real-life sports. There are three main game modes: a main event for one or two players locally or over Xbox Live, Party Play for multiple players in a single room, and Mini-Games where the included sports are presented with a variation in the gameplay. Not all games share the same free-for-all or cooperative options. For AI opponents the player can also determine the difficulty level. Party Play consists of variations of the main sports as well, for up to six players divided over two teams. A session generally lasts fifteen minutes with six rounds. A game is chosen by turning a wheel and then each team has to appoint a player to compete.\n\nThe included sports are:\nBeach volleyball\nTeams of two characters play games of beach volleyball in a race to reach seven points first, but only when there is a two-point difference. There are different serving options and the player can also jump and hit to smash or block. Extending an arm left or right in the direction of the team player is done to pass, build up an attack or return a ball. Passing can also be done with two hands for more accuracy and the game registers a small touch to land the ball close over the net. In the first mini-game you return balls on a field filled with distractions and in the second game you can only return the ball with a specific body part, highlighted on the screen. You have to return the ball with your head, feet or hands as indicated.\n\nBowling\nPlayers extend a hand left or right to pick up a ball and then swing it backwards and immediately forwards, releasing it on the lane. By stepping around and leaning in you can give the ball more momentum. Effect can be applied by crossing your arm over your chest after swinging. In the mini-games there is a survival mode where you need to hit all pins in a single throw, with different positions for each challenge. You can miss five times before the game is over. In the second mini-game you need to hit as many racks of pins as possible against a time limit, quickly picking up balls left or right. A new rack only appear when all pins have been thrown over.\n\nBoxing\nA boxing match is done from a see-through first-person perspective. Players can hit and block high and low and the game registers the strength of the punch. A game is won through a regular knockout, a technical knockout or a judges' decision. When you are knocked down yourself, you need to hit the stars circling above your head to get back up before the count reaches 10. Throwing punches wildly is discouraged as multiple blocks allow an opponent to counter with a hard strike.\n\nFootball\nIn this game of soccer players need to reach the opponent's goal through passes. When the ball is in possession different passing options are shown. The pass is given by kicking in one of the available directions, while the opponent can intercept by blocking the path or tackling. When close to the goal you can shoot. In a defending position you attempt to stand in the ball's path or perform a tackle. As the keeper you can sidestep and use your hands, feet or body to block the incoming shot. There is no free movement otherwise. The referee can award penalties and free kicks and calls a fault when the player takes too long to pass. Using a corner, a throw-in or a cross-pass into the center a style shot can sometimes be performed. There is a cooperative mode to play with another local player in your team taking turns whenever an action is performed. The two mini-games involve blocking many consecutive shots as a keeper or switching places and doing target shooting with a keeper in the goal.\n\nTable tennis\nGames of table tennis are played as singles or doubles. The first to reach eleven points wins, but only when there is a two-point difference. To serve players pick up the ball, throw it in the air and hit it. Returning the ball is done by extending the arm and swinging left or right. The strength and the direction of the shot is picked up. Effect can be applied by raising your arm up and down while returning to introduce topspin or backspin. In the first mini-game you have to return a constant stream of balls quickly and the second one is a rally that goes on until you miss.\n\nTrack and field\nThis event consists of multiple sports: Hurdles, Sprint, Javelin, Discus Throw and Long Jump. Each one is played using the motions you would perform in real-life. For instance while doing hurdles you need to actually run at a fixed position to gain speed and jump whenever you approach a hurdle. All of the events can be played one after another as a pentathlon. In the two running events there is a technique to gain extra boost while running.\nThe game incorporates the Show Off & Share functionality of Kinect Adventures. There is an option to allow Kinect to record video highlights of yourself while playing the game. These are shown when an event is finished. They can be shared locally or posted online to kinectshare.com - where it is possible to download the video to a PC or share them directly through Facebook.\n\nIn the singleplayer mode the player earns experience by competing in events. Certain amounts of points are rewarded with badges and avatar items.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12495,"FileName":"8fbb1a0b-0305-436b-8c2c-df44e15d952a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12495,"FileName":"f96f12ef-2a41-455e-96ff-a7fcaa75da4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12495,"FileName":"66b617ef-fa0d-4790-8ca9-aa55c6e8050b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12497,"Name":"Kinect Sports: Season 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kinect Sports: Season Two is the sequel to Kinect Sports.

The included sports are American football, baseball, darts, golf, skiing and tennis. Each game can be played in single-player or multiplayer (both offline and online) and also has a mini-game variant. In single-player there are opponents for three difficulty levels. Only the rookie difficulty level is available at the start and others need to be unlocked. By competing, fans are earned which acts as experience for a level system tied to the profile.\n\nSkiing is based on slalom where you need to pass gates and jump. Moving left and right is done through leaning. In baseball the gameplay consists of throwing passes to receivers based on different strategies selected before starting the play.

The game falls in line a bit with Nintendo's Nintendogs titles about playing with and taking care of virtual pets.

It also features light story elements focused on pirate treasure with various mysteries to solve on and about the island, Lemuria, on which the game takes place. A small flying character known as Bumble introduces the player to the game and various other elements, such as guidance on the story part of the game. Initially five cubs are available (Cheetah, Royal Bengal Tiger, Black Panther, African Lion and African Leopard), but later on six additional ones can be unlocked (Bornean Clouded Leopard, Serval, White Jaguar, Bobcat, Siberian Tiger and Saber-tooth Tiger). Additional ones can be added to the game through downloadable content and toy animals that come with scan codes that can be held up to the camera to redeem them. These are tied through game shops and a deal with Burger King for instance.\n\nBesides simply raising and petting a virtual cat, the player can also take part in mini-games with pets, as well as teaching them tricks. Mini-games involve some abstract ideas for a virtual pet, such as jumping rope and driving the pet around on a remote control car. Aside from the story elements, the game is very open-ended allowing players to experience the game, generally, however they want.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"","Developer":"Frontier Developments","Publisher":"Microsoft","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8872,"FileName":"d8ab4600-7fb5-43d0-be53-8d66a321df41.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8872,"FileName":"cc8fed1f-78ee-46ea-b5f4-9e08525491b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8872,"FileName":"73e0731a-eabe-4a49-b1a0-bdecefbae25c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8872,"FileName":"e19ad8cc-e84d-4971-903d-3f76065e8021.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14443,"Name":"Kinectimals: Now with Bears!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your family gets bigger in this extended release of Kinectimals.

The protagonist is Graham, the same protagonist who first appeared in the original King's Quest in 1984. The entire game is told as a flashback narrated by the old Graham to his granddaughter Gwendolyn, similar to the story structure of King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, set in a fantasy universe and with a humorous tone. When Graham dies in the game, he often rewinds the story a bit or remarks it was not what he did. His narration is also heard during regular gameplay, especially for descriptions of the environment. The game offers entirely new stories and characters, but they often reference the earlier games. The new stories are not told in a chronological order and they are interspersed with sections in the present that revolve around Gwendolyn.\n\nThe game environment is shown through different perspectives for each scene with scrolling parts, but the camera cannot be controlled. Visually it has a cel-shaded graphical style. The player can move Graham freely in the 3D environment. When he is close to an interesting element, this is signified through one or multiple icons in the bottom right corner of the screen. The player can choose to examine, interact or pick up. Collected items are stored in an inventory. In many locations it is possible to switch to a first-person perspective to examine the environment. The game largely focuses on the story and puzzle-solving, but there is also a large amount of exploration of the environment and action sequences with escapes and fighting. Graham often needs to run and he can also push or manipulate objects in various ways, which is more prominent than using items in the inventory. These sections are sometimes shown from a first-person perspective. There are also many cut-scenes, on-rails sequences and some Quick Time Events.\n\nThe game incorporates choices and consequences in various ways and they are carried across episodes. There are many branching dialogue options (without a timer unlike in many Telltale games) that lead to different outcomes. In addition, puzzles often have multiple approaches without a fixed solution. The game initially starts in a confined environment, but soon opens up with a large place to explore. The way Graham solves puzzles also has consequences, for instance by choosing to involve a specific character when this leads to a negative outcome. Generally there are three types of choices to make or paths to follow: bravery, wisdom or compassion, even though these are never mentioned explicitly. This affects the story and especially the way Gwendoline will act in the present as her grandfather's stories are the inspiration for her acts. These choices were sometimes also present in the early King's Quest game, for instance the way Graham could deal with the dragon in the first game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"The Odd Gentlemen","Publisher":"Sierra","ReleaseDate":"2015-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173451,"FileName":"a56ec6ac-33dc-43c0-be27-92fcce7d590f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12785,"Name":"Knights Contract","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A violent hack-and-slash title set in a medieval land ruled by spells and steel, Knights Contract has you guiding immortal executioner Henrich and resurrected witch Gretchen from a third-person perspective.

The game concept is largely identical, but while the first game was exclusive to the PS3 with the PlayStation Eye, this version is exclusive to the Xbox 360 and requires the Kinect peripheral to play. Just like the original game the Kinect capturing and tracking technology allows the player to star in a side-scrolling brawler. The main story campaign consists of fourteen levels, different from those in Kung-Fu: Live, where many enemies have to be defeated. The player's image, from head to feet, is shown in the game and kicks and punches are performed in real-time the way the players performs them in the room. Between levels there are comic-book like story sequences where the player's image is also incorporated by capturing a number of poses before the sequence. The plot is that the player is sucked into a Kung fu comic book.\n\nThe game recognizes jumps and blocking is also possible. A high attack is blocked by raising one arm in front of the face and a low attack by lifting one leg. Each move also propels the character forward slightly, to keep moving through the levels. Enemies block as well, encouraging the use of varied moves or jumps to get behind them. There are different special moves, for instance a power punch that makes the character travel across the entire screen by pushing out both hands while keeping them slightly apart. There is also a magic bow used to hit objects from a distance. Yellow warnings often appear for enemy moves, providing cues to dodge them by ducking or jumping. It is possible to scan custom objects to use them in the game, such as a baseball bat or a toy sword.

Players assume the role of four new \"Survivors,\" each with their own personality and new dialog. The game leads these \"Survivors\" through the southeastern region of the US - from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans’ French Quarter.\n\nGameplay\nJust as with the original Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. As you would expect in a scenario where you are regularly surrounded by masses of the undead, it is very good thing to have plenty of help, as well as weapons at your disposal, and Left 4 Dead 2 has players covered on both accounts. The game features several multiplayer options including 2-8 player online and offline (via system link) support in several modes seen in the first game, including Campaign, Versus, and Survival, as well as the new Scavenge Mode. This new multiplayer option tasks players, in the role of survivors to find a limited number of fuel canisters hidden in a level in order to keep their individual generators going, while other players in the role of the infected try to stop them. In addition the game features very strong co-op play support, with 2-player support locally and 2-4 player support online.\n\nThe game features a wealth of melee weapons and additional items handy for battling enemies up-close and personal. Along with melee weapons seen in the first game, players can look forward to wielding new weapons like axes, chainsaws, frying pans, etc. Firearms are also available, but seeing as zombie fighting usually requires a little elbow grease, melee weapons are the mainstay. In addition, players can carry other useful items, including a variety of throwing weapons and several different kinds of support items, like flashlights to startle enemies and light the way in dark environments and healing items like first aid kit and defibrillator kits.\n\nCustomize with AI Director 2.0\nIntroducing the AI Director 2.0, Left 4 Dead 2's dynamic gameplay is taken to the next level by giving the Director the ability to procedurally change weather effects, world objects, and pathways in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match the players' performance.

However, instead of a technically superior Nazi army swarming into Gotham, mythological creatures have been unleashed onto the landscape by small time art thief Charles Deckard, who decided to take a peek inside his latest target: Pandora's box. The resulting pandemonium finds players controlling Deckard through the midst of a three-sided conflict between rival secret societies and beasts such as werewolves, minotaurs, gryphons, and golems. The Council of 98 and the Black Order both seek the power of Pandora's box for different reasons, while the monsters attack everyone and wreak havoc on the destructible environments.\n\nHaving been marked with The Signet, denoting that only he can re-seal Pandora's box, Deckard must travel from New York to London, and on to Durham, England, to restore peace to the world. The Signet allows him to draw health from fallen creatures and perform an attack that repels all nearby foes, but he must rely on grabbing ammunition from dead soldiers, and his weapons are standard pistols, shotguns, and rifles. Multiplayer modes include a standard four-on-four deathmatch, with players controlling the Black Order or the Council of 98 while the creatures lurk hungrily in the background, and a hunting mode that lets gamers try to kill as many creatures as possible within a given time limit.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Spark Unlimited","Publisher":"Gamecock Media Group","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"78c39710-0dda-40e2-bbab-58a1bac75852.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"a586a577-b120-43b5-8564-3d36d0224f11.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"56e068b1-a854-47ac-98be-1782f616539e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"4c6f10b0-5f4e-4b53-85ad-96e128ef0b8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"62a6f4b9-0d64-4a1b-a3df-643ee74914cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"04c10091-384d-4761-8f17-9dfd2ffb87db.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"ad0c0182-a062-48fa-8c27-384dd3c8fd1b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":12811,"FileName":"acda8a6e-4177-4376-8a97-63e27c7a5fa4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12565,"Name":"LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is an Action-Adventure game set within the Batman universe, and filled with LEGO versions of heroes and villains from the Batman comic series, working together/against those from the Justice League comic series.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoOmSrrUsz8","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Traveller's Tales Ltd.","Publisher":"WB Games","ReleaseDate":"2012-06-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12565,"FileName":"55bef856-b2b1-468d-b9f4-a233b7c3942e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12565,"FileName":"f64cee96-a945-41cd-af28-76282c0b9280.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12565,"FileName":"956e5288-87d9-4f0b-b7be-48afd8d9442b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22680,"Name":"LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The best-selling LEGO Batman videogame franchise returns in an out-of-this-world, action-packed adventure!

Almost all of the game takes place inside Hogwarts.\n\nThe Story mode is broken up into four years with six chapter per year. When you first play story mode you are required to play as certain characters that are part of that story and you cannot choose any character from the entire series. But once you beat that chapter a Free Mode is unlocked, allowing you to pick any unlocked character and replay that story. All story chapters and years can be accessed in The Leaky Cauldron which acts as the central hub in the game. The entire environment allows for continuous play and most places can be revisited at any time. Many of the characters' interactions change however based on the time of year, or when certain characters are introduced such as the Dementors or Gilderoy Lockhart.\n\nOutside of The Leaky Cauldron is Diagon Alley. In Diagon Alley you can head to other stores to obtain items and supplies. At Madam Malkin's Robes you can spend all of your hard earned studs (the currency) to buy new characters. At Eeylops Eye Emporium you can head upstairs and buy Red Bricks which contain cheat codes of sorts to use. And at Wiseacre's Wizarding Supplies you can buy fun new spells to cast on anybody you like. Casting spells is an important part of the gameplay and is accessed by a spell wheel in which you can choose many ranging from Wingardium Leviosa to the dreaded Aveda Kedavra (only the three versions of Voldemort can use this).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

As with many other Tt Games titles it adapts a licensed franchise to a world built up out of LEGO bricks. The game consists of 20 levels, five for each of the movies, played in succession. The game borrows many iconic moments from the films using the original audio clips and often adds a humorous twist.\n\nThe game uses the typical gameplay where each level is played with a different group of characters that smash objects and solve environment based puzzles, often by switching between characters to use specific abilities. These include digging, cutting through foliage, gliding, climbing up walls, grappling, interacting with technology panels, scanning tracks, shooting targets, examining dung, grow vegetation, shatter glass, taking pictures, opening locks and more. There are over 100 characters to unlock, including 20 playable dinosaurs also with specific abilities. The short dinosaur sections allow the player to take the 'villain' side similar to the way it was done in LEGO Batman: The Videogame and there quick time event battles against other dinosaurs. Once again local cooperative games are possible with a second player able to join through a drop-in drop-out system (not for Vita). Mr. DNA often appears as a helper to explain what to do next.\n\nAs in some of the previous games it is possible to assemble new objects out of the bricks, but without the complexity of the way it was done in The LEGO Movie Video Game. The game introduces a weather system that affects the environment. As with previous titles some parts of the levels are locked off until the correct character or dinosaur is unlocked, often by reaching a certain level. The additional characters then introduce new abilities to progress or ways to find hidden items. As with previous games after completing levels they can be replayed in a free play mode with different characters and free exploration in large hub locations, with additional unlockables. The hub worlds change dynamically by completing story levels, introducing new locations. In the free play mode custom characters can be used, either unlocked by finding their character token or by reaching a certain levels and buying them in exchange for an amount of LEGO studs collected during gameplay as a currency. Similarly unlocked vehicles can be purchased and used as well.\n\nThe island hubs can be populated with dinosaurs by locating a piece of amber with a mosquito inside, hidden in each of the 20 story mode level. Both characters and dinosaurs can be customized, and for dinosaurs DNS strains can be mixed to create genetic hybrids. As with the previous titles red bricks can be collected. These can be sold at Holoscape terminal to unlock new abilities.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"TT Fusion Ltd.","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

As with all TT LEGO adaptations there is also a large amount of humour.\n\nThe Gameplay is similar to previous LEGO Star Wars games where players interact in a LEGO-themed Star Wars universe filled with action, platforming, and puzzle-solving. Over 200 playable characters are available in this game, including Rey, Kylo Ren, Finn, Captain Phasma, Poe Dameron, BB-8, and many more. Each player has their unique abilities for completing the various puzzles you will encounter throughout the campaign, including new ways to incorporate droids and Jedis into these challenges. For example, some droids will manipulate the hardware for moving platforms to allow the other player to advance.\n\nThe levels also alter in theme, from areas relying heavily on the game's platform, puzzle-solving mechanics to large spaceship battles to cover-based shootouts during combat against stormtroopers. The hub world is a galaxy in which each planet is its own world with the chapters, as well as additional missions, some of which add to the storyline of the Star Wars universe, bridging the events between the original trilogy and the sequels, as previously mentioned.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"TT Fusion","Publisher":"Warner Bros.","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173479,"FileName":"466de963-568a-4784-99da-51adff08d452.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":173479,"FileName":"62095163-f7b6-474e-bc48-19a2af18c6fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173479,"FileName":"beda7583-42b4-4c2f-b011-a9d640f84746.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":173479,"FileName":"00f895f7-02ad-464a-b6ff-b024306d7bdc.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":173479,"AlternateName":"LEGO Star Wars: El Despertar de la Fuerza","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":22681,"Name":"LEGO The Hobbit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From the makers of the immensely popular LEGO® The Lord of the Rings, comes LEGO The Hobbit, inspired by the first two films inThe Hobbit Trilogy: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and the upcoming The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, productions of New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures (MGM) as well as the collection of LEGO The Hobbit constructions sets.

Much like the popular past time of karaoke, players sing along to the lyrics of songs that are displayed on-screen. The game also judges you based on pitch, earning you points based on how accurately you sang. At certain points in the game, players are prompted to perform gestures with the microphone (such as tilting it upwards). When they do this, the bonus 'Star Stream' mode is activated which earns even more points.\n\nLips can be played in either Solo, VS, or Co-Op modes. At any time during solo play, a second player can shake their wireless mike to create a multiplayer game. VS mode is a battle for the highest score, while Co-Op has players working together to achieve a high score. If both players trigger Star Stream simultaneously in co-op, their star bonuses are doubled.\n\nThere are also special game modes for those who want to try something different: in Kiss, the on-screen couple gets closer together the better that both players sing. When they get close enough, you'll be prompted to tilt your mikes up to make them kiss. Time Bomb lights a bomb's fuse at the start of the song. By singing well, you'll fill a glass up with water - when there's enough water inside, use it to extinguish the fuse.\n\nPlayers who don't want to sing can still participate by using a controller as a Noise Maker. This allows them to add sound effects such as snapping fingers, cowbells, tambourines and even crowd noise to the song.\n\nThe song list is localized for different countries, with certain tracks only included in the version for specific regions. Below is the main track list that is largely shared across versions. An overview of the localized differences can be found through the related links section.\nAce of Base - The Sign\nAlicia Keys - No One\nAvril Lavigne - Complicated\nBen E.

In addition to purchasing new songs from Xbox Live Marketplace, you can also plug in your MP3 player or place in a CD and import tracks to your console's hard drive. You can also send the track information to Microsoft to let them know that you want this song to be added as an official downloadable song and help them choose which songs turn up on Marketplace next.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":" Music","Developer":"iNiS","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13091,"FileName":"ffd18193-5284-4652-b1d3-857f9bf925a5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13091,"FileName":"34566ff0-d3ff-4307-9047-da5ee08ddf15.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":13091,"FileName":"eda61d1d-aca0-47b8-afae-d79f25459ee2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":13091,"FileName":"50d6ec1f-230e-4f7e-ba93-9ac73f787570.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13091,"FileName":"733628f2-9d9a-42af-aa65-fa1054a8e7fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13093,"Name":"Lips: I Love the 80s","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"I ♥ the 80s is the fourth main game in the Lips karaoke series and it was released only one month after the previous game, Lips: Party Classics.

The visuals have been slightly overhauled, which is most apparent in the menus, with different themes. Largely the same modes are supported, along with the ability to sing long or short versions of the songs. There is a singleplayer mode, and multiplayer with versus, co-op and a number of mini-games. Players have to sing along with lyrics on the screen using a microphone to fill empty bars, along with pitch and timing lines to get it right, while a video plays in the background. Songs can never be failed, players just receive less points. The real music videos are supported, along with custom, animated ones. Points are awarded based on accuracy. This builds a meter that can be used to unleash a Star Scream. When it's available you tilt the microphone and all lines are filled with stars. You can then fill them with your voice.\n\nThe motion controls are still used when your avatar (or a silhouette if you have none) turns up in between verses. They show a motion such as moving their hands in the air or playing a guitar and you have to mimic it. You move the microphone as if you're playing the instrument. There are some new moves such as clapping to the beat in time.\n\nJust like the previous games the series' sensitive wireless microphones are supported, but for the first time regular USB microphones can be used as well, from Rock Band or Guitar Hero for instance. With those, avatar movements, mini-games and percussions instruments are not supported, as those peripherals are not motion sensitive. Importing custom songs in the Freestyle mode from a USB device is also still possible.\n\nThe disc-swapping mechanism to import songs from other Lips titles is still retained. Those songs can be imported by swapping the disc in-game. The only improvement is that the original disc does not need to be reinserted after every song anymore. Once Lips: Number One Hits has been inserted for instance, you can continue singing songs from that disc without having to swap back constantly. The mic tutorial makes a return, to making syncing the microphones easier.\n\nNew to the series is the performance viewer. Any performance can now be saved to watch again afterwards. The Jukebox mode has been removed and it is replaced with the ability to make a playlist from the main menu.\n\nThe 40 songs ranging from 60's up to the 90's included on the disc are:\n4 Non Blondes - What's Up\nAlannah Myles - Black Velvet\nAmy Winehouse - Rehab\nAqua - Doctor Jones\nBlack Eyed Peas - Let's Get It Started\nCameo - Word Up\nChumbawamba - Tubthumping\nDeBarge - Rhythm of the Night\nDeee-Lite - Groove Is in the Heart\nDivinyls - I Touch Myself\nDon McLean - American Pie\nDusty Springfield - Son of a Preacher Man\nForeigner - I Want to Know What Love Is\nGloria Gaynor - I Will Survive\nJames - Laid\nJames Blunt - You're Beautiful\nKiss - Rock and Roll All Nite\nLynyrd Skynyrd - Sweet Home Alabama\nMaroon 5 - She Will Be Loved\nMr. Big - To Be With You\nNancy Sinatra - These Boots Are Made For Walking\nNew Order - True Faith\nOpus - Live is Life\nPercy Sledge - When a Man Loves a Woman\nPoison - Every Rose Has Its Thorn\nR.E.M. - Shiny Happy People\nRight Said Fred - I'm Too Sexy\nRobert Palmer - Addicted To Love\nSixpence None The Richer - Kiss Me\nThe B-52's - Love Shack\nThe Cure - Friday I'm in Love\nThe Knack - My Sharona\nThe Pretenders - Brass in Pocket\nThe Righteous Brothers - Unchained Melody\nThe Spice Girls - Wannabe\nTiffany - I Think We're Alone Now\nTom Jones - It's Not Unusual\nUB40 - Red Red Wine\nVillage People - Y.M.C.A.\nWhitesnake - Is This Love","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Music","Developer":"iNiS","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2010-03-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13092,"FileName":"e2b5f9bb-e49f-4d7b-b188-d483ce6c3204.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":13092,"FileName":"119b9516-04f2-45f6-8d7d-d8d03198fa8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":13092,"FileName":"03eb5649-35ea-43fc-8434-eb5fe662e4c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13092,"FileName":"faccfe0c-f7bf-4c14-8169-cd9986712983.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":13092,"FileName":"00ff6037-46bc-4a14-86c5-966972a32611.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":155669,"Name":"Lode Runner","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"On January 7, 2008, a remake of Lode Runner, developed by Tozai and Southend Interactive, was announced at CES '08, and was released on April 22, 2009.

While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. The kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat.

The basic idea of the game is to shift and align 2x2 squares of colored tiles into a wide bin. When you create a square or rectangle 2x2 or larger of the same color, the panels will highlight. Any highlighted panels are cleared by a constantly sweeping line that passes from left to right across the game area. Clearing multiple panels in one sweep will earn you bonuses, but it will be game over if you reach the top of the bin and try to place another square on top.\n\nDuring gameplay, the music will play according to the moves you make; such as square rotation, dropping squares, clearing tiles, and more. This gives the illusion of a blend of music and gameplay. Lumines Live! includes several different modes of play - some from the original Lumines, some new. Familiar modes include:\nChallenge Mode: Play an endless game, earning new skins as you progress.\n\nSkin Edit Mode: Play a short or endless game, choosing from one (or more) of your favorite previously unlocked skins from Challenge Mode.\n\nVS CPU Mode: Face off against the CPU in trying to claim the most play area.\n\nTime Attack Mode: Try to clear the most tiles in a set period of time.\n\nPuzzle Mode: Try to make specified shapes using the provided tiles.\nNew to Lumines Live! is Mission Mode.

It uses different numbering in the series to mark the 25th anniversary of the series, but it largely a regular incremental upgrade in content.

This yearly update includes the usual graphical tweaks, the full roster update and a number of new features. It retains the balance of managing, coaching and playing teams in both single-player and multiplayer.\n\nThe most notable addition is the ability to play as the owner of a team in the Connected Franchise mode. Previously it was already possible to customize and be a player or a coach, with 32 players simultaneously online, and now the larger overall management is added. The game offers both fictional and real-life personalities. You still need to gain experience by taking on various challenges, but you also need to take care of a media strategy, the price of merchandise, finances, staff and possible re-location. Most existing game mode return in an enhanced and tweaked form, such as the Madden Ultimate Team where the online season is combined with a trading-card game.\n\nThe game uses an upgraded Infinity Engine to manage the fluidity of players animations, team artificial intelligence and physics. The controls are tweaked with the addition of a run free mechanic where various modifiers such as jukes, spins, dives, stiff arms and trucks can be pulled off. These modifiers are based on the individual players' statistics. They make movement less linear and can be combined into combos to achieve larger runs. As a new addition the game offers various practice modes for it. On the defense it is now possible to lock on to enemy ball carriers to make tackling easier in an open field.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"EA Tiburon","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":17650,"FileName":"ce0e12b4-9240-42c4-8b81-23196751fca7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17650,"FileName":"38b27303-1956-4e74-9e78-e4d278c9752d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17650,"FileName":"83de64df-8496-49cb-9986-2b9e0aa65619.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15830,"Name":"Madden NFL Arcade","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Madden NFL 10 is an American football video game based on the National Football League that was published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon.

Juto sets out to take a revenge and joins up with the Southern Forces' Counter Sentinel Unit to find the man who is responsible for Melissa's death.\n\nCombat sequences are initiated seamlessly in the environment and rely on a stamina and combo system. The player can create combos and change characters to chain together larger, more powerful attacks. During attacks a stamina meter is filled. Stamina is a base statistic that allows for a certain number of attacks before putting the character into an overheat state, although it is also possible to simply hold off attacking and let the stamina recharge to allow for more attacks. When in Overheat, players should initiate a chain by switching to another character. By timing the character switches carefully, this effect can be negated and much longer combos can be chained, resulting in larger amounts of damage on enemies and the ability to use a number of special attacks.\n\nDefeating monsters is rewarded with Kamonds. These are used to power up weapons and create new items when a new recipe has been bought or discovered.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/vni5GtiQV0k?t=4","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"287384e7-2edf-4978-8c4c-e106aa5bde54.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"078059f7-316f-4c54-8dae-6522b68f4a71.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"72ae0ef3-e97c-4783-8428-30e82f23028d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"70f45460-0822-4d55-b8d1-281bd2c24730.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"3726be47-e764-4818-81bb-aff8d6a6a9be.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"13693555-82d3-4b6c-b62e-065831274a7d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"be2d0296-06d3-46d5-a449-c00005613f83.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"c5c976d8-f82c-4767-9173-66a7dafae660.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"0440173d-d568-4983-b654-2490c70a5915.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11997,"FileName":"1bedfccb-2cdc-4f19-b858-767b346f2534.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15834,"Name":"Mahjong ★ Dream C Club","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Machi-ing Maker 4 is a Strategy game, developed and published by D3Publisher, which was released in Japan in 2011.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-03-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15834,"FileName":"d0a44f11-d30b-47de-aa55-5427de519ffa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2263,"Name":"Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"To Save the Kingdom, the Greatest Alliance Between Man and Monster is Forged!\nMajin and the Forsaken Kingdom™ is the modern incarnation of inspired partnership gaming, seamlessly integrating problem solving, combat and an engaging story line in a fluid cinematic experience like no other!\n\nKey Game Features\n\n    Forge an alliance – Partner with the powerful monster to cooperatively battle the forces of darkness and creatively solve massive puzzles\n    Discover a whole new world – Journey though the mysterious fallen empire full of adventure, creatures and puzzles and seamlessly explore the lush forsaken kingdom\n    Diverse gameplay action – Experience the perfect gameplay mix combining stealth action, problem solving, platform navigation and combat\n    Legendary developer talent – Directed by Yoshiki Okamoto, whose previous works – Resident Evil and Street Fighter II series have reached critical acclaim and sold millions","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Game Republic","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2263,"FileName":"ec085afc-c454-4e69-b57c-f6c618a36b95.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2263,"FileName":"416d26b6-541c-4196-8f8d-bc55fa7537f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2263,"FileName":"5a11adb8-f33a-443a-abb6-272a795c8e20.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2263,"FileName":"4f5b5be9-1d89-40ed-ac92-f0b2333667e8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15838,"Name":"Major League Baseball 2K10","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Major League Baseball 2K10 or, in short, MLB 2K10, is an MLB licensed baseball simulation video game published by 2K Sports.

Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.\n\nSome heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team.\n\nYou explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes.\n\nBoss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.\n\nThe game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHM0Yq-WvC8","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T -

Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of \"Citadel space\". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the \"First Contact War\" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization. Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various planets, moons and other destinations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqJuJTIus7U%3Frel%3D0&hd=1","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Role-Playing; Shooter","Developer":"BioWare","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"c49bfafd-a26b-4f76-ba0b-332c474e2eb8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"3e32f4c2-0add-4728-9a90-752c6f032a79.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"18798261-4c46-436f-b0f9-d9bcac487ffe.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"330d26b8-99f6-4056-8748-dd380c5c0c4d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"34215f93-06f9-4e07-840a-53e61b176f79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"787524d9-4f1e-472c-9eb8-64a0ccdd36d2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"82dfbc4b-8b40-49c1-8cd9-3db111c5efae.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7535,"FileName":"f9f77c51-5719-4b26-b7c8-9b9846b09b72.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12787,"Name":"Mass Effect [Platinum Hits]","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The heroism of one brave human being could have a massive effect on the entire galaxy, in this original sci-fi RPG from BioWare.

However, it may very well be those human ties to a more primal nature that ultimately save all the space-faring species from destruction.\n\nBuilt on a third-generation version of the Unreal game engine, Mass Effect features real-time combat, in which players take limited command of a three-soldier squad. Decisions made by the hero, both in the heat of battle and in sophisticated role-playing sequences, will affect many details and may even influence the final outcome of the plot. Mass Effect is intended as the first of a trilogy of Xbox 360 games from BioWare. Between the launches of each full game in the series, the developer intends to release additional levels, side-stories, and other Mass Effect material through the Xbox Live service.\n\nThe two-disc Platinum Hits edition bundles BioWare's award-winning game with its \"Bring Down the Sky\" expansion, and includes a \"making of\" documentary, musical selections, artwork, and original trailers.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"BioWare","Publisher":"Microsoft","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12787,"FileName":"9dd6b461-3863-44d6-aa25-7e9893db31d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12787,"FileName":"1b25c439-f82c-4f8f-81d9-9330a574c5e5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7536,"Name":"Mass Effect 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After the events of the original game, Commander Shepard is killed in an ambush by a mysterious alien species called the Collectors.

The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the \"figure 8\" shaped course is a staple of the race.

Airborne also features a multiplayer mode available for online play, where users have the choice of fighting for the Allies and parachuting down to the battlefield, or fighting for the Axis and starting on the ground, defending the position from enemy paratroopers.\n\nThe game uses a massively improved version of Unreal Engine 3.[9] Airborne employs a nonlinear gameplay style whereby the player can start the game anywhere in the map by directing where they land, as opposed to previous linear FPS games where the start point and direction is already laid out, such as Allied Assault.[10]","MaxPlayers":"12","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbca7C_ObRc","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Electronic Arts Los Angeles","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"0c9b3999-9047-4f11-be85-9ad1db8a756d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"6d69c10b-a77d-4497-8038-9c28a478930f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"3d0c5f6e-d7dc-4775-92b3-edcdb3201053.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"d5ffb98d-5eaa-43ea-8740-183d925d599d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"f68cfbb5-c7f2-4c52-9c67-ee346c1bd265.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"69c7219c-c6bd-4218-ab16-e312c26cc5aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"45a81cc4-15b6-4643-930b-4c7faeb68746.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"9f8d45a1-a370-4af9-b92b-65f69242b991.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"ce922b6c-b4ab-460b-8c83-2e0f07569bea.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"92b1c60d-4334-4b5f-acf5-1a0688cba7bd.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7537,"FileName":"881bf734-2f79-4709-b55d-7d57931c7932.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12748,"Name":"Medal of Honor: Warfighter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A direct sequel to EA's 2010 franchise reboot, Medal of Honor: Warfighter once again puts Xbox 360 gamers in the role of elite Tier 1 operators as they battle the world's most dangerous terrorists in places like the Philippines, Bosnia, and Somalia.

The game introduces Raiden as the central character; a child soldier transformed into a half-man, half-machine cyborg ninja, equipped with a high-frequency katana blade and a soul fueled by revenge. In the near future, cyborg technology has become commonplace throughout society. Three years have passed since the collapse of the Patriots system that had been secretly controlling the global power balance from the shadows. However, peace remains elusive. The dissemination of cybernetic technology has triggered instability and conflict as those who control the trade gain increasing power. Furthermore, large 'Private Military Companies', or PMC's, that had been supported and controlled by the Patriots have collapsed, spawning countless rogue entities with origins to larger criminal organizations. These renegade PMCs employing cyborg technology have become increasingly more disruptive shifting policy and power at will. As a member of the peace-keeping PMC 'Maverick Security', Raiden lives by the mantra of protecting and saving lives.

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K_l8U61OpA","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Stealth","Developer":"Kojima Productions","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12304,"FileName":"bcc30b25-d4c6-4f18-a9af-7ed3c0f340fe.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12304,"FileName":"aacf0dca-cc08-45a5-b04f-39780bee3fd0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12304,"FileName":"c93f9b92-6050-456e-a417-22407d4e13f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19782,"Name":"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is an upcoming action-adventure stealth video game developed by Kojima Productions and produced by Konami.

Previously announced as Metro 2034,[2] the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length.\n\nInitially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012;[3] it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver.\n\nMetro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.\n\n\nust like the original game Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played from the perspective of Artyom, the player-character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above ground.\n\nAs a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light features a variety of firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player will use in combat. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and the player fighting hostile humans. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The game features recharging health rather than a traditional health points system—if the player avoids taking damage for a period, health will slowly recharge. The player can speed up this process by using a stim from a medkit, which will almost instantly heal the player to full health. When the player is severely injured, it may take over twenty seconds to return to full health. Health does not regenerate on, or above the \"Hardcore\" difficulty.\n\nIn the post-apocalyptic environment, ammunition is a rare and essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse military-grade ammunition is used as currency; to avoid \"shooting money\", the player can also use lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and items. The military-grade ammo can be used to purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations.\n\nThe game's locations reflect the dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and noises are frequent, and, for the most part, the player has to rely on their rechargeable flashlight (and sometimes, a pair of night-vision goggles) to find the way around in otherwise total darkness. Even more lethal is the surface, as it is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air.[5] Often, locations have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map, leaving the player to try to find their objectives with only a compass.\n\nAs Metro: Last Light aims to be immersive, the gameplay and interface are somewhat atypical. The game lacks a health meter, relying on audible heart rate and blood spatters on the screen to show the player's current state of health. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask, which last several minutes each and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. There is no heads-up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail—rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The gas mask can become visibly damaged and will stop functioning if punctured, requiring it to be replaced. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammo and they have to reload. The game does feature sparse traditional HUD elements, such as an ammunition indicator. However, on the hardest difficulty setting, no HUD elements are present, and players have to keep track of ammunition by the partly visible magazines.\n\nThere are also certain moral choices in the game that give Karma. Good Karma can be acquired by good actions, such as rescuing people from the enemy characters. Bad Karma can be acquired from evil actions, such as killing people randomly or stealing things.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"4A Games","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":"2013-05-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15878,"FileName":"7325fb7b-3349-4701-a018-295fbd87b7c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15878,"FileName":"fad81147-6a34-453d-a89c-e5184466b91f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15881,"Name":"Metro: Last Light: Limited Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013.[1] PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014.\n\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books.

Beck is a combat robot and the latest in the Mighty Numbers line, and the only among them able to manipulate Xels, the nanomachines that all robots are comprised of. Thus, he is asked by his creator, Dr. White, to bring the other Mighty Numbers back to their senses and discover the source of the robot affliction.\n\nGameplay is heavily inspired by the Mega Man series, and consists of running and gunning across platform levels while defeating enemies along the way. Beck's basic weapon is fairly weak, but once he has sufficiently damaged an enemy, he can dash into them to instantly defeat them and absorb their Xels. Each enemy has a different type of Xel, which can grant Beck temporary power-ups such as healing or increased defense. After defeating another Mighty Number in a boss battle, Beck may also use their unique Xels to transform and gain new weaponry. Call is also available in co-op play; while she cannot absorb Xels, she falls slower, dashes farther, and has a shield that absorbs projectiles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Abstraction Games","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35281,"FileName":"d113c39a-8965-4a38-847d-cd5982a1170f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15900,"Name":"Military Madness: Nectaris","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Military Madness: Nectaris is a turn-based strategy game and in design it largely stays true to the concept of the original game Military Madness. The player commands different squads of up to eight units on a battleground shown from above. During a turn, they can be moved around (shown as a grid of hexagonal tiles) and be issued orders. Squads can engage those of the opponent or capture buildings. Most of the matches are won when all enemies are defeated or the base camp has been captured. There is no fog of war, the entire battlefield is visible at all times.\n\nBuildings such as factories are important to control as they provide control over all squads inside, even if those belonged to the enemy. When a squad is ordered inside, the units are replenished to eight again, regardless of the amount that entered. Movement is based around four types: move-attack, move-attack-move, move or attack, and static. Strategically planning movement is important to control the battlefield, as a unit's hex establishes a zone of control of six surrounding hexes. When an opponent enters your zone of control, movement is immediately halted. A guide function is used to show all possible options for movement, range and attack.\n\nDuring a fight the game switches to a 3D side view showing all armies. Both sides fire at the same time, so there is no advantage in attack or defence. Instead, the squad's rank, type and amount of units largely determines the outcome. Additionally zone of control can be applied to overlap all six hexes adjacent to the opponent, cutting attack and defense in half. When an additional nearby squad is also adjacent, it will provide attack support. The same goes for defense, but there the support bonus decreases when units are lost during the battle. These are considered direct attacks. Indirect attacks from non-adjacent hexes are also possible, but then the bonuses do not apply and retaliation is not possible.\n\nThere are both ground and flying squads and the first can receive a defensive bonus based on the type of terrain. The squad type also determines retaliation, e.g. tanks cannot return fire to flying units and artillery cannot retaliate against tanks. Taking good care of successful squads is important to improve their rank up to eight times, enhancing their success in combat. In addition to regular movement there are mules and pelicans that can transport certain squad types more swiftly across the battlefield.\n\nNext to the single-player campaign this release contains multiplayer for up to four players. Multiplayer comes with a turn limit, ending the game even if the victory conditions have not been met. There is also a personal timer for each player per turn, and points are earned to compare scores and rankings on a global leaderboard. Unique to the multiplayer mode is the commander unit. Commanders have access to different abilities determined by the player by spending five points before starting a game. The choices are not seen by the other players until the game starts. They provide vehicle upgrades or support abilities. The first make the commander a dangerous unit in combat, while the latter for instance affect squads in its radius in various ways. Squads of the opponents are not affected by them. All abilities are available in local and player matches, but in online ranked matches only ten are available initially and the others need to be unlocked by ranking up. To speed up the gameplay, it is possible to access a pre-turn mode where the next moves can be planned while the opponent is issuing orders. There are both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes, and it is possible to play with or against bots.\n\nThe WiiWare version has a few less multiplayer maps.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15900,"FileName":"355cf34a-7935-40dd-8445-8c6d5eca0b95.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11125,"Name":"MindJack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It is A.D. 2041.

But instead of hiring unreliable minions he transforms innocent animals into fearsome warriors. A ninja master notices how every transformation destabilizes the balance of nature, causing storms and earthquakes, and decides to send out his best ninja disciples to restore the order. When none of them returns, he is left with his last choice: the young ninja Hiro and his blunt friend Futo. Players control the characters through different worlds using a third-person perspective with a relative amount of freedom to explore the environment. When lost, the characters can meditate to receive a hint and see an arrow that points into the general direction of the next objective.\n\nDuring the course of the game they will follow the steps of the other warriors and eventually free four of them to make them playable. The player can switch between any character at any given moment. Each ninja has different abilities. Hiro is an allrounder and the only ninja who can use Kuji spells. Unlocked by finding and praying at hidden shrines, spells include fireballs, whirlwinds and the ability to enter a spirit form where animals can be taken over to have them fight. They also make it easier to spot items and collectibles in the environment. Animals are locked up in cages but also appear when an enemy is defeated and they return to their original form. Futo wields a large hammer and is especially useful to engage larger enemies. The other characters that become available during the course of the game are Suzume, a young girl with a flute that enchants enemies when she plays music, Shun, a master with the bow, Tora who thinks he's a tiger and has big metal claws to proof it, and the acrobat Kunoichi with a long spear.\n\nCharacters have basic attacks along with a defence breaker to stun enemies and the ability to block. Acrobatic moves include wall jumping, running along walls and hanging from ledges. All characters have a sneak mode where they can hide in the grass or the environment to cause more damage when attacking or to simply avoid confrontations. Health is restored by gathering fruit and there are collectible items in the environments. When new recipes are bought, these items can be mixed into potions, bombs and power-ups. Characters level up to get better abilities and they all have a different focus attack to cause more damage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12374,"FileName":"5e92efbc-d83e-495a-952e-2a3c52cef5fd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12374,"FileName":"ff096943-4c97-41ac-aa38-90b43cdac9c3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12374,"FileName":"18cb9a40-a837-4d44-af1d-634302f5a7a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12374,"FileName":"373c11e9-5db6-40e0-995b-15cce93ef29a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12374,"FileName":"313026a9-d74d-46fe-ad0f-48440ce0a438.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14292,"Name":"Minute to Win It","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"There is pending legal action.

The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue Thunder, Captain's Cruise, it's previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one of the most influential monster trucks of all time .\n\nAt the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The amount of points given depend on the player's performance in the following events:\nFreestyle - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it is advisable to \"keep the action going\" until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a succession will result in magnifying the score.\n\n\nTrack Circuit - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside.\n\n\nEliminator - is the classic knock-out race in which each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it.\n\n\nStadium Circuit - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other.\n\n\nStadium Racing - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track.\nOnce the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam.\n\nThe game makes heavy emphasis on it's fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points and allowing player to use \"nitro boost\" for a prolonged amount of time.\n\nThe game may be played in two difficulty modes: \"Normal\" - is enough for everyone, while \"Pro\" is meant for die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Torus Games","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166288,"FileName":"f66cfecb-d6f2-482e-91de-2141f040d35e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166288,"FileName":"1c236c35-4b9d-4034-963b-e700701abb4c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166288,"FileName":"ba48d36b-5d9a-4b6c-8994-f8a517cfecbb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8307,"Name":"Monster Jam: Path of Destruction","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Monster Jam: Path of Destruction is all about authenticity, personality, and fun, with 30 officially licensed Monster Jam trucks, including fan-favorites Grave Digger, Maximum Destruction, and Grinder.

New weapons and weapon upgrades can be bought from the local mechanic with collected items found throughout each level, and with tokens dropped when zombies die. By using their favorite melee weapon, each character can make a special attack move when their power bar is at maximum level from killing enemies. There's also 16 unique guns built from 25 different weapon parts found in each level and with 3 different upgradable levels of power. Other weapons include wacky ones like lawnmowers, nailguns, cellphone tazers, bicycle grenade launchers, defribulators, and CD shooters, as well as more traditional Molotov cocktails, rocket launchers, and pipe shotguns. Later in the game, even vehicles and ships can be used such as a UFO which has a laser death beam. \n\nUsing the Unreal Engine 3 and Ageia's PhysX enables realistic physics-based destruction along with detailed lighting, environmental and character details. The plot is moved forward by comic-strip cut scenes, including showing the name and abilities of new zombie mutations as they first appear.

They also use the player's avatar to represent the character. All games can be played alone or for up to four local players, taking turns. The games can be played individually in Freeplay or as Motion Mix, where three are selected randomly. By playing well in Motion Mix points can be earned to level up. In Freeplay stars need to be earned to open up new levels. Each game comes with two Easy levels and by earning stars Medium (level 3 to 7) and eventually Hard (level 7 to 10) are unlocked. Games also often have multipliers.\nBalance Beam: balance as many blocks on a bar as possible without dropping any. The character walks on a conveyor belt while holding the bar and stars pass by that need to be collected by moving your feet. There are buckets to the sides where the blocks can be dropped, but this needs to be delayed as long as possible. At a faster speed bombs will start passing by next to the stars and these need to be avoided.\n\nCrank It Up: here a crank needs to be turned forward or backward at a steady pace to drop blocks from a tube above. When they drop they need to be hit towards a target. The game measures the amount of power and there can be up to three shapes (square/circle/rectangle) that need to be hit in the appropriate target. Over time the position of the targets also changes.\n\nDodge Ball: the player has a boxing glove on each hand and up to three robo cannons fire balls at the player. These need to be dodged or hit back at the cannons.\n\nHeavily Armed: this one is similar to Balance Beam except there is only half a beam and it is on the left arm. Players need to match the shapes according to a sequence shown on the screen and once it is achieved a hatch on the right side of the screen needs to be opened to dump the blocks inside. The patterns become more complex over time with different types of pieces.\n\nJuggle Struggle: from three to five balls need to be juggled while the character needs to move over floor panels that light up. Later levels introduce bombs that need to be dropped.\n\nOff The Grid: the player is on a grid with a moving area that turns 90 degrees. Blocks appear in patterns and the player needs to tell where the shapes line up on the 3x3 grid to avoid them by jumping or ducking.\n\nRobo Control: the player controls a robot in a small area. The left hand is used to pump, the right one to steer. Pumping determines the acceleration and the robot needs to be steered past shapes and obstacles on the playing field towards areas marked with a green rectangle.\n\nSack Hack: play hacky sack, but combined with arm movement to keep it in the air. Up to three sacks need to be juggled eventually.\n\nShape Dodge: similar to a reversed Hole in the Wall the character is on a conveyor belt and needs to dodge Tetris-like shapes while collecting stars that pass by. Later levels have walls that only break into the shapes at the last moment, requiring fast reflexes.\n\nStar Hop: again on a conveyor belt like Shape Dodge, but this time the character needs to step on stars and avoid the bombs by jumping, moving out of the way or standing on one foot.\n\nStar Stream: use both arms to collect streams of stars that often have the angle changed. In later levels the floor panel mechanic from Juggle Struggle is added.\n\nTilt Board: a game where a board needs to be tilted to guide a ball towards a hole.\nAfter each game photos are shown from the player performing during gameplay.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14283,"FileName":"0b5ae714-a246-45c9-95cd-57baa669ebf9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14283,"FileName":"3a939bb0-7637-4f9b-8137-ae645d369c91.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14293,"Name":"Motionsports Adrenaline","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"8 Insanely Dangerous Sports-Experience pulse-pounding sports like wingsuit proximity flying, kiteboarding, whitewater kayaking, mountain biking, free fall skydiving, ETRM skiing, jungle parkour and more.\nRisk It All for Greatness-Reap rewards for recklessness - the riskier your moves, the bigger the bonuses.\nConquer the Wonders of the World-From mountain top temples in the Himalayas to the tumultuous Amazon River and its world famous waterfalls, travel to the far reaches of the globe in search of the ultimate high.\nInstinctive Motion Gameplay-Use motion control to experience adrenaline-pumping extreme sports like never before.\nTake on your Friends-Compete solo or with a friend in multiple game modes such as Speed Round, Tricks and Collectibles, Challenges, and Survival mode.

An extend item can also be found if the third stage mid-boss is destroyed using the pierce shot.\nAccessing the second loop requires completing the first five stages without losing a single life. If the extend item is collected in stage 3, the player can die once and still proceed to the second loop. Stages 6–10 are identical to the first five stages, but are much more difficult.

Initially the many different races of the world lived in peace, a power granted by mythical orb which created the world. However, the orb is mysteriously shattered which leads the different races (humans, elves, orcs, goblins, and more) to distrust each other and eventually leads to the giant, unnamed battle. Throughout the game you control seven different characters, each of which provide a different perspective on the battle. Some parts of each characters story overlap allowing a different point of view while other parts are unique. Initially only one character is available, and by progressing through the game the additional characters will be unlocked; in order to see the complete story you will need to complete all of the scenarios for each character.\n\nEach scenario in the game is a large scale battle involving hundreds of opponents to defeat; each character you control has a variety of moves available and as you level up additional moves become available. The varying maneuvers available are performed by pressing different button combos on the controller. As you defeat enemies red orb crystals are earned which fill a meter; when the orb meter is finally full you are able to perform a more powerful attack capable of taking out many foes. While performing this attack you earn blue orb crystals which fill up a second meter; when that meter is full you have one of your most powerful attacks available to you. \n\nSince you will be fighting a significant number of enemies at one time you don't enter battle alone; two groups of warrior guard units fight with you. At the beginning of each mission you can choose the type of guard units to bring with you, such as archers who specialize in long range attacks or the infantry who are better at close range combat. You also have the ability to give them some simple commands such as calling the guards to your side for protection or attacking a target.\n\nAs you progress through the missions, different items can be found. These include more powerful weapons, improved armor, or magical items which increase your hit points or decrease damage received. After each mission a new mission will become available on the world map; you have the option of playing or replaying any of the missions which are unlocked on the map which allows you to level up on easier missions if you have trouble defeating one of the tougher ones.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Beat 'em Up","Developer":"Q Entertainment","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2006-08-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"451ee465-3268-493e-a06a-03d271985085.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"0c06869c-bc05-432c-8c6c-7ee786b87e11.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"83f216d6-ed16-43c6-b38f-bf93f89f39ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"a408d23d-743c-42ec-be8a-45a1140f222e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"eb1f6f9e-95c7-4710-a892-8e88d3561672.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"3910a092-248c-48c8-9f2f-c32f35c4bf78.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"c41972aa-3d85-4160-80ae-e54d49550168.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"2f9efc50-f718-450c-b8d5-000b846670f2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":7557,"FileName":"81e5b08d-271b-43e0-a22a-a5f567880b21.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":9744,"Name":"Nail'd","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In nail'd, the player takes the place of the driver participating in the off-road racing tournament.

As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.\n\nThe available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events.

With gameplay more akin to European-style \"Soccer Manager\" games than the Madden NFL franchise from which it spawned, the original NFL Head Coach generally received lukewarm reviews from critics. But after a one-year hiatus -- during which it presumably did a little TV and work spent some quality time with the family -- the franchise returns with a new focus on depth and realism. Once again the coach's livelihood depends on his approval rating, and everything gamers do, from win/loss record, to going for it on fourth down, to choosing whether to yell at the QB after a bad interception, will affect approval rating. \n\nKey personnel decisions have been given an added sense of urgency with the new Live Event feature, which puts all trade, free agency, coaching, and contract negotiations up against a running timer. As in real life, the draft is the centerpiece of the NFL offseason, and gamers can prepare by scouting players in college all-star games, at the NFL combine, and during pro-day and individual workouts. Meanwhile, players can get running commentary on the lives and college careers of more than 20,000 unique draft prospects from NFL Network personality Adam Schefter. Other additions intended to increase realism include: Non-drafted free agent rookies, 75-man preseason rosters, trades involving future draft picks, a new wear and tear injury system, and 300 new sideline animations. \n\nNFL Head Coach 09's online features allow gamers to upload created plays and download, rate, or view any play available. Two players can also go head-to-head in a quick test of coaching acumen. Offline, gamers can adjust their plays in the middle of a game and save the new formations, or create entire playbooks using the coach clipboard user interface. All created plays can then be exported and used in Madden NFL 09. ~ Christopher Brown, All Game Guide","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"EA Tiburon","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13607,"FileName":"4baa00bb-540a-4621-bb0d-17a71b778314.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13607,"FileName":"0814ad4b-ad17-428e-9a11-9750939aad97.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13607,"FileName":"aac439f5-8b79-47f3-a2c1-7187cb613d40.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16034,"Name":"NFL Tour","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"NFL Tour is an arcade football video game.

The game starts in medias res with Ryu attacking a giant creature through a quick time event. Soon after it is revealed through a flashback that he was contacted by the government because an unknown group launched a terrorist attack in London and took control of the area surrounding the prime minister's residence, taking him hostage. In a video they declare they want Hayabusa handed to them. He travels to London from Japan but has no intention of just surrendering. Later on in the game it is revealed the group behind the attack is a cult of alchemists who want to establish a new world order with Ryu as the catalyst. From London the journey eventually takes him to a city in the Rub' al Khali desert, Abysmo Island in the Indian Ocean, Hayabusa Village in Japan, the Howard Phillips Plains in Antarctica, the Pacific Ocean, and finally back in Tokyo, Japan. The story no longer involves the struggle with Fiends and Archfiends from the previous games.\n\nJust like the other titles in the series gameplay is centered around fast-paced combat with a quick succession of moves to build up combos and fight off multiple enemies at the same time. Moves are performed with a combination of weak and strong attacks. Incoming attacks can be blocked and there is a new slide manoeuvre and a visual camera trick in slow motion when he performs a body-piercing move, along with finishers. Enemies in the air can be attacked using an auto-targeting bow with unlimited ammo and there are also shurikens. The ninja can fly down and attack from the air, use a new technique to climb walls using his kunai with a quick succession of buttons, or sneak up from behind and perform a stealth kill. Many of the opponents are mechanical and equipped with guns. Early in the game he receives an evil curse that fuses his dragon sword into his arm, causing it to pulsate with veins. This makes Ryu feel the pain of each victim as he kills someone. The effect of the curse makes him more powerful or weaker at certain moments in the game. After killing a certain amount of enemies the arm lights up red and he can perform Grip of the Murder to perform a devastating attack. Compared to the earlier games enemies are no longer as deadly efficient in their attacks and Ryu can sustain more damage where an arcade-like approach is often put before strategic and slow fighting.\n\nThere is no longer a store and items are few. A few new swords are discovered gradually and arrows for the bow also become stronger. The Ninpo concept from the previous games is still present, but in only one form. Defeating enemies fills up a bar and once it is full Ninpo can be activated to transform into a dragon to kill all enemies in the environment and regain full health. In the multiplayer additional Ninpo are available. The save system with statues has been replaced by checkpoints where a falcon swoops down, also restoring health. The game structure is largely linear, but in larger environments a button can be used to sense the path to follow when stuck.\n\nAfter completing the first level Shadows of the World is unlocked, the online multiplayer mode which is a first for the series. It offers cooperative challenges and online deathmatch games for up to eight players simultaneously. Progress is persistent and the experience while fighting is used to unlock new tools and abilities permanently for the character. The PlayStation 3 version is compatible with the Move peripheral for controlling and guiding the attacks.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Fighting","Developer":"Team Ninja","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"8eab9af7-7490-4b02-a87c-d9063497f9b5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"28b3dce6-6696-435c-adcc-c9814c1e6e97.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"a2801ba8-741c-43f3-afab-5c6f08d3f5a7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"c52764b4-5aa7-4e06-ba8d-fb805196d043.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"b5f759a8-4165-49bc-9d1c-a4d70a9b0a0d.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"60781cf6-acbb-45d9-82bb-70adfea49b23.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"afd41794-81c3-42e4-8fb6-1d81b93f44e2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"fa51f653-c4ce-4f1e-b450-0e2e5f10d1f4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"44c84f49-e8d0-4e44-8015-4a659d0449f7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"975d3151-acf1-4576-9003-af1152fdb466.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3908,"FileName":"17cc072f-1e4a-4caa-8952-54dd408277c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17134,"Name":"Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is an update of Ninja Gaiden 3.

The player begins by personalizing his captain by choosing a head among the 4 or 5 in the program before setting the color of his tee shirt. Note that, unlike last year, it is not possible to give a personalized name to his protégé, which, it must be admitted, is cruelly lacking. This being so, the first confrontation soon points the tip of his nose and gives the victorious player a first teammate. It is therefore possible to participate in tournaments, starting with the departmental level. Four teams compete to define a happy elected official who can then access the regional, then national, and so on. It is also advisable to pamper her little ones. The money earned in tournaments can indeed be spent to buy caps, new T-shirts and balls of high level adapted to each type of terrain. At the same time, each shot of the unit produces points of experience which can then be reused to boost skills divided into 4 categories: pointer, power, precision and shooter. These famous points quickly become the nerve of the war, and it is therefore necessary to train between each match by performing some mini-games consisting, for example, of targeting predefined zones. Be careful not to pull the rope too much, as this increases fatigue and reduces concentration in the game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-12-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16112,"FileName":"6b9498a7-ecaa-413b-be63-ad5118d03a29.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":16112,"FileName":"17822648-975f-432a-8b6e-2fee47ff132c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13981,"Name":"Of Orcs and Men","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Of Orcs and Men is a fantasy action role-playing game developed by Cyanide and Spiders for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.[2] The Empire of Men's oppressive threat looms over the territories of the Orcs and the Goblins.

Leading in from earlier Operation Flashpoint briefings, threats from the People's Liberation Army play a significant role as the game's narrative develops, but much of the game takes place to the north and west, along the banks of the Vakhsh, known as the \"Red River\" to the people who live there.

Besides that, the gameplay also features a few elements taken from the Persona role-playing games, such all-out attacks that knock enemies back while you charge at them, or one-more cancels, which interrupt your combo while knocking your opponent up in a way that allows you start a second one.\n\nThe game features a variety of modes, such as a lengthy tutorial that explains all the options, a \"challenge\" mode where you are asked to perform advanced combos and a \"score attack\" mode where fighting comes second to getting the most points, as well as standard features like Versus and Practice modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xdQM2vGO_k","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting; Visual Novel","Developer":"Arc System Works Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Index Digital Media, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2012-08-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"52100462-93bc-464c-b53c-39bf1703b2bb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"1c82b7a5-f853-47b2-a0c2-eeaa4f18de43.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"f99a534d-327a-46a2-a595-9bfca7ca14d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"721af6af-ac12-40be-9bbc-c8f8800174a6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"ce544b7f-dba4-4bb7-88ed-dd587c61738e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"ff8c50cf-2bdc-47bb-a44a-480996ad6bd4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"ce7dd014-33ec-4368-8cb8-d2f17d0ab37b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"dbc05aac-7e86-44c3-929c-03edcca3a386.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"ab3ed396-e020-4c25-a073-beea6204a551.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"10b48551-d16a-4926-afbd-814ae4f52d0b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12616,"FileName":"927cee0c-0eed-498d-ba27-5ade793fcc4b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12616,"AlternateName":"Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":16208,"Name":"PES 2008: Pro Evolution Soccer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 (officially abbreviated as PES 2008 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2008 in Korea and Japan, sometimes called World Soccer: Winning Eleven 11 in PS2) is an association football video game in the Pro Evolution Soccer series by Konami.

The game features many new moves and the players move more slowly and realistic. Even a mediocre player can now have a lucky strike and hit the net from 40 meters away. Most graphical improvements go into the detail of players' faces and shadows. Although there are still five levels of gameplay, this time the computer AI acts differently from before and opens up new ways to play the game.\n\nThere are game modes present from earlier titles in the franchise, such as Exhibition or Master League, but also some new ones like UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Become a Legend mode introduced in PES 2009 is also available. Aside from graphics, details were put into tactics and strategy where players can be positioned with more accuracy, according to his talent. An entirely new feature is the card system, tied to certain players' unique abilities. This gives that player an advantage over its opponent. In previous titles certain top players could perform stunning moves without the player's control. With the card system in PES 2010 directly control over this becomes available.\n\nThe Master League mode is more detailed and comes with sponsors, youth teams and real currencies (including Euro, British Pound, US Dollar, or Japanese Yen). Money can also be used to pay a scout who deals with negotiations, physical aspects, the trainer and other staff members. The Premier League, Liga Espanola, Italian League, Eredivisie and others are still included, as well as World Cup, Konami Cup and others, with national teams and league teams largely up-to-date.\n\nUnlike earlier instalments, the player's individual graphical representation is gone. It is still possible to see them as a part of an entire team, but no longer for individual players. This means it takes time to get acquainted with them by going through numerical statistics or checking the compatibility of the players' maximum performance with the position they are at.\n\nCo-op is on par with the franchise, with assisted player switching and semi-assisted and manual switching. Manual meaning is complete and the player will not be switched until it is determined by the player, while semi-automatic will switch to the player a pass is given to.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-QRfrE4pIA","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16221,"FileName":"ce3a6dc7-c226-470b-ba9e-d78a458e1823.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16221,"FileName":"f85664bb-ef4f-4c38-b9ac-18015e85b79c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16221,"FileName":"008db057-4335-4a5c-bae6-dbbe3dcb1cea.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16221,"FileName":"a0948bf5-92f8-4302-847d-6930eec8754b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":16221,"AlternateName":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2010","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":16225,"Name":"PES 2011: Pro Evolution Soccer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 comes with new teams for 2010/2011 and plenty new features.

You can now turn on stamina gauge above controlling player and see ball kicking gauge every time you hit a ball, be that shooting on a goal or a simple pass to another friendly player. There is more detailed game plan than before with easy adjustment of strategies, especially when it comes to positions of an individual player. According to Konami, aside the typical passing, feints, dribbling or defence actions, this game features over 1000 new motions, but what can be done with the ball depends, as usual, on the player you are controlling.\n\nThere are even more licensed cups and leagues this time, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League as well as some new ones like Copa Libertadores and UEFA Super Cup. Even a Club World Cup mode is available as a part of other modes, but without a licensed name or logo.

Player AI has been massively upgraded, with players running intelligently into space when not in possession of the ball and pointing where they want the pass placed to continue the attack. Similarly, the physical side of play has been refined, with players working to turn a defender as they receive the ball, while defenders must learn to stand off slightly to prevent such moves.\nSeries creator Shingo `Seabass` Takatsuka has also worked to refine the shooting system of the new game, and players will be able to attempt more snap shots than in previous versions, while volleys and half-volleys have been redesigned. Other new moves include the ability to retain control of the ball when sliding in to tackle, while all-new feints and backwards dribbling are now available thanks to the improved dribbling controls, while headers have been changed to allow players more movement in the way their strikers jump and head the ball.\n\nPro Evolution Soccer 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Details on official club teams and more national squads will follow.\n\nOther new additions include more balanced referees, and a selection of exciting new gameplay modes. An International Challenge involves leading your home country to victory through a series of entry and tournament rounds, while a Random mode lets the player play quick games within randomly-generated match day settings. The much-loved Master League also returns, allowing players to experience the many highs and lows of steering a team through years of competitive games.

It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\n\nThe game retains Portal‍ '​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\n\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZD17pQSqUU","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Puzzle; Shooter","Developer":"Valve Corporation","Publisher":"Valve Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2011-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"652fb068-c655-419a-ad04-052e9a9fa03d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"65324fcd-5209-49e0-8564-257efa417cfd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"0556e635-aa9b-4243-99c9-5108c8125f2e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"7969e3ba-d874-475c-9864-b3de9452c3ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"64489078-4c6c-4f9c-b26f-12031d30c83b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"ab7faaf1-4a96-4eb2-86ae-02942ea68ac0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6270,"FileName":"66255de4-ecd4-444b-b809-e8d5b0891c5a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":106328,"Name":"Portal: Still Alive","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Portal: Still Alive is an Xbox 360 port of the hugely successful PC puzzle game.

They are transported into The Sphere, an enormous, organic alien ship. Tommy is set free by one of the denizens and his task is to save his girlfriend Jen and grandfather Enisi, and find out what the meaning of The Sphere is.\n\nThis 3D-shooter, based on a modified version of the Doom 3 engine, takes place entirely inside the gigantic ship. As a combination of organic and cybernetic structures, gravity is defied: with the proper grids activated, you can walk on walls and ceilings. There are also multiple dimensions inside the ship you can cross using portals. During his quest, Tommy struggles with his Native American lineage. The ghost-like hawk Talon is always on your side and you sometimes cross over to another land to get help from your grandfather. Tommy can also shift to Spirit Walk, an alternate dimension in the game to get past obstacles and solve puzzles. When you die, you are also transported to another realm where you have to shoot lost souls with your spirit bow before being sent back. Your new health and spirit status will be based on your performance there.\n\nThe weapons Tommy uses are usually organic, with secondary fire functions. The arsenal includes a wrench, a rifle, crawlers, an acid sprayer, an auto cannon, a leech gun (chargeable with fire, ice, red orbs or lightning), a rocket launcher and the spirit bow. Certain parts of the game require you to explore large areas in a flying pod. You can use it to engage enemies or use the tractor beam to move objects.

His mission is to get into Fox River prison and report to the company about Michael's attempts to escape with his brother.

Most of the game is composed of objectives given to Paxton by other inmates. These objectives, for the most part, involve sneaking past security guards, janitors, or hostile inmates, staying unnoticed at all times. If the protagonist is spotted, the player returns to the previous check-point and has to play the part of the sequence again. If the hostile character is an inmate, it is possible to fight him.\n\nThere are also other activities the protagonist can engage in when not being on a mission, such as lifting weights, getting tattoos, and fighting other inmates for money and other prizes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Stealth","Developer":"ZootFly, LLC.","Publisher":"Deep Silver, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2010-03-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16206,"FileName":"5881b554-c072-4832-a7d7-3f36b8e303f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":16206,"FileName":"e8969bbe-50cd-44a5-8d94-2b79532374ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":16206,"FileName":"9bbf28da-63d5-4eca-9f6f-226ae156ba6d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7564,"Name":"Project Gotham Racing 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Project Gotham Racing 3 (PGR3 for short) is an arcade-style racing game that was released with the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005 for the US market and December 2, 2005 in Europe, and was released on January 12, 2006 in Japan.

The game's story takes place in the year 2632, five hundred years after humanity left the solar system. Under Earth's rule, 11 different star systems have now been terraformed and colonized. However, there are a number of groups who object to Earth's rule and desire independence; four of them have joined forces and formed a rebel group called the ADAN Freedom Alliance. The main characters in the story are Katana Faraway, Ellen Bernstein, and Margras Mason; all are young pilots having just joined the Earth's military, the Terra Central Armed Forces (TCAF). Following a suspicious accident, Margras joins the opposing ADAN forces to fight against his former friends and home planet. You control Katana in the game, and as missions are completed the story progresses.\n\nWhile previous Silpheed games utilized a top down view of the action, Project Sylpheed features a fully 3-D view from either just behind your ship, or a first person view from within it. During the game you'll need to complete a series of missions; these are varied and include having to destroy all opponents in an area or defend an allied ship from attack. Initially there are fewer enemies and you don't have powerful weaponry, but as the game progresses the enemy increases in count and abilities and you can upgrade your ship with more powerful weapons. During a mission several sub-objectives may also become available which can be completed (some of the sub-objectives also unlock Xbox 360 Achievements when completed).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/GrhRCqeFayA?t=520","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Game Arts","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2007-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"61bcba1d-6bf9-4899-be3e-ff84f9722772.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"2f909d34-ca39-45a9-85d0-b59604960b95.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"fd20a58e-40ec-47b2-8b72-5eaf20bae259.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"0f906118-fb1a-4668-b151-29b6b7cd19c4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"65156950-cfa8-4965-b9bf-4a48e37c28ab.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"ba24dc7b-e38b-4819-b2a8-a67983e92a0f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"71ae510b-8f76-432c-bf43-527a2195aa29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7565,"FileName":"7b32204e-7f30-4beb-acef-0330251f0864.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7565,"AlternateName":"Project Sylpheed: Arc of Deception ","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":142429,"Name":"Protect Me Knight","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Protect Me Knight is a retro style action tower defense game developed by Ancient for the Xbox 360’s Xbox Live Indie Games service. \n\nPlayers assume the roles of four character classes (Fighter, Ninja, Amazon, or Mage) tasked with protecting the Princess from legions of monsters.

The campaign tells the stories of the American officer Joe Sheridan and the German Erich von Richter, which have to command troops in different war zones all over Europe and North America. In accordance with the game's theme the overarching plot is about catching a spy.\n\nIn contrast to most other WWII games, the battles in RUSE: The Art of Deception take place on big maps - and this is to be taken literally. There is no 3D environment, and the only models are the war units on a land map. At least if the player currently is on one of the nearer zoom levels. If the game is zoomed out the player has a greater overview, and the units are shown in an abstract form which can be described as stacked, differently colored poker chips. Then only a whole troop can be given orders; to move single units the player has to use the stepless zoom to have a closer look. The strategy itself consists of the usual system of different unit types which have advantages and disadvantages against other types. Basic base building elements exist, but play no big role: there are only production facilities and defense towers to build. Resource depots can be conquered.\n\nThe combatants can utilize various deceptions. Those are similar to special attacks in other games and apply to a certain part of the map. Examples are hiding all friendly units, showing the movement path of enemy units with big red arrows, fake units to distract the enemy or disguising heavy units as light units (and the other way around).\n\nAdditionally to the campaign there are two co-op maps and four separate maps against powerful AI generals.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2010-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16262,"FileName":"d73d81cb-18f7-4700-8095-ba3c6e6835c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":16262,"AlternateName":"R.U.S.E.: The Art of Deception","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163374,"Name":"Rabbids Invasion","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163374,"FileName":"ddf663d8-5df0-4122-ac2c-e09d7d1cef2f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163374,"FileName":"d1e4996f-cd67-4aa3-bf4a-24bb5c3de1c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13259,"Name":"Race Pro","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Race Pro is a sim racing video game developed by SimBin (developers of the GTR PC racing series) and published by Atari exclusively for Xbox 360.[2] The game is described as having \"ultra realistic car models\" with cars ranging in power from 200 hp (150 kW) to 1,000 hp (750 kW).

It consists of a series of sequences from the three movies in chronological order, preceded by a flashback tutorial level set in Vietnam. The gameplay is based around the rail shooter concept and does not offer freedom of movement. Instead the camera guides the player through the levels while the player moves the cross-hair in a first-person view to take out enemies. These are often combined with non-lethal takedowns using quick time events. In those sections the player is encouraged to shoot hands and legs to disarm opponents instead of killing them directly. Sometimes the two gameplay concepts are combined in stealth sections.\n\nLots of enemies need to be killed and the player is rewarded with a multiplier for linking kills. Sometimes an enemy has an exclamation mark over the head and needs to be killed quickly, or his shot is lethal. Other gameplay elements include a cover system through arrows on the screen, active reload for double ammunition, and a kill cam for precise shots. While fighting Rambo builds up a wrath meter. Once activated, time slows down, there is unlimited ammo, and enemies glow orange and provide health when killed. By killing people and completing sections experience is earned to assign skill points and unlock perks. Up to three can be assigned simultaneously. Next to the main mission goals there are optional challenges provided by Colonel Trautman. Completing these opens up the ability to determine which weapons to take into a level. Rambo fights with a knife, guns and grenades.

This game, however, is played in one of the most unconventional manners likely ever seen in the pantheon of fishing games. Motion controls with the Kinect peripheral are the singular input methods for the game.\n\nThere are two primary modes in the game, Arcade Fishing and Boat Race Mode. Arcade fishing is generally as it sounds, simply fishing with a focus on catching the largest fish, and certain target fish in the fastest times and hardest of three difficulties (which can be selected as a fish is first caught). Players cast the line, attract a fish and reel the fish in. This, however, is where Rapala for Kinect takes a drastic departure from a typical arcade fishing game. Player physically swing their right arm overhand to cast a line, and scan the level moving left to right with the left arm. Various actions may then be done to attract a fish, such as twisting the torso to either side, moving hands quickly in circular patterns, moving hands up and down, and the like. \n\nWhen a fish is hooked is when things get interesting. There are three different difficulty settings to choose once a fish has been hooked, and they're selected by the player holding their arms out in the right direction and angle as indicated by onscreen prompts. The easiest mode simply has players \"punching\" or slapping the fish to reel it in. The medium challenge requires players to hold their arms out at the proper angles to clear onscreen prompts. The hardest difficulty requires players to get their whole body in on it: Players must match five different poses in quick succession to reel in a catch. Poses run the gamut of a sumo position, a military salute, a surfer-themed move called \"super cool,\" a \"number 1\" pose, and other abstract positions. These must be performed quickly in order to be recognized and to prevent the fish from fighting back and forcing the player to start the process over. The final part of this endeavor may require the player to physically \"reel in\" the fish by moving their arms to and from their chest in a circular motion. Different kinds of lures are factored into the fishing, and just like real fishing, the lures have their own personalities, and talk in their own voices!\n\nBoat races are performed by players holding both arms straight ahead as if they're holding an actual steering wheel. Steering the boat is performed simply by turning the hands to turn the boat. Players can also lean left or right to further affect the turning. Special items and power-ups are scattered about the races which affect both the boat races and the regular arcade fishing. Boat races may also be performed separately from the main arcade mode.\n\nThe game also features an Aquarium where the types of fish caught in the main game up to that point can be viewed, and a Fish Face Creator mode where players may put their own faces on the fish. Fish with player faces will appear occasionally during gameplay for special point bonuses. Player fish also appear in the Aquarium. There is also a multiplayer mode with two players simultaneously, or up to four in a tournament setting. Several unlockable items are also available, the foremost being new fishing areas unlocked through regular gameplay, and new fishing lures.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8883,"FileName":"0b088326-f450-46d0-94bc-c2bcac6c7671.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8883,"FileName":"ffedda27-01ae-4eaf-97c6-fa0b7f0d89eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8883,"FileName":"3699c159-0baf-4558-8d6a-ace35f666513.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8883,"FileName":"d01e51b8-9bf2-42a4-a98d-ca6ac1be2df9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8883,"AlternateName":"Rapala for Kinect","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":173671,"Name":"Rapala Fishing Frenzy 2009","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Put your angling skills to the test in the best bass locations in North America\nFeatures 9 species of monster bass and 14 other trophy fish, such as trout, salmon, northern pike, catfish and walleye\nFish in 6 great lakes: Lake Wylie, Clear Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, Lake Amistad, Logan Martin Lake, and Lake Okeechobee\nCompete in 20 events, as well as Open Fishing and Quick Challenge modes","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Fun Labs","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173671,"FileName":"4edfcd01-ff4c-4afb-a4a1-3382e6241620.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":173671,"FileName":"b1f59ce0-ad26-4f3f-96ec-8828c4bf1f22.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8884,"Name":"Rapala Pro Bass Fishing","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rapala Pro Bass Fishing has you testing your fishing skills in a tournament setting against real-life professionals.

This is really just another take on the classic top-down shooter that started to show up in arcades way back in the early '80s. The only real difference between it and predecessors like 1943 and Xevious is the use of a lock-on feature. That feature lets you target a bunch of enemy ships with a cursor and blast them with a one-button laser barrage. You can fire away with a standard cannon, too, but it's secondary to the lasers because you earn multipliers when you lock onto and incinerate numerous baddies simultaneously. Using lasers is also necessary due to sheer self-preservation. Enemies cover the entire screen with blasts of fiery instant death, so you're best off targeting multiple crafts with the laser and taking them all out with the single push of a button.

It is set in a fantasy world where dwarves, elves and humans are at war - and now another, dark power sends demons into this world. A powerful ghost makes the player character his avatar in order to defeat this power. Unfortunately no one knows this and so the player has to kill everyone met except the occasional quest giver.\n\nThis is a typical hack & slash game. The player chooses one of three classes (warrior, rogue or wizard) and mows down thousands of enemies in linear levels. This rewards experience points and after earning enough, the character levels up; although only once per stage. This rewards a point which is in turn invested into upgrading skills. Those skills are class specific with the exception of the incarnation ability which allows to take control over an enemy for a short time. Attributes only improve when finding and equipping better weapons and armor.\n\nThe control system changes depending on the used input device: direct control with a gamepad and indirect control (Diablo II-style clicking) with mouse and keyboard. A second player can join in at any time and automatically starts with the appropriate level - progress is only saved for the first player. When one character dies, it respawns after a few seconds with full health if the other player survives that long.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16313,"FileName":"79a23ebb-b005-4ddb-a3b2-d6aa7e5e8ece.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16313,"FileName":"6cb22171-16b9-4e54-ac80-6d66c83e5423.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":16313,"AlternateName":"R.A.W: Realms of Ancient WarDiscuss","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":12537,"Name":"Record of Agarest War","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Choose the path of Darkness or Light through a truly epic story, spanning multiple generations.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Idea Factory","Publisher":"Aksys Games","ReleaseDate":"2010-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12537,"FileName":"7844f491-a896-4724-b7ab-f4ea77914dc9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12537,"FileName":"31276838-da36-452e-8295-94c2161ac559.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12537,"FileName":"8ade061d-8ab9-4273-ac84-141c5e5c27e9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12618,"Name":"Record of Agarest War Zero","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long before Summerill and the gods of darkness were defeated in Record of Agarest War, another battle was fought across generations to save the world from evil.

A group of rebels calling themselves the Red Faction had overthrown the ruthless Ultor Corporation after years of oppression. The EDF responded by launching a fleet of warships to Mars to aid the miners, bring Ultor to justice and restore order to the Martian colonies. In order to ensure safety and security for the newly liberated colonists, the EDF set up command posts and bases across the planet. Initially, under the EDF's rule, the people of Mars prospered: colonists established homesteads, built towns and independent mining operations and began to stake and work their mining claims. But the more things change on Mars, the more they stay the same.\n\nThe troubles began with colonists being driven from their homes and mining claims by greedy, Earth-based corporations. Then came a 50 year turn of events that saw the EDF adopting the heavy-handed tactics that it once stood against. Yet in doing so it also instilled a deep-seated resentment among the miners and settlers of the Martian colonies. One of these new Martians is miner Alec Mason, whose dream of a new life carved out of the course Martian soil was crushed in the face of EDF-ordered curfews, detention centers, beatings, mass arrests and personal tragedy. But as powerful as the EDF is, there is resistance. Mason and a small group of revolutionaries have banded together, taken up the Red Faction name and pledged to again bring about a free Mars. And though their enemy has changed, their battle cry remains unchanged: \"Better Red than Dead.\"\n\nKey Game Features:\n\nJoin the Revolution - When the citizens of Mars can no longer bear the injustice of an oppressive regime, the fate of the planet lies in the hands of Alex Mason and the Red Faction.\nOpen World Guerilla Warfare - You decide who, when, where and how to battle. Utilize guerilla tactics, improvised weaponry, and modified vehicles to lead insurgent attacks on EDF targets. Launch attacks based on your own gameplay style, take on missions in any order you choose, or engage in destructive activities to weaken the EDF’s grip on Mars.\nGeo-Mod Technology 2.0 - Use destruction to your tactical advantage, setting ambushes or chain reaction explosions to attack enemy strongholds and permanently modify the game environment. Leverage fully-dynamic physics-based destruction to improvise on the fly: blow holes in a wall or floor to set an ambush or escape, take out a staircase to stop your pursuers, or drive vehicles through blown out walls.\nEvolving & Emergent Gameplay - Carve your path through an ever changing landscape as you improvise your combat tactics – mixing gameplay styles, vehicles, weapons and explosives to defeat the EDF.\nEpic Sci-fi Setting - Explore the huge, unforgiving Martian landscape, from the desolate mining outpost of Parker to the gleaming EDF capital city of Eos; then tear through the fully destructible open-world environments swarming with EDF forces, Red Faction resistance fighters, and the downtrodden settlers caught in the crossfire.\nMultiplayer Combat - There is no place to hide when you put your guerilla warfare skills to the test in a variety of highly destructive 2-16 person online multiplayer combat modes.\nXbox LIVE Support - Build your Xbox 360 gamer score, achievements collection and leaderboard placement through full Xbox LIVE support.\nGuerilla Warfare\nYou don't stand a chance against the EDF using standard military tactics. The only recourse when the few stand against the many is the use of hit and run tactics. Learn the routes of the patrols and quickest ways in and out of EDF strongholds. By studying these things you can instinctively know when to attack, and when to wait for a better opportunity.\nAmbushes are also useful in thinning EDF ranks. Remote charges and proximity mines are your best friend when preparing an ambush. A few well-placed charges on the structural supports of a bridge can do wonders for stopping a convoy dead in its tracks. Above all else, remember this: guerilla tactics are not about fighting fair, they are about winning.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-06-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"03769ecb-cc86-4574-85f9-4ec3c3d6d235.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"4b2bbc2e-9ad2-4cd8-a063-150cffa8c275.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"34b9994b-2085-430e-9852-e03252fa221d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"643cce42-a8fc-4ccf-875c-dcc4e9a05767.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"20309213-ed2b-491f-9c4d-758e986ddb8e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"eac76eb7-8afb-4120-884a-971449a7b602.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11904,"FileName":"001cff86-a594-46f9-a958-9a4b00044240.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16323,"Name":"Red Johnson's Chronicles - One Against All","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mechs or tanks?

The sixth main entry in the Resident Evil horror series, the game was originally released for the GameCube in North America and Japan in January 2005, and in Europe and Australia in March 2005.\n\nThe story of Resident Evil 4 follows the U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the U.S. President's daughter who has been kidnapped by a sinister cult. Traveling to a remote rural area of Europe, Leon fights hordes of violent villagers and mutated monsters, and reunites with the mysterious spy Ada Wong. The game pioneered and popularized the \"over the shoulder\" third-person view perspective in video games.\n\nFirst hinted at in early December 1999, Resident Evil 4 underwent a long development time during which four proposed versions of the game were discarded. Initially developed for the Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him to create a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, it was decided to start development over again. The game was intended to be a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and in heavily condensed versions for the iOS phones and Zeebo. In April 2013, Resident Evil 4 was launched on Android but only for Samsung smartphones via Galaxy Apps and earlier in 2013 it was available for the Japanese Google Play.[1]\n\nResident Evil 4 garnered universal critical acclaim. It received many Game of the Year awards for 2005, and was seen as a successful cross-platform hit that highly influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person shooter genres. It has since been listed among the best video games of all time.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure; Horror; Shooter","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2011-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16327,"FileName":"98156573-0a92-4855-99b2-090c576cf260.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16327,"FileName":"04b1fb1a-71c3-417a-b551-13805a856e33.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16327,"FileName":"19d6d7cb-b897-4abb-815f-9077a112e567.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11907,"Name":"Resident Evil 5","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Produced by series veteran Jun Takeuchi, this next-generation follow-up to the terrifying series introduces the theme of escape as its core survival instinct.

Not only does this setting provide a rich backdrop to the action but it fosters a unique and thrilling triple-threat battle scenario for the game modes. Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players compete against their team's opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element that could only exist in the twisted Resident Evil universe. The result is a brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With a cover-up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUe2At7zaLQ","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Slant Six Games","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"5f0a993b-f64a-488d-a5ec-428688ad8da2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"43a63b4c-cc74-476d-bb13-e0ad5d3f7716.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"b9681ec2-b171-42cf-bc42-b32ca67c104d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"5cf7f3e1-6e48-4869-b880-f5cfbf24b4ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"6041172d-c00a-43c1-834f-e24d2fbfa11a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"235b9081-fca8-4243-bed2-b9567b17dddc.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"1f9f1730-a4cc-4832-b0c5-d776bf0b089b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8887,"FileName":"a94eb8c8-91d4-42db-bd4f-ea2383bd4c7b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15187,"Name":"Resident Evil: Revelations","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Taking place in 2005, between the events of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, the action centers on BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) member Jill Valentine and introduces her new partner, Parker Luciani.

When his brother is killed in a gang-related murder by a rival biker gang, he goes on a quest for vengeance.\n\nThe game combines driving sections on a bike while fighting off bikers and dodging obstacles similar to the Road Rash games, on-foot sections with exploration and combat based on blocking, melee and ranged weapons, and rail shooter driving sections where someone else takes the wheel and Jake gets to aim and shoot as a sidecar gunner. All types of gameplay incorporate many quick time events, both in combat and while driving. Other game elements include chases (with jumps, power slides and obstacles that need to be dodged) and pursuits, hunting, deliveries and saving girls. The story is largely furthered through cut-scenes and new locations are often reached after long driving sections. Most missions have a time limit. Jake's bike can be customized through decals, paint jobs and body parts.

It takes place one year after the events of the previous game and has gameplay mechanics similar to that title. Her experiences with the supernatural in that game have been covered up by a violent sect known as Trinity. She is in the same predicament as her father before her, whose work was dismissed by the scientific community through pressure of Trinity. She travels to the Siberian tundra in search of the lost city Kitezh, to find tangible evidence of the immortal soul through a relic known as the Divine Source. The harsh and cold conditions turn most of the expedition's crew away and only Lara and her companion Jonah push through. Jonah is by her side and part of the story for several sections, but most of the game is played once again with Lara alone. A small part early in the game is played as a flashback in Syria where Lara is looking for a prophet's tomb while being hunted by Trinity, leading up to the events in Siberia.\n\nWhile many game mechanics are similar, the largest difference is the change of scenery. It introduces new types of animals and now ice plays an important role in many sections. Just like the previous game the game world consists of many smaller open world areas linked together. Lara gets to explore these freely with multiple approaches. Many surfaces can be scaled using ice axes and ziplines can cover a large distance. Other means include a rope and grapple. There are also some linear sections, but almost no quick time events unlike the previous game. As before there is often a choice between direct combat and a stealth approach, but with more emphasis on combat as it is unavoidable or very time consuming to attempt otherwise in some occasions. Melee combat is available along with the use of a knife. Lara can tackle enemies and drop down on them from trees. Unlike the previous game health does not auto regenerate, but now always requires the use of bandages that need to be crafted. For stealth, enemies can be knocked out with non-lethal takedowns, through tackling or using knock out gas. It is also possible to use foliage to hide from both animals and humans. Swimming returns to the series after being absent since Tomb Raider: Underworld. In some sections Lara can hide by swimming below the ice and enemies can be hidden underwater with stealth takedowns.\n\nAs in the previous game there are many checkpoint locations known as base camps. There Lara can convert experience into skill points to invest into a skill tree, items in an inventory are accessed and crafted, weapons can be upgraded by salvaging items and fast travel to other base camps is possible. Next to pistols, shotguns, machine guns and hunting rifles, the bow and arrow is once again an important weapon. It is used to take out enemies stealthily, but rope arrows, fire arrows and explosive arrows are also used in many situations to solve environment based puzzles. Each area has multiple objectives and challenges to complete, along with discovering and collecting relics, documents, murals and coin caches. Some of these are now provided as side quests through NPCs. Taking a cue from metroidvania games, players are encouraged to revisit areas several times with new skills and weapons to reach or open up areas that were previously inaccessible. Many items are still crafted by collecting resources stored in an inventory, for instance to create a molotov cocktail. Environments have a day-and-night cycle that influences enemy and animal behaviour. For instance, some animals Lara has to hunt down are only active at night.\n\nThe skill tree is once again split up into the categories Survivor, Hunter and Brawler, with different tiers for each and seventeen skills in total. They provide new abilities for Lara as well as weapon enhancements and other skills. For instance she can now mark enemies and then quickly take them out in succession. Many new and powerful weapons are found by completely exploring an area with the full arsenal of skills to collect all the needed parts. As before the open world environments focus on exploration and combat, while most of the puzzle-solving is done in tombs. These separate locations often require logic and the use of different weapons, levers, objects and skills to complete the tomb and grab the rewards. These locations are optional and there are more of them that in the previous game.\n\nAn entirely new part of the game, accessed from the main menu, is Expeditions. These allow players to replay and modify levels to make them easier or more challenging, a concept previously used in a similar way in Hitman: Absolution, through various modifiers. Editing actions require Expedition Cards as a currency, bought with coins from the main game or with microtransactions based on real money. The game has four difficulty levels that influence enemy health and damage, and the use of aiming assistance.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Crystal Dynamics, Inc.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2015-11-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164601,"FileName":"2c05c964-77cc-4b01-a9c6-bcca9264935d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164601,"FileName":"5c8e3908-afe2-49a9-bdc6-46c5934d0fd5.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164601,"FileName":"34e07fc7-f12d-4e30-b52b-613b52653fa3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11768,"Name":"Risen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game features a combat system with parries, blocks, and sidesteps.

The game has received widespread critical acclaim,[8] with sales of four million units and global revenues of $600 million.[9] Players have made over 100 million downloadable song purchases since Rock Band '​s release.[10] The game's success prompted the release of six sequels: Rock Band 2, The Beatles: Rock Band, Lego Rock Band, Green Day: Rock Band, Rock Band 3 and Rock Band 4.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiXMHLTZxkY","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Music","Developer":"Harmonix","Publisher":"MTV Games","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"cc4561aa-0854-445a-88df-3cdb8a4be22a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"5164e0d9-7b23-4e93-a63e-6b803789d01b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"47586347-0887-438d-a6ae-5d73e8985b43.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"07b626ec-c7f8-4d26-a31f-533302f30845.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"826ae1e1-7702-4f62-b44f-924b183532d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"c4dc62cf-9502-45c7-bdeb-652af7340c4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"9753bed1-2900-4f30-8890-adec9981ba9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"23f14e91-7e5f-484c-b5f6-096e10c63e78.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"230a4322-593e-4173-8271-a04c0a79a657.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"2f6a32e1-3084-4128-96d0-41c9ac6d247c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"7b9ccfc0-72b4-497d-a3dd-89ef7a507025.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"ec1739d0-b40b-47a9-9cf0-f6e5d8662f10.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"4c0a9344-1333-4d85-9b91-fe826097bc02.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"4052f92a-1bde-414b-af9e-5c11928a180f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"d39ef17d-2499-4853-87fc-d107d0f43ccf.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"399989cd-1c5b-477b-b5fe-a97c43cf6e1a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"69eff85f-7a7c-401e-b93d-28f90c4e714e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"103e470a-2dc4-4b04-a999-1597b069c57a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7571,"FileName":"116a0043-430d-41ff-a89e-3538f658122f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2723,"Name":"Rock Band 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay.

As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard. By working together, players can maximise their scores. Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes. When they have enough of these, they can activate \"Overdrive\" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).\n\nVocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main Rock Band series for the first time. Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals. By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up. The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, \"Pro Mode\". Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.\n\nThe Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game. Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like \"goals\". Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments. All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the \"Road Challenge\" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets. Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into \"Spades\" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items. Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cs4hxYar4","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Music","Developer":"Harmonix","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"065a3ec1-71c0-47c9-9d4b-4ee687cb4d1d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"ff6da274-1bb9-4016-adb6-01b9ccea8cb5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"fd71c029-d2ca-455a-88b1-f72d3e48f356.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"c9039d87-b8d6-4f55-83ff-c58ef221899f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"9360ad3a-5a6e-4966-aa94-c757b626e9e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"94ada18e-8ad1-418b-8c5b-3b0441e964d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"ed0d18a5-a197-4686-bd53-08d09807df70.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"2c3f648d-b3e1-4009-89e9-97d7dd5a6b55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"e3611307-169c-4b17-be73-3524dc5f31ca.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"5bc2f5e3-956e-46f6-a629-562d63b04761.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10938,"FileName":"5383a9da-514f-40f2-88cf-6e6f96ffab31.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Australia"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157992,"Name":"Rock Band Blitz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rock Band Blitz brings the excitement of a full band into your hands, transforming classic Rock Band gameplay into an addictive single player controller-based experience – no instruments needed!

Players perform single-note accompaniments, which become more complex, as they learn the finger positions of additional notes and attempt to master new songs. An automatic difficulty-scaling feature queues up more or fewer notes, according to the player's success throughout a performance. Various mini-games are designed to help players hone different skills. The software also features a tuner and several built-in pedal effects.

It was later released for the Wii on October 17, 2007 in North America, and on October 19, 2007 in Europe. The game is a realistic simulation of the sport table tennis, with the main objective to make the opponent fail to hit the ball.\n\nThe game features various methods of serving and returning the ball, designed for players to beat their opponent. Players can compete against the game's artificial intelligence, while the game's multiplayer mode lets two players compete in matches, either through local multiplayer or online. Initially developed specifically for the Xbox 360 console, the development team took advantage of the hardware's graphical power, allowing the game to play at a faster pace than with previous hardware. The game was the first to be developed using Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, later used in games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption.\n\nIts announcement in March 2006 led to confusion and surprise, due to its significantly different style from Rockstar's previous projects.

As a run-and-gun platformer it stays true to the spirit of the original game, but with a 2.5D perspective; the game visuals are in 3D but the player is able to move only over the horizontal and vertical plane, with occasional close-ups for certain kills. The player controls Sid Morrow who secretly infiltrates Russian territory fifteen years after the Cold War. His mission is to retrieve Rory Gibson, a member of team Harvest who was originally sent in during the war to investigate a material called Ulyssium that would be used to power nuclear missiles. As the war eventually ended without a confrontation, the team was extracted but Gibson was left behind. Not only is Morrow on a rescue mission fifteen years later, also needs to verify intelligence that the Russians may have reinstated the nuclear program and if that turns out to be true, he needs to sabotage it.\n\nJust like the original game there is a focus on melee combat. Morrow moves at a high speed and uses his trusty knife to take out enemies, based on the Russian martial arts technique Systema. He can perform a slide attack, use brutal finishers, push buttons, climb platforms to attack enemies there, slide down ladders, use elevators, and jump. Many enemies can still be taken out with a single hit, but the one hit death for the player has been replaced with a health bar and health pick-ups. Next to the knife Morrow can also temporarily use ranged weapons such as rocket launchers, grenades and rifles. The top right corner holds a mini-map where an abstract lay-out of the environment is shown with enemies. The story is often furthered through short scenes. Certain parts have different level paths and stealth can be applied to sneak past enemies or to hide in a dark passage. Certain kills, especially when using stealth, are rewarded with more points. Once discovered however, an alarm may be sounded and Morrow needs to rush the rest of the level. While progressing different combos can be unlocked. The game is saved automatically at certain checkpoints. The game takes place in three environments: a prison, a laboratory and a nuclear base, and there is always a boss at the end to defeat.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-03-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16392,"FileName":"333b003c-3200-428a-a0b3-b55cf055cd5b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7473,"Name":"Sacred 2: Fallen Angel","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Contorted and twisted, honorable and valiant, heroism has many faces.

There they'll meet old acquaintances (e.g. Dane Vogel and Dex) and historical figures (e.g. Shakespeare and Blackbeard).\n\nSaints Row: Gat out of Hell is an add-on sized successor to Saints Row IV. The main difference to the main game is the lack of story missions - the plot progresses by doing enough side missions. When enough chaos is created, a cutscene starts and a new side mission type gets unlocked. After the third cutscene, the player is ready to face the end boss. Other major differences are the city (Hell is new, but smaller in scope than Steelport), the lack of customization (the player either controls Gat or Kinzie) and no licensed music.\n\nCharacter development is identical to Saints Row IV except that new super powers are unlocked by finding and activating altars and flying works a bit different: Kinzie/Gat don't hover like Superman, but have giant wings. This causes them to slow down over time until they flap. They start with one flap per flight, but this number can be upgraded. While most distractions are known from the predecessor (but re-designed to fit the scenario), a few of them are new, e.g. shutting down factories by fighting over three control points. The four available activities are hellblazing (a flying checkpoint race), torment fraud (a insurance fraud variant), mayhem (causing chaos with a given weapon/vehicle) and salvation (husks fall from the sky and have to be collected by the flying player before they reach the ground).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Volition Inc.","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34506,"FileName":"918e92f9-bb00-4a03-aa87-2a4d53405592.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34506,"FileName":"e2322320-5551-4284-b67a-90c13968bee9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":117452,"Name":"Saints Row: Money Shot","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are Cypher, a deadly assassin in the world of Saints Row, and you hunt the most elusive targets with the most sophisticated weaponry that Ultor has to offer.

It is the third title in the Saints Row series. As in the previous games, the player-character leads the Third Streets Saints gang in a turf war against three rival gangs using a variety of weapons and vehicles in single-player and cooperative play. The series, and especially this title, is known for its crazy scenarios and lighthearted gameplay.[2] It was released on November 15, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and later abroad.\n\nGame development began by late 2008. There was high staff turnover from the previous Saints Row team with one-fifth of the final 100-person staff having worked on a previous title in the series. They aimed to improve on the series by giving the game a coherent tone, and found it in films such as Hot Fuzz and the game's signature sex toy bat. Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok physics engine.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic.[3][4][5] Reviewers noted its general zaniness and praised its customization options. Critics thought the setting was insipid and that its humor occasionally fell flat, and others thought the game perfected the Saints Row formula. It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from GamesRadar and G4. A complete edition including the three downloadable content packs was released a year after the original release, and its planned Enter the Dominatrix expansion became the game's sequel, Saints Row IV.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN2-WSyRuO0","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Sandbox","Developer":"Volition","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12328,"FileName":"bc611aa9-6db1-4c0f-b436-30321e71a3eb.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12328,"FileName":"c2015b57-bd9f-4f78-b651-5c63152a38c8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12328,"FileName":"f061e663-3ae3-478e-ad8b-2cc4f3fe8ac8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12328,"FileName":"1b9931f2-33a3-44a4-8828-414471bd63cb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12328,"FileName":"2396bb70-33ae-4b80-8625-900787b401ac.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8176,"Name":"Saints Row: The Third The Full Package","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Features\n\nFrom the ingenious minds that brought you all those Saints Row games comes the ultimate Saints Row compilation.

The Jigsaw Killer has healed his gunshot wound and has locked him up in an abandoned asylum to teach him a lesson about life appreciation. Tapp's primary tasks is to explore the building and find an exit, while avoiding or solving Jigsaw's traps and puzzles.\n\nUpon starting the game Tapp is instantly faced with the task of removing a trap known as the Reverse Bear Trap, a mechanism that is set to go off and tear a human head apart. After getting the trap off his head, he is free to wander a mental institution filled with obstacles such as shotgun doors, broken glass that cuts Tapp's bare feet, and other victims of Jigsaw who are after Tapp because Jigsaw has hidden the key to their traps inside his chest. Mysteries surrounding the films need to be uncovered, there are different characters to meet and it is possible to see the sets recreated from them.\n\nTapp's actions affect the outcome of the game. If he is not careful, in some traps innocents will be killed, and some of those wandering the halls are not violent. Killing them affects the game's outcome, as well Tapp's ability to save others from certain traps. The game has two endings, a positive and a negative. The positive ending is the only ending which is canon to the films, the negative ending is not canon. \n\nPlayers control Tapp from a third-person perspective, and the game has a combat mechanism very similar to Silent Hill: Homecoming. He can use various weapons in the environments, however they will break after being used a few times. Some enemies have traps that may affect their skills; enemies with square shaped traps on their head cannot see but will attack if they can find you, while enemies with dynamite strapped to their hands will explode after death which can harm you, and so on.\n\nTraps can be used against enemies as well; fuse boxes can be switched on above a pool of water and anyone who steps in will be electrocuted, and later in the game the player can re-set shotgun doors and hide from enemies. While progressing through the game, new kinds of traps can be found, as well as new weapons, light sources, and even the ability to create new traps or weapons from junk around the asylum. Some of the larger, more complex traps require Tapp to save both his own life as well as another person's life, and others may force him to make a decision between his own life or the others. These traps are often presented as complex puzzles. The game rewards the player for finding clues and documents strewn around the Asylum, and in many cases Tapp will not be able to escape a trap without the help of the clues.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Horror","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13262,"FileName":"5c4a51a0-ffc4-4f58-9cb4-08bc189335b1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13262,"FileName":"c64ce738-83f2-49fe-86d8-be8a9d944be5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13262,"FileName":"f7db64f0-186b-4099-9b33-b9309c5b3f83.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12803,"Name":"Saw II: Flesh & Blood","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The demented serial killer Jigsaw returns with more gruesome torture puzzles designed to test the limits of human ethics in Saw II: Flesh & Blood.

The girl is able to jump, grapple, and hover her way though seven game worlds, either alone or with another player in a cooperative multiplayer mode.

Roundly praised for Jurevicius' art, ScaryGirl received otherwise mixed reviews upon its release. Critics found fault with both the control scheme and its combat system, although boss battles did receive some praise.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gOTQii5BGA","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16442,"FileName":"c8f212c4-1574-49fb-8693-14235eb50e94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16442,"FileName":"f0f64bef-5d69-40e1-bca4-0b913f293d01.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13263,"Name":"Scene It?

The United States Imperial Forces of course can't just stand by and watch and has send an army into the orbit of the planet. Part of this army: the 8th Armored Infantry or 'Section 8' for short. The best of the best the UISF has to offer. Also known as Helldivers, they are able to jump from a spaceship right down onto the planet without any parachute or other help besides their own full-body armor to fulfill mission objectives deep behind enemy lines. The singleplayer-campaign puts the player in the shoes of Alex Corde accompanied by his squadmates to help free New Madrid.\n\nSection 8 is a multiplayer-focused and objective-based first-person-shooter. Killing enemies, capturing control points and completing dynamic combat missions grant victory points that in the end determine the victor of each multiplayer-battle with up to 40 players. Dynamic combat missions come in six types ranging from escorting an Commando as he assaults an enemy base, deploying an outpost at a strategic location or planting a bomb at the enemy base. To complete his job, the player has access to a vast range of weapons including machine guns and sniper rifles, equipment like repair tools and passive modules which increase his shield capacity or weapon damage. The player can change his loadout not only when he's dead but also on the field at deployable supply depots. In addition they also heal him and replenish his ammo.\n\nSupply depots are either created automatically by the game once certain objectives have been met or can be bought and build by players that have earned enough money by killing enemies and completing objectives. Also available on the shopping list are combat structures which include three types of turrets as well as a tank, a mech-like heavy armor and an armored transport. Except for the heavy armor, all vehicles have place for more than one player, especially making the tank a powerful weapon thanks to it's four weapon systems each of which is controlled by a single player.\n\nThe armor of Section 8 not only can withstand a drop from high altitudes, it also has an integrated jetpack, allowing for short periods of flight and a booster to temporarily run faster. These functions consume energy which is automatically replenished when not used. The drop from the sky, called Orbital Burn-In, which is the way the players spawn, can be controlled to a limited degree. While the spawn-point can be chosen from a map, the players can decide themselves when to engage the brakes of their suit. While a soft landing allows for the player to immediately go into combat and steer a little bit, it makes him vulnerable during drop-down. A hard landing on the other hand is fast but the player then needs a few seconds to recover from the impact.\n\nWhile Conquest is the only gameplay-mode available, there are different types of bot-modes available. Besides playing a game without any bot, the host can choose between Balanced (filling the game to the maximum number of players allowed with bots), Coop / Extreme Coop (all players are on one team, bots on the other) and Swarm / Super Swarm (one small team against a large swarm of hostile bots). Only available in singleplayer is the One Man Army-mode which pits the player alone against an entire team of hostile bots.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zxi0PqkbJE","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7575,"FileName":"655cb07b-da2c-429e-8c30-60123e2b9810.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7575,"FileName":"e9f1a69d-2150-4578-975e-00dcd600906e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7575,"FileName":"03111a7a-ae7c-44ef-9033-05c8f7808193.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16461,"Name":"Section 8: Prejudice","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Section 8: Prejudice is a science fiction, first-person shooter video game developed by TimeGate Studios.

The ship's movement is limited to two axes, but the camera sweeps and the different layers show the environment and objects are rendered in 3D. The game has a dieselpunk theme with robots and floating machinery. The player controls Argus Pytel's ship. He is part of a team of partisan pilots who determine to infiltrate Syriad, a floating fortress that guards the planet. They are after antagonist Ronotra Koss who has smuggled robots and kidnapped a girl of great importance.\n\nThe game is played as a bullet hell shooter where the screen is flooded with enemies and bullets. It is however more forgiving as the standard health mechanic is replaced by a timer that counts down. Each hit drains the timer further, while shooting down opponents extends it. The goal is to reach the end of different sections before time is up. The environments do not only include air events, but are also set underwater. Typically the end part of a level holds a giant boss with strong attacks. The ship has a primary weapon and can collect different powerful sub weapons with limited ammo. Shooting with the primary weapon builds up a score multiplier while the sub weapon resets it. Defeated ships leave behind power-up tokens such as time extension, sub weapon, score bonus, and shield. There are also tokens to upgrade the primary weapon's firepower in up to 9 steps. These upgrades are permanent, but each time the ship is hit a red upgrade token is dropped and it needs to be collected again before it disappears. Additionally a time capsule can be activated to temporarily slow down time in the environment. The player's ship can still move and shoot at regular speed and it becomes easier to navigate through a cloud of bullets.\n\nThe game modes include Story, Arcade, and Score Attack. At the beginning of the game there are two difficulty levels, but during gameplay sometimes an easy or a more difficult route can be chosen as well.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaO1djQMhF4","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-03-31T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16554,"FileName":"a1d0708f-4ffd-4491-8126-0e58d5ad21ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":16554,"FileName":"b7427601-fae0-4c2e-9a9f-ab5d6c27c6d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12945,"Name":"Singularity","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Singularity takes place on a fictional island known as Katorga-12, where Russian experiments involving Element 99 took place during the height of the Cold War.

As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.\nSonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.\nAt Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.\nAt Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn't collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.\nIf all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal. If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":129047,"FileName":"8502c7ff-83a4-4b4e-a2ff-db73dfb47dbb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12331,"Name":"Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing with Banjo-Kazooie","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA.

Shadow's levels are very similar to Sonic but tend to feature heavy use of vehicles. Silver's levels are very different from the other two as they are slower paced and have the player use Silver's telekinesis to navigate levels and solve platforming puzzles.

The game was first released in North America in June 1991, and in PAL regions and Japan the following month.\n\nThe game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. Eggman, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos Emeralds. Sonic the Hedgehog's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.\n\nThe game's development began in 1990, when Sega ordered its AM8 development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by the game's programmer, Yuji Naka.\n\nThe game was well received by critics, with praise given to its visuals, audio, and gameplay. The game was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":129199,"FileName":"c842c1f1-99d2-4390-b71e-1db0ebc83c6e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":129199,"FileName":"19ea4759-570c-4ced-b086-c258191b2ce1.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16643,"Name":"Sonic the Hedgehog 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (Japanese: ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ2ツー Hepburn: Sonikku za Hejjihoggu Tsū?) is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team, with assistance from Sega Technical Institute, and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. It was released worldwide in November 1992. The game is the second main entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the first to feature Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a flying two-tailed fox. He and protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog must stop the series antagonist Dr. Ivo Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds in order to power his space station, called the Death Egg.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991, two months later than originally intended, because Sega of America felt that it was too soon for a sequel. Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development; art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the game's new 3D special stages, based on an earlier tech demo created by Yuji Naka. The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in comparison to its predecessor. As with the original game, the soundtrack was composed by Masato Nakamura.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 was a critical and commercial success. It has sold over six million copies, making it the second-best-selling Genesis game behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog. It has since been released in several compilations and downloads for various platforms, which were also generally positively received. A remastered version was released on iOS and Android devices in December 2013, including new features such as Boss Rush and Time Attack modes, and the 'Hidden Palace Zone', which was scrapped from the original 1992 release. Two sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, were released in 1994.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sega Technical Institute","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16643,"FileName":"38c9fc06-21ef-423e-9994-f3e01c02b299.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":16643,"FileName":"288e46a9-6232-4b20-b36d-be65231fc9c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16643,"FileName":"9f1c8c7e-2057-43e3-8158-3114d83d400b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":16643,"AlternateName":"Sonic 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":129037,"Name":"Sonic the Hedgehog 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In single player mode, the player can choose to play solo, as either Sonic or Tails, or as a team, controlling Sonic, with the AI controlling Tails, which is the default configuration.

They can throw snowballs as a source of extra attack power, collect dropped coins used to purchase towers and upgrades, and trigger a special power unique to each character. These powers range from restoring some of the defended object's health, to clearing the screen of enemies with a fire attack. In single-player, the player switches between each of the four boys, positioning them or taking control as needed. In multiplayer, each player is assigned a character they stick with for that level.\n\nThere are 11 levels structured like an episode of the show. Animated stills voiced by the show's actors set up each level; explaining the objective to be defended, and furthering the boys' search for the mastermind behind the attacks. Players can unlock 12 additional playable characters (with unique special abilities) through playing, as well as video clips from the show in a \"scrapbook\" viewable from the main menu.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"doublesix Video Games Ltd.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181832,"FileName":"c0a7366c-2092-4521-9bf7-69c9d9498a96.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":181832,"FileName":"c71f9801-0de9-4b42-9c13-1a8af31cc886.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181832,"FileName":"38c493d4-b868-4a4c-99e5-2e74a1c16a73.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181833,"Name":"South Park: Tenorman's Revenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An action platformer based on the animated TV series, players play as Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny to take on Scott Tenorman and his army of Ginger robots while traveling through time.

Once the playground for the world's wealthiest elite, Dubai has fallen victim to a series of cataclysmic sandstorms. The city's ultramodern architecture lies half-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city plays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course of the game.\n\nWhile most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the sandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad remained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in Dubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until they picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. Army Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience \"The Line\", that razor's edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line they cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end -- of self and sanity -- when their duty is done and only they remain. \n\n    Deep, Mature Narrative: The story of Captain Walker's rescue mission will challenge players to make tough choices between what’s moral and what’s necessary, as Walker’s journey pushes him to his very limits.\n    \n    Blasted Opulence: The events unfold in a stunning, haunting setting – the remains of Dubai, once one of the wealthiest cities on Earth, now stripped bare. Dubai's bold and luxurious architecture still shines through, in spite of the sandstorms threatening all that’s left. Opulent interiors contrast sharply with the vertigo inducing heights and mass destruction outside of the extravagant structures.\n    \n     Dynamic Sand: Turn the tables on foes by crushing them under a cascade of sand cast down by a strategically placed shot – but beware of oncoming sandstorms and their gale-force winds. The sweeping sands of Dubai feel almost alive, serving as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder the mission, while opening up a variety of new interactions and tactics.\n    \n     Brutal, In-Your-Face Action: Join forces with intelligent, resourceful squad mates in fever-pitched gun battles. Accessible combat and squad controls will get you in the fight quickly, where you’ll experience the raw destructive force of your authentic weapons as well as engage in extremely physical close-quarters battles.\n   \n     Endless Multiplayer: In addition to the single-player story mode, Spec Ops: The Line packs a full range of multiplayer features, including a never-before-seen mode with unique connections to the main story, a breadth of competitive and team-based modes, as well as the ability to rank up, personalize, and customize characters from two distinctly different factions.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Yager Entertainment","Publisher":"2K Games","ReleaseDate":"2012-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12601,"FileName":"4761b663-0aad-489c-be54-ab02f846efe6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12601,"FileName":"96092890-62c6-4f7b-b0a9-e0c5e3f05f82.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12601,"FileName":"b3a38187-3ace-4cc0-b560-3550f282094a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12601,"FileName":"96a0602b-28a9-4d96-8bc0-b8cca58a673b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":12601,"FileName":"9458d128-97fb-4993-9e03-91891655d759.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12601,"FileName":"05ca7144-147a-467e-a4fb-767e0f63f0ba.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32256,"Name":"Spectral Force 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Magic Era: 996.

The goal is to clear as many levels as possible, as fast as possible, while scoring as many points as possible. With this in mind players spend the majority of their time running, jumping, and utilizing 'Splosion Man's signature means of locomotion, the \"splode\", a series of up to three jumps, each punctuated with an explosion that takes out enemies in range. This tactic is important not only for the hilarious affect it has on scientists - literally turning them into cold cuts - and as a means of enacting dramatic platforming moves, but also as a way to increase players' scores, which in part is based on the number of enemies bested. The power to pull off this ability is not limitless though, and must be recharged after used three times in series. Points can also be scored in other ways, including finding cakes, which are 'Splosion Man's favorite food, hidden throughout the gameplay area. As a natural result of the importance of speed, as the game progresses through its 50 levels, action in the game grows more challenging. Players having difficulty completing levels can opt instead to follow the comical \"Way of the Coward\", which after a certain amount of deaths in a single spot allows the player to skip the current level and proceed to the next. The embarrassing trade-off for this free pass is that players start off the next level dressed in a tutu, and of course a less than spectacular score. Additional features rounding out the gameplay of 'Splosion Man include puzzle-solving, 2-4 player coop in both in local play and via Xbox LIVE, unlockable bonuses for use throughout Xbox LIVE, custom interactive soundtracks, leaderboard support, and voice messaging.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGzgOgpYmM","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Twisted Pixel Games","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2009-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20188,"FileName":"e7f3266f-a78f-43d1-817f-6cd7e3642d07.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20188,"FileName":"1b283b6c-0fd7-41d5-b61c-7024e58235bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20188,"FileName":"6eeb9319-89f8-4961-88d6-07a32843d200.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20188,"FileName":"499fdbd1-0205-479b-8015-b08bf8e0f061.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162244,"Name":"SpongeBob SquarePants: Plankton's Robotic Revenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"SpongeBob SquarePants: Plankton's Robotic Revenge is a 3D action-adventure game based on the SpongeBob SquarePants Nickelodeon cartoon series.

A few of the characters from past titles as well as some new ones have teamed up to descend the 9 deadliest mountains. Unfortunately, one of the team members decides he wants all the glory for himself and breaks from the group to make a solo attempt.\n\nGameplay is similar to other games in the series. You play as a snowboarder navigating your way down a mountain as you strive for fast times and high trick scores. As you perform tricks you acquire points which build up your \"Tricky\" meter. You can use your Tricky points as boost to increase your speed or you let the meter fill up completely to enter Tricky mode. In Tricky mode, you score more points when performing tricks. In addition to extra points you also have unlimited boost as long as you remain in Tricky Mode.\n\nIn addition to the standard Race and Trick modes, a new challenge type introduced is Survival mode. In general, the objective of survival mode is to reach the bottom of the run without dying or in some tracks finish multiple runs of the track without dying. There are 9 types of survival modes including; trees, rocks, white out, avalanche, low oxygen, darkness, ice, cold and gravity. These 9 survival mode types are fairly similar and rely on either visibility or health to create a challenge.\n\nThe gear is similar to past titles in that more expensive gear offers greater bonuses to stats such as speed, boost or tricks. What makes the gear different from other titles is that some gear more or less necessary for completing Survival mode tracks. Headlamp for Darkness, Goggles for Whiteout, Thermal Pack for Cold, Armor for Avalanche/Trees/Rocks, Oxygen tank for Low Oxygen, Ice Axes for Ice and Wing suit for Gravity.\n\nThe three game modes are World Tour, Explore and Global Events. World Tour is a campaign mode that follows the story of team SSX tackling the 9 deadly descents. Explore is basically a \"free roam\" or \"play now\" mode where the player can go to any run and play provided they unlocked it world tour or spent in game credits to unlock it. Explore is also a place to compete against your friends scores or times. Global Events are live asynchronous online competitions where users post scores and are ranked against everyone else competing on the same track. Instead of directly competing with live players in a head to head race they instead compete against replays of other player runs. When a player completes a run their path and actions are recorded as \"Ghosts\". When a player starts a new run up to 3 Ghosts are loaded into the track with them. The player can then gauge their performance by how well they are doing against those Ghosts.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Electronic Arts Canada","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"14c63507-db74-47d5-ae9b-df47ac4642ec.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"41ef1c36-225d-4b12-9e4e-5199f5ad7f6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Russia"},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"cb7b6457-4e88-4319-8e86-cd26d4c031f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"14cf9816-11a2-4f3c-af4f-bbe03bc5c6f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Russia"},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"ea4c8441-915e-4a06-8f8d-4768e35afa89.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"00fee266-0670-4926-b0ac-e59671d49b52.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"fdc10111-8290-4787-9795-82d378e6662a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12523,"FileName":"03b42e3b-558c-405a-82f5-b7c593c73aff.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":9370,"Name":"Stacking","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From Double Fine Productions, explore a vintage world inhabited by living Russian stacking dolls as you jump into more than 100 unique dolls and use their special abilities to solve a wide variety of puzzles & challenges.

The whole game is co-op, with an AI player or friend playing whichever character you do not play as. Playing alone characters can only be switched between chapters and not during gameplay. With another player, a drop-in mechanic is supported. The antagonist of the game is the Gorn, an evil reptilian race, who attack a New Vulcan colony through a rip in space. \n\nThe game revolves around a cooperative mindset, with players playing off each others different skill sets. Each character has a distinct set of abilities, with Captain Kirk being a more typical shooter, armed with a phaser with a stun setting, and Commander Spock, a more stealth based character armed with a couple of abilities as well as a gun with a freeze setting. As the player plays through the game, they gain experience by scanning objects, hacking and discovering audio logs. Experience is used to unlock additional abilities for their respective weapons. The tricorder offers many shooting options and the characters have the ability to rewire turrets and hack flying drones. The two characters can help each other out by boosting shields and weapons.\n\nNext to the corridor-based shooting gameplay, there is a space battle with turrets and many platforming sections. Certain stages are set in space, where characters need to dodge debris and a single level contains underwater sections.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggzVL8sKY-s","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Digital Extremes","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2013-04-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18250,"FileName":"16a15642-1569-41b5-8256-b87ec4d257b9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18250,"FileName":"378d40ee-c078-4ebe-8b19-527b53b8d814.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":18250,"FileName":"f640e1c9-203f-45b7-8e92-3b31cd7e70d4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":18250,"FileName":"3865d661-deae-4723-a363-977b3acf3738.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171936,"Name":"Star Trek: D·A·C","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This pick-up and play game allows you and your friends to choose from five classes of starships (including the all-new U.S.S.

Starfleet is growing fast and new technologies have been introduced like the tractor beam or starbases. You take the helm of the starship Enterprise NX-01 which has been heavily upgraded with all the cutting edge technology and your mission is to find a missing Vulcan ship. During the campaign you play get the chance to play all the great ships from the five series up to the USS Voyager under the command of Captain Janeway. All five captains (Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway) are voiced by their actors from the TV-series.\n\nYou control your ship either directly with the keyboard or by giving orders to your helm on a map of the current sector or by marking planets or enemies in directly on the screen. Depending on how good you solved a mission, you earn command points with which you can buy up to 4 ships. They function like a squad. You can either give them individual commands like defend this position or take the lead and tell them to do, what you do. If you aren't satisfied with the actions of your individual ships, you can take over the helm yourself at any time.\n\nDuring the campaign you only take control over ships of the United Federation of Planets and fight against Klingons, Romulans and the Borg. But in skirmish as well as in multiplayer, you can take either side yourself and fight against up to 4 other players or together against a common threat in coop in which each player takes control over one ship of the squad.\n\nAlso there's much fighting with enemy ships, your mission goals include escorting medical ships to poisoned planets or defending planets against incoming asteroids.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRRpDG0xzKY","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Mad Doc Software, LLC","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks LLC","ReleaseDate":"2006-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"a8ff0505-7cc7-4f47-aaa5-8cdb83ec2fb9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"d1175d5f-a364-43d1-af33-35748f591ba9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"9ea45488-555e-444b-9726-54546ca5fe37.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"3c740d9e-203d-4206-ab74-88e90e83a578.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"f6383534-f7af-4cf5-a11a-c82d2c643bbd.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"12d21cac-fb36-4d27-a0ec-c016a5043eb5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7622,"FileName":"fc997c3d-c8fe-40e4-823e-eae5b0ce9c18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135314,"Name":"Star Wars: Battlefront III","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Star Wars: Battlefront III was a video game in development at Free Radical Design starting in 2006, and was to be the third installment in the original Battlefront series.

Despite this, the game was a bestseller in the United States and Australia, with over one million copies sold its debut month. As of February 2010, the game has sold over seven million copies, and it is the fastest-selling Star Wars video game.

Character sprites and backgrounds have been cleaned up, and gems have been given an element and a visual effect to go with that element.\n\nThe core gameplay itself remains the same as the original game: players place gems of different colors into their Tetris-like bin, as fast as they can, in groups of two. The player also receives glowing coloured orbs - if they place these next to a gem of the same color, the orb and all identical colored gems shatter, and any gems above fall. The player's goal is to make this happen multiple times for each block placed, causing 'combos'. The larger the combo, the more Counter Gems (gems with timers on them) are dumped into the opponent's bin. If a player places multiple gems of the same color in a square or rectangular order, they merge together to become a larger single gem which increases the amount of Counter Gems that drop on the opponent's field. Occasionally, a player will also receive a diamond - placing this on a colored gem will eliminate all gems in the player's bin of that color, increasing the potential for combos even more.\n\nSimilar to Super Puzzle Fighter II X for Matching Service, HD Remix includes multiple variants of gameplay:\n\n-   X-Mode: Identical to the original arcade mode.\n-   Y-Mode: Same-colored gems break as soon as there are three aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\n-   Z-Mode: Gems rise up from the bottom of the bin, and the player controls a 2x2 cursor to rotate them and create combos.\n\nNew to HD Remix is X'-Mode (or X Dash-Mode), which is a more fairly balanced version of the original game. Many characters' special block patterns have been readjusted to level out the playing field.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59O4fMhf49w","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Backbone Entertainment","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"64cfbe12-c96e-404d-a6fe-f2ba157b03ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"4667d359-e8f6-4d50-b665-aecbf6aaa61a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"dda498fc-3d3d-46d7-9619-a27f6570daf8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"094778ab-e2c1-4ef3-8d8d-98629f361265.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"641f4c55-7e7b-4fb6-ae15-17387d29a922.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"b1696f89-a570-4260-a1dd-d1f49b641cdc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"002e3eeb-c96b-4557-bba6-ab981d5a768b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157453,"FileName":"f87d9f49-2f79-4936-931a-fdf743960d75.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162238,"Name":"Super Robot Wars XO","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162238,"FileName":"8599e987-bb6c-48f7-a0c0-ebbaa4b37fd9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":162238,"FileName":"ab7a1224-adf6-4622-8a54-2ec96e22471d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16715,"Name":"Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Capcom arcade classic receives a whole new look with Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman's superhero powers to save Metropolis.\n\nIn the game, Superman combats Bizarro, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains (including Mongul) as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS. A port for the PlayStation Portable was planned but cancelled due to it not having enough power to support the game.\n\nElectronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh(Superman/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros. Pictures film directed by Bryan Singer.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version also features games based on the film, but they are fundamentally different from the console title. The games were delayed from their original release date (set to coincide with the theatrical release of the film) due to design complications and issues with polish on the console game. The handheld games were delayed in order to preserve a simultaneous release with non-handheld SKUs.

As a pure graphical adventure game, Syberia follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to become fully immersed in Syberia's universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need to save the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/syberia-ii","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"MC2-Microïds","Publisher":"MC2-Microïds","ReleaseDate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"4b856e6c-f87f-4270-9c83-17c08dfed7a1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"c33d66fc-6ccb-46d1-a283-4f485b357eed.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"267b0926-463e-40d3-a54b-f345ddded934.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"f0f9d6a2-fdf5-40eb-8f15-c4bbbf85421e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"e3174aa3-337b-4fe9-9df2-d25b5c1ed869.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"827643d1-6654-43ae-afd5-34b9de43b008.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"ed99f88e-6d45-4843-b4ba-6a48176144de.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175404,"FileName":"99df984d-2c31-4a9f-b167-8419f9b0cd4b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12146,"Name":"Syndicate","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Set in 2069, Syndicate takes players into a dark, Machiavellian world run without government oversight with many syndicates vying for total dominance of their local market place.

The game sends the four Ninja Turtles out to prevent a canister of super mutagen from falling into the hands of the Shredder and his cronies.\n\nThe game, which uses 3D polygonal graphics for 2D side-scrolling gameplay, is a combination of \"Metroidvania\"-style exploration-based platformer and beat'em up. The turtles' quest will take them through a huge interconnected world, reaching from the sewers to the streets of New York City, the TCRI building and even Dimension X. In typical genre style, only a small part of the world is accessible from the start. New skills or items must be unlocked or found to be able to reach new areas.\n\nStanding in the turtles' way are various goons, reaching from Foot Clan bots over Mouser droids to Kraang soldiers. It is possible to switch between the four turtles at any time. They all use their signature weapons and have a slightly different fighting style and moves. Basic moves are simple attacks and blocks. Landing a hit combo and then pressing attack again sends the turtle's weapon spinning and then pressing a direction launches a \"Shell Kicker\" - an extra powerful move that can knock away an enemy's shield, knock them back, deal extra damage or get the turtle behind the enemy. Defeating enemies gains experience points that allow upgrading of the Shell Kicker attacks. If a turtle is defeated, he is captured by the enemy and it is possible to get him back into the game by rescuing him from where he is held.\n\nNew abilities are earned by finding power-ups or meeting with allies like April or Casey in story sequences. They include double jumps and dashes, as well as the ability to throw various kinds of shuriken or smoke bombs, all of which allow the turtles to gain access to new areas. There are also health upgrades in the form of pizza boxes (for higher maximum health) or pizza pies and slices (for replenishment).\n\nThere are several boss battles against the likes of Rahzar, Baxter Stockman, and of course, the Shredder.

The environment can be scanned to tag enemies and movement includes parkour-like actions to clamber up the sides of buildings as well as parachutes to glide over rooftops. Along the way green orbs can be picked up for Battle Points used to upgrade abilities. There is an experience system and a number of passive skills earned through high ranks in missions.

Players get to control the four ninja turtles Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael as they fight to save New York City from mutants, with familiar adversaries such as Foot and Shredder.\n\nThe game takes the player through a set of linear levels where various types of enemies need to be defeated. The game is always played with the group of four turtles and it is possible to switch between them on the fly. Up to four players can have a go simultaneously in multiplayer and when less than four are playing it is still possible for anyone to switch between the available turtles not controlled by a player. Each turtle has its trademark weapon, a secondary weapon and a specific fighting style. Switching between turtles is also a game mechanic to string together large combos as in a tag style fighting system. Next to combat the turtles can move through the environment by jumping over objects, climbing on top of them or for instance grind rails. A stealth mode can be entered to move around and kill quietly. In this crouched stance the active turtle can also ask the others to stay put and not follow. Downed turtles can be revived by providing pizza to them, available in limited quantity.\n\nThe game offers four game modes: Campaign, Arcade Mode, Challenge Mode and Dojo Training. While playing, additional smaller objectives often appear such as reaching a certain combo or doing a stealth KO, to gain more experience points. Certain areas in the game are blocked off and need to be opened by hacking terminals through a boardgame-like puzzle game to rewrite the circuit. In the workshop, part of their sewer hideout, different types of weapons can be equipped and unlocked. These can also be upgraded through several levels. Each character has four statistics: health, damage, toughness and speed. Ability points are used to unlock individual upgrades such as attacks, defence, finishers, leadership skills, general combat abilities, team attacks and specials.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Red Fly Studio","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27013,"FileName":"137ca9ed-86d4-485f-b80f-16f453be7cce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27013,"FileName":"0081e0f8-4447-4724-bfab-0a7a00456167.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27013,"FileName":"58d8d1c9-7a13-448e-a0df-8333b6e27bdd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":27013,"AlternateName":"Tortugas Ninja 2: Fuera de las Sombras","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":164271,"Name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Turtles are back!

Players lead the ambitious young reporter to explore exotic locations around the world, overcoming perilous situations with clever thinking and agile button-presses. Captain Haddock, Snowy, and other characters can be unlocked, to play through parts of the story from their own perspectives, using their distinct strengths and special abilities.\n\nMuch of the game is played like a 2D platformer, presented in polygonal 3D. Tintin must climb, dash, and make nimble leaps to find his way through each level.

The Beatles software is compatible with Rock Band, Guitar Hero and most other instrument controllers. \n\nJoin John, Paul, George, and Ringo on-stage at legendary shows, behind closed doors in the recording studio, and in dreamscapes that bring the psychedelic imagery of the latter stage of their career to life. The acclaimed Rock Band elements of interactive play and full-band capacity are here as well, but with brand-new additions. One of these is full three-part harmonies, which challenge you to recreate The Beatles’ vocal blend - a first for any music game and facilitated by the game's support for up to three microphone controllers. In addition, the game supports custom-built controllers modeled after the actual instruments that the Fab Four played, and eventually helped to make iconic, audio straight from the masters, and graphics that take you on a magical tour through the key moments in The Beatles history. Produced with the full cooperation of The Beatles and Apple Corps, the game is packed with hidden fab extras that will push you and up to five of your friends to master the songs both online and offline in order to hear rare audio and view unseen photos from the archives. \n\nThe Beatles were one of the most prolific bands of all time, churning out memorable hit after hit and this is reflected in the song list of The Beatles: Rock Band. From \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" to \"Get Back,\" every song in The Beatles: Rock Band comes directly from the Abbey Road master tapes. More than 40 songs are included with the game, spanning the length of The Beatles’ career, with more to follow via download.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFgEmu9ARVA","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Music","Developer":"Harmonix","Publisher":"MTV Games","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10963,"FileName":"43249a15-7d1e-4065-bd6b-ee1bad24c218.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10963,"FileName":"f3850ba0-16b4-4071-8a0f-2c82e3b66c7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10963,"FileName":"2256f976-e801-48f5-b537-16d03b0c9148.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10963,"FileName":"a942e748-925b-40e8-a48b-644843c74423.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16816,"Name":"The Biggest Loser: Ultimate Workout","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Biggest Loser Ultimate Workout is a clever \"exer-gaming\" title that challenges you to work out, eat well and \"weigh in\" -- just like the television show.

Take control of up to eight trained killers motivated by greed, driven by pure insane bloodlust, and determined to earn respect on a global level.","MaxPlayers":"8","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m-ZQcCxMtE","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Bizarre Creations","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2008-02-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15019,"FileName":"16639493-bccf-42c6-a3e2-72c4a7f41f9f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15019,"FileName":"27dc44f5-2373-46f6-83af-9874c0123129.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15019,"FileName":"e59d3835-025a-47f7-a326-9263216f6838.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15019,"FileName":"4b455f21-064c-4853-8dba-eab48ce0aa11.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15019,"FileName":"1969df1f-f9c0-4371-b82c-6cbe0000a81d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200244,"Name":"The Conveni 200X","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Masterpiece","Publisher":"Hamster","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":200244,"FileName":"9b1585ae-bdf4-4eaa-997f-c80192fb7f98.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":200244,"FileName":"38440f1a-b743-4cd4-921b-67d0002f5e46.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":173180,"Name":"The Crew","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Crew is a racing game set in an open world environment of a scaled-down version of the United States.

He is a skeleton marionette of a dead, betrayed cowboy--and he's out for revenge against his old posse who shot him dead and left him buried in the desert. The Gunstringer faces off against any number of wildly imagined \"Old West\" cliches as seen from the perspective of a puppet-focused stage play, complete with a live-action audience (made up of the Twisted Pixel development team, and some of their special guests). The Gunstringer must face and defeat a brothel madam, \"Big Oil\" tycoons, evil lumberjacks, a wavy balloon man, frontier soldiers, frontier Indians, and transplanted samurais.\n\nGame characters run the gamut of each and every kind of puppet imaginable: Marionettes, \"Muppet\"-style puppets, simple paper people, and action figures. Stages and levels are all built and designed around a cardboard-and-paper aesthetic--paper towel tubes for trees, cardboard boxes for buildings, and various other craft or office supplies (like wall tacks) find a number of uses.\n\nAmple \"Classic Old West\" movie-style narration runs through the game adding an element of \"old tyme/Old West\" storytelling to the entire package. \n\nGameplay\nThe basic gameplay runs along the lines of a rail shooter with the exception that, like an earlier Twisted Pixel title, Comic Jumper, The Gunstringer regularly mixes up the gameplay in a variety of ways. Players typically play holding their left hand to physically move their marionette left and right across the game screen dodging, jumping, and moving through various stage obstacles, and the right hand is used to \"swipe\" over enemies to target them, then a flick of the wrist fires up to six bullets at up to six highlighted targets.\n\nGameplay often switches to straight platforming, punching segments, traditional rail shooting segments (without moving the Gunstringer himself), side-scrolling segments--all of which are mixed with vehicle-based segments including a riverboat, a rocket, a stagecoach, and the Gunstringer's trusty steed.\n\nExtras\nThe Gunstringer features a large number of unlockables, bonuses and extras. Players can unlock developer commentaries for the levels, alternate costumes, Hardcore mode, No Fail mode, and other gameplay-modifying tweaks. Beyond this, there are unlockable music tracks, and unlockable videos both showing behind-the-scenes making-of footage as well as humorous \"interviews\" with other developers in the industry, such as Epic's Cliff Bleszinski. Modern industry-standard unlockables such as concept art are also available, along with \"hidden\" Achievements that can be purchased.\n\nThe initial releases of The Gunstringer also included a free download code for Fruit Ninja Kinect, and the first DLC available for free, featuring Lloyd Kaufman of the infamous indie film company, Troma, which is called, Wavy Tube Man Chronicles.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Twisted Pixel","Publisher":"Microsoft","ReleaseDate":"2011-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13301,"FileName":"c599021f-c608-4361-ac1d-ac245780df56.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13301,"FileName":"f4148c9a-6aba-4ba2-910c-3a73dd1336da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13301,"FileName":"457b0ea3-a528-4b95-bd56-106331148b10.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13485,"Name":"The Hip Hop Dance Experience","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Hip Hop Dance Experience is a dancing game for the Wii and Xbox 360 published by Ubisoft.

Mobile versions for the iOS and Android operating systems followed in 2011–2012. A PC version was released on Steam on September 13, 2013. Critical reception has been positive and the game has either won or been nominated to multiple Game of the Year type awards.\n\nThe game is set after the events from The King of Fighters XI and is also the conclusion of Ash Crimson's story arc, which started in The King of Fighters 2003. It follows another King of Fighters tournament secretly hosted by Those From the Distance Land, the organization behind the events from the two prior games that are trying to break the seal of the demon Orochi and take its power.\n\nReleased after The King of Fighters XII, the game was directed by Kei Yamamoto who wanted to bring elements from prior The King of Fighters titles and fix issues from the prior game. This title significantly modifies the gameplay from its predecessor, removing some modes, and adding ones formerly used in the series. It also expands the character roster, re-grouping the playable characters into three-member teams as in the prior installments. The ports are notable for including more content than the original version such as new characters, stages and game modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKZk8ULvlAQ","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK Playmore Corporation","Publisher":"Index Digital Media, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"a49df2ac-aa4e-4ed7-92ef-eee1ed9b8e44.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"abd0d6a0-4e22-4793-beab-2656475264dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"181a0df5-0b27-4b4b-8d3f-e93a148d84d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"0f0b2e02-6642-4e22-847b-f7e3d807e1e6.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"b32ca44f-e8ed-4646-b664-f5d33e34d25f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"70801de1-6f30-41db-99b3-17a38915b47c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8893,"FileName":"065d7af1-4953-4d85-8434-b878dd14d13f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":38,"Name":"The Last Remnant","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Last Remnant is set in a fictional world featuring a number of distinct humanoid races: the Mitras, human in appearance, the Yamas, strong fish-like people, the Qsitis, small reptilians, and the Sovanis, feline people with four arms.

It is derived from the The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and borrows many gameplay mechanics from Pandemic's Star Wars: Battlefront games. The game allows the player to play as both the forces of good and evil, but unlike The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, the latter option is based around Sauron stopping the One Ring from being destroyed and using it to regain his lost power.[2] On December 23, 2008, the PlayStation 3 demo was made available on the PlayStation Network[5] while the Xbox 360 demo was released January 2, 2009.[6]\n\nPandemic was aided by Weta Digital in developing the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy novel, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened if they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.[2]\n\nOn March 16, 2010, the online multiplayer modes of The Lord of the Rings: Conquest were shut down for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[7] On August 16, 2010 a group of fans launched the non-profit CNQReboot servers, allowing users of the PC version to play online using tunnelling software that allows network play via the local area network option.[8]","MaxPlayers":"16","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Pandemic Studios","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-01-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"fa2f1e56-c6aa-4ee3-bf9b-e7b05bd545b4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"8bbd7ae8-b10c-4e6f-ab52-fc2de10add79.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"5138174e-5f3d-4642-90ca-39dab8853dd6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"ba8f1d77-386e-44d1-bdbd-8122a1ca5eac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"88d09b5c-5a63-4a1e-8f37-4cc4cfd305f9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"d95b3c6c-d187-4f3a-a41f-2e3703cc2387.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7686,"FileName":"5ea4933b-67b6-4f76-9767-54fca9ddab0b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7686,"AlternateName":"El Senor de los Anillos: La Conquista","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":7523,"Name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Based on the PC version of the same name, The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle-earth II for the Xbox 360 will bring players into the heart of Middle-earth to live the battles seen in the blockbuster New Line Cinema films and classic J.R.R.

You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy. As such, the game developers call The Outfit \"destruction on demand\". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up.\n\nYou can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn't need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn't nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":"Relic","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7687,"FileName":"5ab95a17-b592-4277-a31a-7d38f7cc4c37.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7687,"FileName":"828ce8a9-556f-4234-969d-14feb4cf9ac7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7687,"FileName":"02ca99b4-b00b-4f15-adf2-903549aeb8ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7687,"FileName":"883a47b2-5629-4ce7-9535-7e98e12e151e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":7687,"FileName":"8a8fd64b-99e3-4191-83ab-d8c2f145e104.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7687,"FileName":"c662fbe3-b650-461a-b7eb-a923e8d39cb6.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14285,"Name":"The Penguins of Madagascar: Dr. Blowhole Returns: Again!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dr. Blowhole is out to take over the world and only Team Penguin can foil his diabolical plans!\n\nJump into an all-new adventure with 3 unique game episodes and over 12 exciting levels.

It is also the first game of the series that is completely rendered in 3D.\n\nThe game starts in a backstage lounge, where the player is asked to help the lovely Jessica, one of the \"beauties\" from the show, to go through a series of \"The Price is Right\" VHS tapes. Jessica will put the tapes in the VCR and the player will be transported into the show, where he/she will bid on several items and compete against other players to win fabulous prizes and money.\n\nIn single player mode, the player will first go to Contestants' Row and bid on the selected item against 3 NPCs. If the player's bid is the closest to that item's retail price, without going over, he/she will then go on to play a pricing game. The player will then go to the Showcase Showdown to spin the wheel. If the player beats the NPC's best score while spinning the wheel (by landing on the highest number, without going over 1$), he or she will then go to the Showcase, just like on the TV show.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete against each other on Contestants' Row, pricing games, Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The player with the most money wins.\n\nThe Price is Right: Decades features pricing games from four different decades; the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and the 2000s decade. Each decade's set from the TV show has been faithfully recreated in 3D. There is one pricing game for every year the show has been on air, up until the year 2010. Among the included pricing games are Professor Price, Plinko, Hole in One, Golden Road, Spelling Bee, Rat Race, Pathfinder, and many others. The Xbox 360 version is also compatible with Kinect and features an online mode.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"Virtuos Ltd.","Publisher":"Ubisoft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13040,"FileName":"febb85dc-99b4-440a-96e1-78a9d9b79d70.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13040,"FileName":"f47a09cc-e698-4700-bcb2-b61c40af4d3f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13040,"FileName":"86342061-d30d-4ed3-a3f2-d2d0a694d5d1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13040,"FileName":"2107fe35-5b6f-4445-baae-74c9da7d0395.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24256,"Name":"The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief Episode 1","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Set across 1960's Europe, The Raven is a fast-paced point-and-click adventure journeying through thrilling and dense atmospheres with the aim of catching the art burglar, The Raven.

The game has no ties to any of the previous games and presents an original story not based on the writer's works. It is set in London, 1898, after Holmes just solved a case where precious jewels were stolen. Upon returning it however, the necklace turns out to be a fake and the detective himself becomes incriminated. On top of that, when he has an appointment with the Bishop of Knightsbridge and arrives there, the bishop is tied up and mutilated. While the player initially controls Sherlock Holmes, his strange behavior eventually will have the player control his fellow partner Watson, who needs to investigate himself whether Holmes is really implicated.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective but it can be changed to a first-person view at any moment along with a fully rotatable camera. The game can also be switched to a classic point-and-click view where clicking a desired location causes the character to move there. The gameplay focuses entirely on the investigations. The environment is presented as an open world with an open investigations where different locations can be chosen and leads can be followed or ignored. Because of the larger scale, characters are now also able to run to travel faster. Items that can be interacted with in the environment are highlighted with a magnifying glass. These can be inspected from up close for further examination or other actions, such as moving an item. Often a close look is required to pick up specific clues. For some puzzles additional tools are provided to get more information out of the evidence. Some of these puzzles have questions that the player has to answer after the examination to gain clues. Rather than wrong or right answers, the player's deduction changes how the evidence can be used afterwards. There are also physical objects to collect that are kept in an inventory. Clues are stored on a deduction board where they can be combined to form leads. Much information needs to be gathered through conversations, where different approaches are available to catch suspects off-guard.\n\nOther elements of the menu contain general documents that provide context, a summary of dialogues, decorations and honors, a map of London, and the ability to switch characters when it is available. When stuck, a \"sixth sense\" system can be used to receive hints. It lights up all items that can be interacted with at once and based on the chosen difficulty level, it has a period of cooldown before it can be used again. For inexperienced players solving the puzzles can be simulated.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFomz6w81c","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"Frogwares Game Development Studio","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12756,"FileName":"889efd7d-ca9b-4b9b-b0f7-7929afe566d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12756,"FileName":"d243447a-4e16-44ff-b95f-231bc6ebdb26.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12756,"FileName":"53d7cf6a-b2c0-416c-a6ac-01675a9da5fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":12756,"FileName":"460a1eac-3213-49e6-b7c8-28a607f2a927.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12756,"AlternateName":"Le Testament de Sherlock Holmes","Region":"France"}]},{"DatabaseID":164277,"Name":"The UnderGarden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Challenge your mind in the wondrous depths of The UnderGarden.

Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York. A mysterious figure calling himself the \"Nightwatcher\" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!\n\nTMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle. Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights. Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York. Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.\n\nSometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on. Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away. If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack. Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged. The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.\n\nThe basic goal for each level is to get to the end. At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected. In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together. Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables. If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins. Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Beat 'em Up","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7692,"FileName":"2931a307-97cc-42ee-a5ae-4450a0dfd13b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7692,"FileName":"4db916cf-7678-4d37-b1a8-25d80422524a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7692,"FileName":"3a0a4ba8-64f6-439e-a8e0-5f1f8d4e0524.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7692,"FileName":"a864585e-703c-431b-bbcc-03198b454e6c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7692,"FileName":"71655fd9-b1b9-45b8-a4d7-6a2a143881f7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7692,"AlternateName":"Tortugas Ninja: TMNT","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":16813,"Name":"TNA iMPACT!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"TNA iMPACT! is the exclusive Total Nonstop Action Wrestling game based on the top-rated weekly television show, TNA Impact!

The sixth installment of the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series, it is the sequel of Splinter Cell: Conviction. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 in August 2013.\n\nPlayers control Sam Fisher, a spymaster working for the Fourth Echelon, in a mission to stop the Engineers, a group of terrorists which is trying to coerce the United States into recalling all of its troops stationed abroad. Blacklist '​s gameplay is similar to its predecessors, with players tasked with completing objectives and defeating enemies. The game endeavors to combine elements of its predecessors, including the action focus of Conviction and the stealth focus of the older games. Blacklist marks the return of the asymmetrical multiplayer mode Spies vs. Mercs, which was introduced in Pandora Tomorrow.\n\nIt is the first title developed by Ubisoft Toronto, a studio founded by Ubisoft in 2009. The game was directed by Maxime Béland, who had worked on Conviction. To prepare for this game, Béland studied reviews and feature lists of the latter. Blacklist is the first Splinter Cell game starring Eric Johnson as Sam Fisher, since series veteran Michael Ironside was unable to perform motion capture for the game. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and its later-announced Wii U version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai.\n\nBlacklist '​s pre-release reception was generally positive, despite criticism of its new voice actor. The game received generally-positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, and multiplayer mode and criticism of dated graphics. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Shooter; Stealth","Developer":"Ubisoft","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"d968eb8e-785f-4b34-b82f-86ddd04890fc.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"bbb88641-d8bf-41df-b694-4462da58ecc0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"cff1304d-94f9-4412-b9b9-094bfa375066.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"11d033a3-547a-4a51-9205-132c0b9bd292.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"c19d7aba-2d76-47b6-bd17-5065d887d595.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"893ad92f-af7f-43fe-9627-b2abca4ef21d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"17f0c64d-e619-4559-a5c2-b859c4385bf9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"e8669303-cc6e-43ed-88bb-02bc2f0cac12.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"5816fe3d-9085-4436-abd0-729de3a64845.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"dd76d446-dd45-40c8-bb30-013db11bee4f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"ce54877f-f98e-4f20-8b41-0844437193f7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17408,"FileName":"b5fc29a0-8802-4c77-8c70-696617048dfe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10917,"Name":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The adventures of Sam Fisher continue in the fifth entry of the stealth-based series.

Double Agent was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 in October 2006. The Wii and Microsoft Windows versions were released in November 2006. A PlayStation 3 version was released in March 2007. Originally the game was set for a March 2006 release, but Ubisoft moved the release date to October 2006 in order to have more development time. Ubisoft then released their fiscal quarter results for Q1 2006 and announced that Double Agent would be put back at least one month in order to boost Q3 2006 income.\n\nThere are two separate versions of Double Agent. One version was made by Ubisoft Shanghai, who developed Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and was released on the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 3. The other version was made by Ubisoft Montreal (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory) and was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Nintendo Wii. The Ubisoft Shanghai version features a completely custom engine while the Ubisoft Montreal version plays more like the classic Splinter Cell games.

Revamped physics and an enhanced control scheme allow for more free-flowing action, while graphical improvements present a redesigned Lara who is immediately expressive, more believably proportioned, and as strikingly attractive as ever.\n\nLady Croft's new look in Legend is based in part on 20-year-old British model Karima Adebibe. Lara now boasts smoother animations, a more realistic deportment, and a number of costume changes. The original Tomb Raider games were popular for their innovative blend of gaming styles as well as for their distinguished female lead, however, and this game is designed to return fans to the winning combination of 3D platforming, environmental puzzle-solving, and third-person shooting found in the blockbuster originals.\n\nWhile the storyline of Tomb Raider: Legend is told around the series' traditional \"tomb raiding\" action, Lara must also adventure through modern city levels, proving her acrobatic skill set is as applicable to skyscrapers and cement as it is to unforgiving wilderness and ancient architecture. New equipment, such as the grappling hook and communication device, offer new abilities. A number of vehicles become available along the way, as well, for special gameplay sequences.\n\nFor the first time in the series, stalwart Eidos studio Crystal Dynamics (Gex, Legacy of Kain, Project: Snowblind) was developer of this Tomb Raider game, instead of the franchise's creator, Core. The designers at Crystal Dynamics have endeavored to apply their extensive experience in the 3D action genre toward reinvigorating one of gaming's most recognizable and beloved characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrFiWrB_D4s","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Crystal Dynamics","Publisher":"Eidos Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2006-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12898,"FileName":"86288b00-3cdf-45e1-9349-8612ad846e8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12898,"FileName":"0edb1d98-957c-442e-a138-e6a2ee7d06a1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12898,"FileName":"adf4ad69-2e7a-4b14-b8f5-2624ed2bd37c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12898,"FileName":"bc0c9821-857f-451c-9d1f-a907a3e873d1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12898,"FileName":"f04d195b-e08a-421d-adbf-2a3391727fb3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12898,"FileName":"730dbc91-4ce9-4f53-9c02-86851db3c995.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12898,"AlternateName":"Tomb Raider: Legend","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":15976,"Name":"Tomb Raider: The Final Hours Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tomb Raider is a 2013 action-adventure video game published by Square Enix. Tomb Raider is the fourth title developed by Crystal Dynamics in the Tomb Raider franchise. As the first entry in a new Tomb Raider continuity, the game is a reboot that emphasises the reconstructed origins of the culturally influential lead character Lara Croft.[4][5] Tomb Raider was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 23 January 2014 for OS X.\n\nCrystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider: Underworld in 2008. Rather than a sequel, the team decided to completely reboot the series, establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time, following Tomb Raider: Legend. Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai, an island from which Lara, who is untested and not yet the battle-hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series, must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult. Gameplay elements focus more on survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. It is also the first game in the series to have multiplayer and the first game to be published by Square Enix, after the latter's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009. Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010, replacing Keeley Hawes.\n\nAfter a delayed release from late 2012 to March 2013, Tomb Raider received much anticipation and hype. Upon release, the game was well received, with critics praising the graphics, the gameplay, Luddington's performance as Lara, and Lara's characterization and development, although the addition of the multiplayer mode was criticised. Tomb Raider sold one million copies within 48 hours of its release, and has sold more than 8.5 million copies as of April 2015, making it the best-selling Tomb Raider title to date. An updated version, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, was released in North America on 28 January 2014 and in Europe on 31 January 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing all features and DLC. A sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, was released in November 2015.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFBrgeSjj-0","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-03-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15976,"FileName":"efcf042b-a020-4af8-8d83-4a91b304d3de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12899,"Name":"Tomb Raider: Underworld","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following the franchise's legendary return to success under the direction of Crystal Dynamics, Underworld, the studio's sophomore production with Lara Croft, aims to maintain the high level of solid, free-flowing action that reinvigorated the series, while bringing back more of the spooky exploration and challenging jumping puzzles that helped define the classic Tomb Raider games of the late '90s.\n\nDevelopers strove to create a smooth-moving, contextually integrated character. Motion-capture technology is used for the first time in the series, with the 3D recordings of a world-class gymnast bringing Lara's jumps, flips, and kicks to life. In all, Lara's movement throughout the game incorporates over 2,000 animations. \n\nIt takes a god's weapon to kill a god. Lara is set on a quest to obtain the power of Mjöllnir, the hammer of the invincible Thor. Lara's acrobatics and cunning are pushed to their limits in elaborate, sprawling platform puzzles set among ancient tombs and ruins in the jungles of Mexico, the coast of Thailand, beneath the frigid arctic seas, and in other forbidden places of mystic power around the world.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Jn3BFa5qU","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Crystal Dynamics","Publisher":"Eidos Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"3a486159-912b-4615-8971-3436bce02541.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"3b8b8346-9c2f-4c49-aaa8-1cb81af8cff7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"12f0d9ab-7bae-4715-82a6-9e4ea756dc18.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"e5daa18f-176c-43df-99f9-1047f2825fd4.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"7ef5bd60-8bc5-46c8-b642-792c29424d3c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"19fffd89-6d28-4a3d-82a3-fddc308f02ee.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12899,"FileName":"9b4f9069-0217-4acb-9701-97a3ad82d408.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162223,"Name":"Tony Hawk RIDE","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Players can experience skateboarding like never before in Tony Hawk: RIDE.

It has the same bright visual style using cel-shaded graphics. The main story mode has five difficulty levels and tells how the Decepticons plan to cyberform planet Earth after Megatron finds a way to control plasma energy. He uses this technique to turn organic material into metal. The Autobots need to prevent this and eventually five different characters are playable: Bumblebee, Grimlock, Optimus Prime, Sideswipe and Wheeljack. Next to the main story mode there is a challenge mode.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to other titles by developer PlatinumGames. The game is largely played as a 3D action brawler where missions are divided into smaller areas with short cut-scenes in between to further the story. The Autobots link light and heavy attack in different patterns to form combos. When a blue flash appears during a combo it can be finished off with an attack in vehicle form. Robots can freely switch between robot and vehicle form. The latter is used to move around quickly and there are also longer driving sequences, often when chasing or escaping. While driving, ranged weapons can be fired and there is a rush attack and often obstacles to dodge and booster portals to receive extra speed. Melee weapons include swords, gauntlets and hammers and ranged weapons are blasters, grenade launchers etc.\n\nWhile fighting in robot form, four weapon slots are available per character. A large amount of melee and ranged weapons can be collected during missions and they can be switched on the fly. Ranged weapons have an energy meter and when empty require some time to recharge. Another meter is filled up by attacking and when full a devastating attack can be triggered, unique for each Autobot. Levels often have hidden items and collectibles. There are transpatial converters that temporary reveal a hidden container in another location. A stomp attack launched from the air is sometimes used to reveal items hidden below the surface. The Autobots can also pick up and throw objects and this technique is sometimes used to solve small environment puzzles. By timing correctly incoming attacks can be dodged, which slows down time, similar to Witch Time in Bayonetta, providing an opportunity to counter. Additional attacks can be purchased later on, such as a parry move where an incoming attack can be countered right away. The game has many encounters with large robot bosses where weak points need to be exploited. After each fight a ranking is shown based on the performance.\n\nDuring gameplay green and blue energon cubes can be picked up to restore health and weapon energy respectively. New missions are always started at the Ark headquarters. The player gets to select the Autobot and can define the loadout from the large inventory of weapons. Weapons have their own levels and can be made stronger through synthesis, merging weapons with a base one and the secondary ones used for parts. The credits currency earned during missions can be given to Wheeljack. He develops T.E.C.H. that provides enhanced abilities. Players need to complete a quick timing mini-game to develop them and when finished they can be selected from a large pool for two slots. Equipped T.E.C.H. can be different for each mission.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"PlatinumGames","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34154,"FileName":"4240cbaa-5756-4552-8028-c7e29879bf20.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34154,"FileName":"64e166d5-889c-4618-bb0b-7b7cc5c98a7d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8325,"Name":"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is a third-person shooter that returns players to the Transformer's planet of Cybertron for the final battles of the legendary war that preceded their arrival on Earth.

The game has a new developer and bridges the gap between the Transformers movie universe and the game Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. It acts as a prequel to both Fall of Cybertron and the movie Transformers: Age of Extinction. It takes place before the Ark is launched in the Aligned continuity (after the events of Transformers: War for Cybertron), but also deals with one of Lockdown's schemes in the Age of Extinction part. At the start of the game an object flies towards Earth, in continuity with the movie, destroying an orbiting satellite and it is spotted by the mercenary Lockdown. The player starts as the Autobot Drift, sent to a burning city to investigate the attack. Lockdown is there as well and he manages to reach the artifact that crashed there first, the titular Dark Spark. When it is in Lockdown's possession, its power makes Optimus powerless to intervene and Lockdown departs. Through thirteen chapters the story takes various characters through many locations based around the Dark Spark then played largely as a flashback in Cybertron based on the games' storyline instead of the movie. For each chapter the perspective usually switches between Autobots and Decepticons and the game does not offer a choice in transformers or a specific faction side as in the previous games.\n\nCharacters players get to control are Bumblebee, Drift, Grimlock, Jetfire, Optimus Prime, Sharpshot, Sideswipe, Soundwave and Swindle. There are about 20 guns in total, including a regular shotgun, rifle, minigun and semi-automatic gun, but also chaining beams, a slime cannon that slows down and a blade shooter (Gear Shredder). Certain attacks are unique for a specific transformer, such as the ability for Sharpshot to cloak. There are both car and air-based transformations, as well as a Dinobat and an Insecticon section. Weapons can be upgraded with bonuses for specific weapons, faster reload and larger clips. By leveling up or completing bonus challenges gear drops can be earned, ranging from bronze to gold in value, and prime for specific milestones. These boxes provide new weapons, character unlocks for multiplayer, Tech (single-use power-ups) and Hacks (gameplay modifiers). The latter two often offer experience multipliers or other advantages. Duplicate drops are converted into upgrade points.\n\nThe online multiplayer mode is called Escalation. Up to four players work together cooperatively to destroy fifteen waves of progressively more difficult enemies on eight maps in totals, grabbing ammo and reviving each other during games. In multiplayer there are over 40 characters to choose from, some with different models based on the movie or the game universe, and also the Generation 1 Optimus Prime. The Wii U version does not have the multiplayer mode. The experience and leveling system with its unlocks is shared between the single-player and multiplayer mode.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Edge Of Reality","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2014-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173706,"FileName":"3108e70a-cc68-4992-88cd-b3fd503795f0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":173706,"FileName":"c01c6d85-6577-4483-be4a-6c14869fe108.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7696,"Name":"Transformers: The Game","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Transformers: The Game is the name of multiple versions of a video game based on the 2007 live action film Transformers, all of which were released in North America in June 2007.

Every year the player gets foreign aid from the superpowers. Several times a year a tanker comes by and transports away export goods like oil (the new resource in Tropico 3) or bananas, also bringing money in. Another way to earn money is to make the island tourist friendly and rip them off while they are visiting. The least of the players income comes from his own people who pay lease, use the available entertainment program and such. How much everything costs is determined by the player. He is also responsible for employing from overseas, if the required expertise isn't yet available on his island which on the other hand enrages the Nationalists on the island. The Nationalists are one of the many groups of people the player needs to make happy besides each individual themselves.\n\nIn addition each citizen is his or her own entity, with their own names, relationships to other citizens, wants and desires. Some feel the need to excel in studies, others seek religious enlightenment, some just want to have a good time. They even take political affiliations and work towards those ends. The citizens do not blindly follow orders, they must be persuaded through meeting their desires, or just pure greed or terror meaning bribing them or putting out a contract on them. The latter is especially useful to keep the rebels at bay but if all fails and the rebels attack, the player's army as well as himself engage in an automatic battle until only one side stands. The game ends if the palace is blown up, the player doesn't get re-elected or the USA/USSR decide that El Presidente has become a pain in the butt. In addition the missions in the campaign feature objectives like have 150 tourists visit the island.\n\nBesides the new 3D-engine, the biggest change in comparison to Tropico is the inclusion of a 3D-Avatar of the player inside the game. Generated at the beginning from scratch or by using one of the pre-existing characters like Fidel Castro, the avatar can be sent around the island, visiting production facilities or construction sites to temporarily increase the production and building speed. The avatar can also be send to the palace where he holds a speech and increases the freedom of the listing inhabitants.\n\nThe game features an editor that doesn't allow the player to create a new island, those are pre-defined or random generated, but instead allows him to build a new challenge with its own goals, events and difficulty-settings. These challenges can then be uploaded onto the Tropico 3-server and everyone can try and beat the current highscore on that map. No other multiplayer-mode is available.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Haemimont Games AD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13852,"FileName":"b18223f1-08fa-486c-8a8f-c53bde40f338.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13852,"FileName":"4c36544f-d5c3-45d9-8700-7212b800ffc1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":13852,"FileName":"432c740e-8a53-4b5b-b271-f2b070ddb382.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":13852,"FileName":"9ef90bd5-8fee-4d62-832a-2af24893f645.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13852,"FileName":"834f3d37-5b63-4414-9450-80776b7eae2e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8894,"Name":"Tropico 4","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Tropico 4 the player takes the role of the dictator of a (fictional) tropical island. The gameplay mechanics are very close to the predecessor Tropico 3: the player builds up the island so it functions both economically and politically. And of course he also needs to ensure his own maintenance of power.\n\nThe start of a game offers the usual traits of games of this genre: constructing buildings which are used for different purposes, e.g. mining, schools, hotels or army training. Those are needed to build up production cycles and fulfill the needs of state and people. Depending on the island it may be needed to concentrate on production or tourism. Later, when the economical basics are covered, the game shifts to politics and optimizations. Different countries will have requests, e.g. building a military base or allowing atomic tests, or the people have additional demands. How the player handles those matters, have a big influence on diplomatic relations and the people's content.\n\nThe latter is especially important because angry people strike or become rebellious. This can result in unwanted outcomes in (optional) elections or even an attack on the palace. This is the reason why it is important to have an army at hand, even if there are no real war situations in the game. The player does not control his army; only his avatar. This avatar can be controlled directly and perform special tasks, depending on his abilities. The game features a campaign with 20 missions (including scripted events with political decisions) and a free playing mode.\n\nThe main additions to the predecessor are a new trading system, 20 new buildings, new disasters and the already mentioned request system.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy","Developer":"Haemimont Games AD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8894,"FileName":"4adeb0c4-13db-4fc4-9847-79097d8cd224.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8894,"FileName":"5c83c4db-6182-4597-9834-ea973cba0938.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8894,"FileName":"6e7de34a-8525-4287-9428-e26f08a561b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8894,"FileName":"9f326723-8320-4fe9-8df4-d68d2a54173e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8894,"FileName":"5608d2f1-c360-4fde-b3d2-2d9c4c955ee9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13844,"Name":"Tropico 4: Gold Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tropico 4 Gold Edition is the ultimate city building experience, including: Tropico 4 and the \"Modern Times\" expansion.

Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures, though a number of commentators have lamented the clumsy controls when mounted.\n\nDeath in the game leads to resurrection at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity.\nThere are various creatures in Two Worlds. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn, although most areas are densely populated.\n\nBeyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of his/her liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or devilishly evil and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests. However, the path chosen will have consequences on the outcome of the game.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUzibCb0JY0","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Reality Pump","Publisher":"Southpeak Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13269,"FileName":"170f3e4d-e5fd-4781-a82e-b71e7215bd25.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13269,"FileName":"96bd604d-2d8c-4f5c-8702-528eefac2d62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12893,"Name":"Two Worlds II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Originally conceived as an expansion to 2007's action role-playing game, developer Reality Pump's follow-up has evolved into a completely reworked sequel featuring a custom-designed graphics engine and an assortment of new features.

This is basically a slightly modified version of the \"be a pro\"-mode from FIFA 08.\n\nYou can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams.\n\nAs with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Electronic Arts","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2008-04-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173707,"FileName":"359a7aae-5564-40d8-864e-530fc381b8ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":14081,"Name":"UFC 2009 Undisputed","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"UFC 2009 Undisputed is an explosive fighting game detailing the action, intensity and attitude of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).

As an update, the game utilizes largely identical gameplay mechanics to the original. However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustments. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aesthetic changes.\n\nAfter the events of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9OqbiRLaho","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"790c5a30-f6aa-4805-b58e-6c0b3473bcc3.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"c10de6a6-1529-43f6-8623-98bd45c9e0a1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"c5287238-291d-4c1f-9626-00616ae77c09.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"86524133-9e4a-4c44-9064-5472b9cf7270.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"e70f8e27-53d0-4e23-ab19-822fa1d0affa.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"4ce33850-5732-43f6-9a4d-ae637bc0e3c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"d3fbf41d-5441-4095-8e94-f0b073e4be0d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"44f7ba37-be3b-4aea-b9e7-4b61025ad02e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"7239427f-636c-470f-9589-5ba76b7b47e4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"4436090f-3843-4f64-96ea-e49ca92bfdd3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"2616ad8c-52d5-42bc-8607-7b6a519e33a1.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"d714c0e6-b4a2-4671-888c-81df22686706.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"87786559-6c92-44fb-b676-931728323089.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"a608549f-6707-4bd7-bbcf-467ff3ed98c0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"ee4e97f0-3899-4c78-ae7a-6e426fc37913.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"819014df-ac6c-47b1-8edc-d034669e48f1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"f1e7a75a-a98d-4248-b7c9-75e264f23311.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"9d6ace64-0120-47ec-ba5a-5d46d59d6477.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"f75e9ab8-2657-400d-930a-4ab5bc734733.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"9abc185c-6656-46bb-af0f-2a719fd78140.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"93a4efb8-bc19-417f-b383-fcb7652360e7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"0734e05e-4022-4648-8361-5d29fe5bb3d1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"fa6d759a-4585-4d4e-86c0-36afab2546da.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"a0aa324e-85fe-401b-acab-44ce88b7dc8e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"8b8ab1a8-be42-4fd8-b246-7e9b4334ca7c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"37d516ba-67fb-446f-9896-0f1c46ab41af.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"086be36c-3b1b-43ac-a208-9854f71e425c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"82626152-14b5-4a84-8b3e-4ddffcbc4a4f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"4bbaff1a-cf98-47b8-872a-c133a2335c59.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13468,"FileName":"40ef1681-b7ff-4c90-b8a1-7027b9a9a764.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23440,"Name":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 combines the best of all the Mortal Kombats into a single cartridge. 23 playable characters are immediately available, such as Reptile, Cyrax, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, Katana, Sonya, and more.

Weaponry and defenses can be modified in true real-time to take advantage of constantly shifting battlefield conditions. Fully customizable tech trees allow players to control the development of technologies that they deem key to victory. Battles in Universe at War: Earth Assault are large in scope and take place in malleable and deforming environments. Deadly sci-fi weapons and alien powers will allow players to destroy cities and whole territories on a global scale.

You can re-order the cards in your hand while you wait for your turn to arrive, and if you plan it quick enough, you can play all your cards in one move (matching a colour or number in order) while calling 'Uno!', all in the space of a few seconds.

Others would call her a mercenary. For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes.\n\nSimilar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slide across the floor or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how \"stylish\" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat.\n\nBesides the normal combat and the action/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat their highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXO7WMbhEMs","Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Artificial Mind & Movement","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":108,"FileName":"89485fda-f037-4f79-af90-0d2e14463312.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":108,"FileName":"5d5f0f8d-f89f-4126-9297-8cb1297dadf5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":108,"FileName":"27a5b41c-8b06-4b13-aec6-2f8ba6fd2b6e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":108,"FileName":"0aa7a82a-eb6b-4d8f-9d0c-4bd6630d2616.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":108,"FileName":"3fe16443-d35e-4bbf-bf20-1dfc5a2f3981.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12520,"Name":"Wheel of Fortune","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Now be a contestant on America's favorite game show in your own home!\n\n\n\nJoin Pat Sajak and Vanna White on the virtual set of Wheel of Fortune.

In the multi-player mode up to 16 players can go free-for-all or play in teams. In one of the game modes, players can organize armadas to attack opposing capital ships. These ships are made up of 3 levels of defence. The player-controlled fighters need to defend their own main ship and attack the enemy capital ship at the same time. After breaking down one level of defence (usually consisting of missiles and turrets), a new level becomes visible, with the third being the bridge, after which the ship is blown up and the game is won. In another game type players defend their satellite in a capture-the-flag mode, or go one-on-one in duels. In the bearpit mode players can watch duels from the sidelines and play mini-games, or shoot at each other or inside the bearpit.\n\nIn the single-player mode, there are new ships to unlock through different modes: training levels, melee battles or missions where only asteroids need to be blown up. Players can choose from 18 ships (9 Terran Confederation and 9 Kilrathi), all of which are upgraded versions of ships appearing in earlier Wing Commander titles. Each race has 3 main ships: a light fighter (Arrow/Darket), a heavy fighter (Rapier/Dralthi) and a bomber (Broadsword/Paktahn), with different variations based on the upgrades changing the ships' design.\n\nUnlike the previous games, the first-person perspective has been traded for a 3rd-person view on a 2D plane, with the third axis only for special maneuvers such as barrel rolls, flips, immelman turns, 180 turns and devices and moves only available for specific ships. There are 8 game maps, leaderboards and achievements. During gameplay, players can collect power-ups that restore the shield or fill up missiles, provide additional damage (hammer shot/cheap shot), or rare items causing wingmen to appear, energy absorption or supershields.","MaxPlayers":"16","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Gaia Industries","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181846,"FileName":"f3a90eea-bd22-44c1-84f1-26886eda4394.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":181846,"FileName":"9e98b450-7b61-42b0-8774-b934192e3aa5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181846,"FileName":"27631274-2cd1-446c-9279-1ad9b8e7bcaf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181846,"FileName":"d2440fa5-73ad-4f3f-9415-4bd6e0e0fc84.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162216,"Name":"Winning Eleven X ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162216,"FileName":"d9e8b508-80a3-4a73-bf03-2848c2ee523f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162216,"FileName":"384ec683-3caa-4305-988c-898be9f6b4d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7703,"Name":"Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pro Evolution Soccer 6 (also known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 10 and World Soccer: Winning Eleven X for Xbox 360 in Japan and South Korea, Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 in the United States) is a video game developed and published by Konami. Released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC platforms and following on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable afterward, Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is the 6th edition of the Pro Evolution Soccer series for the PlayStation 2, 2nd for the PlayStation Portable and 4th for PC. It is the first game to debut on the Nintendo DS and the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 version features improved graphics, but retains gameplay similar to the other console versions. The edit mode has been stripped down for the Xbox 360 release, due to time restrictions. The graphics engine on the PC does not utilise the next-gen 360 engine but will again be a direct conversion of the PlayStation 2 engine.\n\nA Bundesliga license was supposed to be a feature of the game but Konami were forced to remove the Bundesliga license, which means the Bundesliga is not present in PES6, not even as a series of unlicensed teams, with the exception of FC Bayern Munich who were fully licensed with the omission of their shirt sponsor T-Home. From then on, no further games featured the Bundesliga, with the participation of German teams restricted to a few of its teams appearing in separate blocks (like the UEFA Champions League teams without their own league).","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2007-02-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"3366a0a4-114c-4048-b71c-3af1f5c1764f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"b0c72183-879b-4746-876a-21e8474ed615.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"8fb901ba-ebc8-4c93-a856-ca342fc8af64.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"ffe4ce6b-7d62-4165-9f9c-64ec6a3a9e40.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"bcbdfb58-42a7-4857-bd06-967ea2996619.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"51fe4b07-ec25-4cf1-af16-f46bce52ca44.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"7b7c7f25-608b-42fb-844b-85798ad150ba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"98e1dfd1-d8f1-40b6-b962-2a027406583b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"39cc846b-9e4c-4dfe-83de-7d6a02a61f99.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7703,"FileName":"e9baffe1-0538-4b76-88ea-cd5e4b6d555d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7703,"AlternateName":"PES 6: Pro Evolution Soccer","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":173713,"Name":"Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following previous winter sports titles (including the official game of the Torino 2006 Olympic Games), 49Games presents another light simulation of some of the most popular winter sports, including alpine skiing, snowboard half-pipe, ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, luge, bobsleigh, skeleton, figure skating and curling, for a total of 18 different events.\n\nWhile not as complex as the specialized games developed by the German company (there's no waxing the skis, for instance), the game features a solid physics engine, which provides more realism than some of the more arcadish approaches to the genre.

As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket. \n\nHe finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant.

In the game lobby, players are able to choose from a wide variety of different weapons and use them when the game starts. At the start of the game each player is able to control four worms, due to the game turned-base nature, each player control one worm at a time with a set time limit; when the time limit expires or when the worm fires a weapon, the player's turn will end and the opponent will start his turn. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the enemy team worms. There are two ways that a worm can be eliminated. The simplest way is to deplete the worm of its health, that can be done by choosing a weapon, aiming it at the enemy worm, and firing at the opposing team worm. The second way is to knock the worm out of the platform; some weapons provide the ability to push or knock back the opposing worm. Once a worm is eliminated, it cannot be brought back to life and once all four of a player's worms are eliminated the game will end. The team with worms left standing is the winner.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Team 17","Publisher":"Team 17","ReleaseDate":"2011-09-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"a43d489b-9421-4f98-a778-a97ae7b4159f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"57474a46-5d83-4436-84ee-ceee45bfbcfd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"7c6fb23d-9d22-491f-b185-baaf2427ad04.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"088c594b-3b4a-47c1-bdfe-f3ac2a1800fa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"cc6a357b-bddf-4bfd-8544-44e52358c2e7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"c2223693-be1f-4184-a6e7-564756e17097.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":97370,"FileName":"25769326-de63-42ac-ae41-8d57546e910a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22715,"Name":"WRC 2 FIA World Rally Championshipionship","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011 offers an exclusive driving experience as well as the official cars, teams, drivers and co-drivers from the current WRC season.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Milestone","Publisher":"Black Bean Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22715,"FileName":"e654fadc-53db-4d40-a679-73030a6f6e4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27017,"Name":"WRC 3 World Rally Championship","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"WRC 3: FIA World Rally Championship (also known as WRC 3, WRC 3: FIA World Rally Championship 3, 2012 FIA World Rally Championship) is the official racing video game of the 2012 World Rally Championship season.

The player does not have to start at the suggested class, and may choose to start at an easier difficulty instead - however, a lower-ranked player must complete their class before unlocking the next difficulty level.\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay takes place in a sterile white virtual environment, or inside a simple virtual gym. The player is projected into the scene (similar to watching oneself in a mirror), allowing them to easily follow the virtual trainer's moves without taking their eyes off the screen. The Kinect tracks the player's skeleton and grades them on accuracy of performing the activity based on a number of key factors. For example, a squat punch routine will grade the player both on depth of the squat, and on punching - if the player does not do both, they do not receive full credit for the activity. Using the skeletal data, the voice of the game's trainer will guide the player on how to improve, alongside the visual element of seeing their projection not matching the CG trainer.\n\nThe player's active area is marked by a green border within the game. If their projected image ventures outside of the camera's visual range, the projection will start to dissipate and mist away. Game elements will certainly move the player within the green border, but never outside of it. The border is also used as a visual cue during training classes, and turns gray if the player falls out of sync with the virtual trainer.\n\nUsing the Kinect, Your Shape requires no controls or accessories. Menus are driven with gestures, and routines are designed to punch the air, move in place, and similar activities that do not require gym equipment. However, as the player is not required to hold or wear any sensors, they are free to use any items they may have, such as wrist weights or dumbbells. Some modes will recommend when and how much additional weight to use.\n\nModes\n\nPersonal Training is a series of routines devoted to that player's ability and their fitness goals. The player follows a linear, four-week progression of classes at their own pace. Fitness Classes are specialty classes available at any time. At launch, the available options are Cardio Boxing and Zen, with the option to add more in the future as DLC. \n\nThe Gym Games are more \"fun\" activities, and can be played in a 4-player party mode. There are four to choose from at launch:\nVirtual Smash presents the player with patterns of floating blocks to punch or knee. This mode was showcased in early demos, and the player is graded on speed an accuracy.\nLight Pace requires the player to step on moving light targets inside the camera's view space.\nLoop-A-Hoop requires the player to rotate their hips while using an imaginary hula-hoop.\nStack 'em Up challenges a player's balance and requires them to hold their arms outstretched like a platform to collect and balance blocks. After a certain point, a pit on the left or right will open up, and the player tilts the blocks into the pit.\n\n\nThere is no support for online play, but players can link and track their stats on the game's website.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Life Simulation; Sports; Education","Developer":"Ubisoft","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8899,"FileName":"53761a2f-7135-4b16-b6d9-0a4695a39a19.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8899,"FileName":"56d683dd-a073-47c0-aa46-6d91991eca2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8899,"FileName":"c0102cc2-4e29-4e71-8317-6df391bc64e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8899,"FileName":"55c8025c-29f2-419f-9bea-8553e7bed5e5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13666,"Name":"You're In The Movies","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You're in the Movies (あなたがビデオでね Anata ga bideode ne?) is a party game for the Xbox 360 that is bundled with the Xbox Live Vision Camera, developed by Zoë Mode.

Together with his clanmate Rimat, who serves as steady AI companion, he continues to travel through the fantasy world Zenozoik to learn more of the Golem and how to get rid of it.\n\nThe basic gameplay mechanics are largely unchanged: the majority of time is spent in first-person fist fights against one or multiple enemies. Ghat can not only throw regular and charged up punches, but also kick downed enemies or block/dodge attacks. However, most of the special actions and combos use up Ghat's stamina. Sometimes Ghat can find items which are either used for combat (melee or ranged weapons which quickly break) or solving basic puzzles.\n\nThe main difference to the predecessor, which mostly consisted of linear combat sequences, are the open areas which can be freely explored. Besides walking to main and optional objectives (which are marked on the new map) and picking up weapons or health/stamina refreshments, the most important things to find are totems. Those reward points which are used to improve Ghat's statistics in health, stamina, strength and leadership. While the first three are self-explanatory, leadership allows to recruit a second companion to assist in combat. The game also introduces a co-op mode.\n\nWindows-exclusive are the two arena modes with spawning enemies waves to beat. While Colosseum offers no surprises, the Frame-rate arena is made of computer components and puts the player against wire-frame enemies. Those need to be dispatched quickly, because they keep spawning in until the frame-rate drops under 25 fps.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft Xbox 360","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180354,"FileName":"ecfe4301-659d-4c8f-9ae6-eb89b1004927.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180354,"FileName":"a36858f6-7dc5-4e74-baa9-45c951e28695.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180354,"FileName":"fb01c109-edef-4879-968f-8134074b5899.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164294,"Name":"Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the land of Zenozoik, the city of Halstedom is ruled by a powerful clan, one which Ghat has betrayed by killing Father-Mother, the clan's leader.

In the Challenge mode the player has to build a zoo from the ground up with short challenges. This includes designing the environment, building exhibits with important parts such as feeders, bathing stations and various enrichments, taking care of the animals, managing finances and keeping an eye on the visitors' happiness. The game uses a top-down mode for the overall management, a third-person mode to explore the zoo on foot or using a buggie, and a first-person perspective for some activities and taking photographs while exploring, similar to the earlier Kinect: Disneyland Adventures by the same developer. The overall performance is tracked through different status bars with three main colours: red, orange and green. The other game modes next to the Challenge mode are Training mode (ten missions), Freeform mode (no pressure for money or research) and Campaign mode (twenty levels with long-term goals). Up to four players can work together simultaneously in the three main modes to build and maintain the zoo with support for voice chat.\n\nBy doing well experience is gained to level up (zoo fame) and access new possibilities. Many animals and structures need to be researched before they are used (only one at a time) and then they can be used in the zoo. Paths are designed automatically in a logical manner after placing buildings and cannot be edited. Animals include antelopes, bears, binturongs, elephants, flamingoes, fossas, giraffes, hippopotamuses, komodo dragons, iguanas, lemurs, lions, lizards, macaws, meerkats, mongooses, monkeys, pandas, peafowls, rhinos, sloths, snakes, tigers and tortoises. There are multiple varieties of a single species. The Xbox 360 version contains about 65 animals and the Xbox One version over 100. Information about each type of animal is stored in the Zoopedia. All adoptable animals have a level between two and fifteen. Once they reach the highest level, players can choose to release them into the wild. Buildings have levels as well (up to three), for instance allowing you to hire more staff and providing upgrades.\n\nThe game supports Kinect for some activities tied to specific animals. A hose can be used to wash animals, you can pick up fruit to feed them, and baby chimps or lions will attempt to mimic your facial expressions.
