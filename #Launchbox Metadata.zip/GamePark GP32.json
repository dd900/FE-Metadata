Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.\n\nMini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.\n\nThe game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people.

The graphics are reminiscent of the artwork in the Metal Slug series, with large enemies and giant bosses at the end of the levels that take most of the screen state. As in most titles of this genre, the game is divided in stages with a unique boss enemy at the end. The player controls one of three bizarre characters: a girl inside a flowerpot called Evian, the red demon Bastylo or a wizard named Night Moon Shine.\n\nAs they fly around shooting at the oncoming foes, each successful hit increases a charge point meter at the top of the screen, below the health bar. This accumulated blue energy is used by the secondary weapons, that can be selected at any time to switch to more effective and powerful shots. Up to two players can cooperate in Arcade Mode, or compete for points in the Versus Mode.","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseYear":2002},"128245":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A&B Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"0b424864-5bec-4360-924f-c13e0106ee42.png","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fa3fe3a1-bfdd-4b86-991f-c17a5402a5dd.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4944efda-cf1a-4e75-9f8b-c3583e0eabf2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d42edc99-3a2d-4ac7-a798-d6fcd1d0157d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c21f394b-e277-4199-a3b1-3a9b445d686e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e71387d3-add1-465f-934d-55cfc6b2e6e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"W.B.W.: Wanna Be Wizard!","Overview":"Wanna be Wizard! is a Role-Playing game, developed by A&B Soft and published by Gamepark, which was released in Korea in 2004.","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseDate":"2004-10-27T00:00:00-07:00"},"128246":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FZ Media","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"25b12786-7c60-4cf6-a517-ba398181453c.png","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2e41df54-c287-40de-a060-8b3c7d9fba48.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0df1fbb1-fd63-4245-ab9d-e6406d2620bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"00747341-5d8a-473d-912f-89dd72047a31.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"65bcb27c-a3ab-44d5-8ffa-997bee0c22bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizard Slayer","Overview":"Wizard Slayer is an Action game, developed by FZ Media and published by Gamepark, which was released in Korea in 2002.","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"128247":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gamepark","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"1de83cf6-6291-4c8c-8249-14eecedc2fd3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56e559de-96a2-46f0-bde9-cc89b9cf1b02.png","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73c21cfd-1a74-403a-aef9-3dc0a0046d04.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"292995cd-1d07-4ac8-a963-747a64fcc0c2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d0435675-573d-42c2-aa27-538807159442.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6511c9fc-cc0e-455a-aee3-7fc0b13cf724.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Woody & Kunta: Treasure Island","Overview":"Woody & Kunta: Treasure Island is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Gamepark, which was released in Korea in 2002.","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseDate":"2002-01-21T00:00:00-08:00"},"178472":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Logik State","Images":[{"FileName":"beee97fd-cb0e-45c7-b613-2eee47f92076.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f14b51b1-dcbc-4062-9116-e8b68a338a03.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1b0b65d2-4b79-4fae-847f-834c1279674e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pinball Dreams","Overview":"Pinball Dreams is a pinball simulation video game originally developed by Digital Illusions and released for the Amiga in 1992\n\nPorted to the GP32 by UK developer Logik State and released in October 2002 with Gamepark.","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2002,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pinball_Dreams"},"190165":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"af6cce2d-1416-4960-9cdc-6750490a02fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"054e4615-fc0a-4a1a-8cae-f99c9d6f325e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Funny Soccer 2002","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2002},"190166":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Aeon Flame","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ebbd360e-fea4-43c0-b1d8-6eda07904b73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"93a32d38-f173-44bf-b9a0-269b93e7347c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Gloop Deluxe","Overview":"A puzzle game for the GamePark 32.
