The graphics are reminiscent of the artwork in the Metal Slug series, with large enemies and giant bosses at the end of the levels that take most of the screen state. As in most titles of this genre, the game is divided in stages with a unique boss enemy at the end. The player controls one of three bizarre characters: a girl inside a flowerpot called Evian, the red demon Bastylo or a wizard named Night Moon Shine.\n\nAs they fly around shooting at the oncoming foes, each successful hit increases a charge point meter at the top of the screen, below the health bar. This accumulated blue energy is used by the secondary weapons, that can be selected at any time to switch to more effective and powerful shots. Up to two players can cooperate in Arcade Mode, or compete for points in the Versus Mode.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"GamePark GP32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Seed9","Publisher":"Gamepark","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"4b497664-981a-4722-b3bc-d51c9016a3f0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"a53dce34-402f-46b8-8669-732d8bc6b822.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"69b381ea-0463-4974-922f-fd5b2f16f536.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"c95dece3-593a-4734-a651-8c36aeaa99b5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"d794df5c-ba5d-4791-a614-c7f470c2c6c0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"c65dd681-b37d-45dd-a3e5-cb2908704497.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"c2710d63-204b-4ea6-9cad-3e6b0d714e51.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"e990896b-99ff-4924-a05e-ae7bd23cd4e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"424cb5f9-04b7-4f99-9ce3-4f39ba799943.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"e3133d88-33c0-471d-8ff1-792c26e4942e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"b3ff6318-7d39-4476-bf6e-59dcc8981224.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128232,"FileName":"8df7d482-b875-4e2a-a89c-2524ba979902.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128245,"Name":"W.B.W.: Wanna Be Wizard!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wanna be Wizard!
