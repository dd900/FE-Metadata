This version is one of the first to feature a full campaign mode, and takes place during World War II with the player commanding the German Nazi army, starting with the invasion of Poland in 1939. Depending upon the outcome of each battle, different paths might be taken that can diverge wildly from historical fact.\n\nThe game plays out on the hexagonal grid that the series is known for. As always, each space on the grid is a specific type of terrain, be it grass, mountains, or sea; different types of units like infantry and tanks can be moved about the spaces and attack each other. Different types of units have different strengths and weaknesses toward each other, which is also affected by the terrain. The ultimate goal is to capture all of the opposing cities.\n\nIn addition to the scenario mode, there is also a \"standard\" mode where any map in the game can be freely played with any combination of human and computer players.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUMJZ3FtS_w","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"84e8127e-4b0c-41af-a94b-cb67087b885f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"8e78860d-265a-4351-9d80-353cef8100d0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"3d9b2dd3-7e53-4ddb-a142-562bae022aaa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"d7b91dec-81b1-4a6e-ab7c-287804a539d3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"39dd804c-6679-4c3d-a25e-2f61893ddf92.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"fa029da1-704e-4b05-8354-40194137ead9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"a0f2c8cf-e2fd-4806-9acf-c84c304cc75c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"56d98da8-4548-43b3-9d87-b542b33c8a17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"FileName":"99442bc4-63ff-4f89-9559-abe5a0ba824d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33622,"AlternateName":"Advanced Daisenryaku: Deutsch Dengeki Sakusen","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33622,"AlternateName":"Advanced Military Commander","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":33624,"Name":"Adventurous Boy: Mao Xian Xiao Zi","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"Adventurous Boy: Mao Xian Xiao Zi (冒險小子) is an unlicensed Fantasy Zone clone, though features completely original graphics and sound.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF3dtqr5AWc","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Gamute","Publisher":"Gamute","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33624,"FileName":"9ae07a70-26b5-4f5c-b8f2-ed4ec1ce6712.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":33624,"FileName":"71eafcfa-dae2-4395-ab0b-27fa0335b7d2.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":33624,"FileName":"7d97284e-cf2b-469e-9be4-1616dcb6d7c7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":33624,"FileName":"df500d98-0340-4f30-b085-953996a6ea74.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":33624,"FileName":"4f83e0aa-5b2d-4a3f-9375-0c516d42f96c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"China"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33624,"AlternateName":"Adventurous Boy: Mao Xian Xiao Zi","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":33624,"AlternateName":"Adventure Kid: Màoxiǎn Xiǎozi","Region":"China"}]},{"DatabaseID":4237,"Name":"Aero the Acro-Bat","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Step right up to the acro-batiest show on earth!

The mutants are now lead by the evil Xi-Tiger who had turned them to terrorism, and one of their goals is to kill Epsilon-Eagle...\n\nAt the start of the game the player chooses four out of six weapons - each with special advantages or disadvantages against certain enemies.

They must not falter in their quest, or the diabolical Castomira will assume absolute power, and darkness will reign... forever.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/NMiUraIsWkQ","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Renovation Products, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"18c6d3c0-481f-418c-b2d4-9993a8493eda.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"90da3f31-0261-4c3b-b280-ad15f9bbbe87.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"c7ebf479-6819-4863-8618-20afbbf86261.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"d73fb153-03de-4c91-845a-f71af1173bf6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"83cda5ad-868b-432a-844e-8a8dcca772ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"80fccbb4-ec9b-4b0d-b341-94d691474edc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"fd589574-fd15-4f62-85b5-f1845a3c2bbf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"ad84141e-12ed-4185-a5f4-4402c0de8db2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"3916ed7a-ba0e-469b-8ffe-a846812c0e4c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"8b7c377b-abbd-4fd9-9cd1-a071214241c8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"be0a126d-a567-4095-b502-d70bb7e05b54.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4248,"FileName":"d253a211-5ea6-4ff0-9330-fb422abe2d74.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":449,"Name":"Ariel the Little Mermaid","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"King Triton and his daughter Ariel battle the dangers of the deep to save the kingdom.

When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVW9PxHAZ0","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"99cf4190-b67a-4174-9281-3766b787b3bc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"37c7ae5f-8987-4930-8263-f61a52f8962b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"1d06d16c-e76e-4091-bfd4-49a5c27f7b9b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"5ca8a707-bb17-4495-847f-37fcc634d535.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"9c3c6749-f331-44ba-8c5d-abc421b4c527.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"d2877ffd-51df-475f-8e2f-c3e54b97620c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"35b253a9-60fc-4ac4-83cd-9fdb16600c43.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"48ddd304-ea6b-4fdc-9fcf-395b27860e24.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"3f79c661-d635-4afd-aeeb-36a92badb4c3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"f5328e02-f630-401f-8133-587d9a07482f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"34ecd263-aa81-4c60-9eb7-c4279c0bd5f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"802ee1a7-7add-4cab-abab-25ff87cb9f7c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"3ea63669-4d7d-493c-b9ad-d0ab637abe49.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"cfdec249-6e4b-47cd-923e-27d31abf63db.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"dd008fa6-eba3-4047-9526-888f7bb7262f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"d47a5ac2-a36c-41c1-98ff-3a37cbcb85bc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"73ec4fd8-8214-47b5-9585-6488ab2d6e4e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"9a954632-e738-4f3e-a499-9bd40f973971.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"6fd1cf24-4a7b-4d81-b3cf-ec13a27ebd94.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4250,"FileName":"25329c1a-151c-476a-959e-047476f773b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4250,"AlternateName":"Ryuuko no Ken","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"AlternateName":"Ryūko no Ken","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"AlternateName":"Art of Fighting","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4250,"AlternateName":"Art of Fighting","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":4251,"Name":"Astérix and the Great Rescue","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It is 50 B.C., and the entire Gaul (today's France) is conquered by the Romans.

Two robot crabs, piloted by men seeking fame and fortune, face opposite each other in an arena. Behind them is a conveyor belt with large metal balls rotating around. The goal is to capture the opponent's balls and hold them until their timer runs out. Each crab has two claws which operate independently; they can be used to grab balls from the opposite side of the screen, as well as to knock them out of the opponent's grip. The player must also be careful, as taking a hit from behind will damage the crab, and if it takes too much damage then the crab must return to the pit area to be repaired.\n\nThere are several game modes included. The main focus is the World Championship mode, in which one player takes on a succession of increasingly skilled computer opponents. Also available is a two-player versus mode with a number of handicap options. There is also a training mode where the player can freely practice to get a feel for the controls, as well as a time trial mode where the goal is to grab as many balls as possible within the time limit.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsRq7ol3wKE","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"cfee5ef6-3ee0-43a7-924d-e4fdd08d0373.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"29ec9ce2-ca3c-40de-b624-e83dca145fc1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"87168b6c-9f36-4720-8337-0390f3943964.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"5e733aaa-8ab3-48d9-88be-a503e2eeec9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"93997449-a701-40f9-bcfa-db05ac8daf3f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"921ad705-0f76-4f5b-a2c7-0a1d24f3b650.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"dc371850-e788-4e77-8fa8-8ab2c0b3aab5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"1901bbd3-44cb-45d8-87ab-7be6844aab4b.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"de8da11a-79ea-4d84-a223-726c6f20d242.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"03a0f58d-5266-4c87-a12a-ebaa47659bf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33933,"FileName":"6cc45189-3ba0-4729-b1ec-eeeaa33e466d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":451,"Name":"Ballz 3D: Fighting at Its Ballziest","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"What is Ballz?

The options are a strength test, knocking down cans and a hit-the clown game. In the latter two, players can aim balls with the d-pad, then throw with the action button. Leading targets is required. The strength test has a mater that goes up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the indicator is on the bell to ring it.\n\nIn Wyoming, Barbie goes camping. First, she must assemble her tent. This is essentially a jigsaw puzzle. Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike. In the next segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path and hit the action button to take photos. This requires good reaction time.\n\nThere's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses. The horse runs on its own. The player pushes the action button to make it jump. There are numerous gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them. If they hit too many, they must start over. There is also the option to play horseshoes. The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action button when it passes over the stake.\n\nIn Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge. This game allows both players to play simultaneously in two-player mode. Barbie and Midge can move forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball. First one to ten points wins. There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an underwater maze to collect sunken treasure. It might remind some people of Barbie's Ocean Discovery.\n\nFinally, there is Barbie's home in California. Ken has hidden presents around the house and Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yGnStGEUF4","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"c88ced60-8f3d-402b-b1a0-4f95f40bc8a0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"fe7a3e65-8a70-4a86-bee9-4de9fd9fcc55.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"afafd6ab-9321-4da1-90e6-60fc627eb33f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"ec6ee0df-c19a-437c-8668-e69749b9db36.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"e9ae3395-7b14-479b-907e-d1892b763285.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"d0dd4381-11f8-4a9a-890f-33d44c8f4260.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27454,"FileName":"d0281b31-4152-477c-892a-1fa3e6d141c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4274,"Name":"Barkley: Shut Up and Jam!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hey, any fool can hoop in some stupid gym.

He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.\n\nBattle Golfer Yui is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Sports","Developer":"Santos","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"6c2ac317-bf8f-4e95-aa35-2967100c4ba8.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"3116d3d9-6cc3-44b6-8d93-9eb7c37b00e8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"7b9e9662-6d38-4c45-8629-bcc4f60e156c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"c95fa23f-148d-4685-985b-d32443144b0e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"7f77b517-b9b6-49b4-9e81-42bd5defdb22.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"2f34aeac-a7fc-4e0e-b1d3-6d957b322cb8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"508be9ef-9883-4c6a-89b7-78b6ee3ac0cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"6ad590a3-d8f9-4b7a-b617-a6bc1ce768a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"62f83627-5b79-42b9-824a-a1469f4715ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20299,"FileName":"86062730-7c85-4a17-a46a-fabfc9a890e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33935,"Name":"Battle Mania Daiginjou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Battle Mania Daiginjou is a comical anime-themed scrolling shooter, and the sequel to Trouble Shooter.

The generals told him there was a mortal woman in the empire whose beauty matched that of Nü Wa. After prolonged searching the Emperor's men found the girl and brought her to the palace. What they did not know was that the girl's body was possessed by a fox spirit. Since she became Emperor Zhou's wife, evil has entered the empire. It is time for the great heroes of China to free the country from the corrupted Zhou and his possessed wife!\n\nThe player initially takes control of one of the heroes, Lin Yun, who gradually re-unites with the other eight. The game is a strategy RPG which consists of battles and cutscenes to advance the story. Navigation is possible only during battles, or as instant travel between locations on a world map. During the battles, the player moves the heroes over the top-down battlefield, attacking enemies physically, defending, or using magic whenever enemies are in range.

In the tournament mode, 16 teams compete for a chance to win the national championship. The player also has the ability to edit teams and players. The game itself is not realistic, as players can easily make full-courts shots and occasionally, players get struck by lightning as they dunk. The final score of the games are usually in the middle to high 100s.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Iguana Entertainment","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":687,"FileName":"93d83875-cb6d-4551-bebf-57d43c2444aa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":687,"FileName":"b68744d4-3ba8-4320-b707-fc63f6bfa305.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":687,"FileName":"b8d77273-b75b-4bc2-90d1-4551f085a961.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":687,"FileName":"7b5d7691-4ee3-4839-8111-db647f634e57.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":687,"FileName":"28b00c0f-60e4-47e0-911f-5d26ec487eac.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":465,"Name":"Columns","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Drift back to ancient Phoenicia and challenge yourself with Columns, a game favored by middle eastern merchants.

Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.\n\nArashi o Yobu Enji (\"A Kindergartner Called Tempest\") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.\n\nAlso included is a mini-game mode with eight different mini-games, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school.

One day, her pony friends decide to make a party in a nearby castle. But an evil witch has captured and imprisoned all the ponies. The only pony who is still free is Crystal Pony. She must now carefully explore the surroundings, find gems that are scattered in various places, and use them in places where the ponies are captured to release them.\n\nYou navigate your pony through various locations, collecting horseshoes on your way and \"paying\" them at level gates to pass to another location. You can explore the locations in any order you wish, traveling directly between them or using teleportation pictures. The game has more adventure than action elements. Crystal Pony cannot die in the game; if an enemy hits her, she merely loses one of her horseshoes. The only battles are against the witch, occurring every time you use a gem at the correct place.

The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yōko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.\n\nMamono Hunter Youko: Dai 7 no Keishou is a side-scrolling action game with platform elements along the lines of Valis series. The player controls Yōko who is equipped with a sword, which she uses to slash enemies. If the player holds the attack button a shield is created, which will block weak attacks. The shield can also be thrown to attack enemies.

After defeating an opponent, they will give you the phone number of the next target that must be interrogated, which doubles as a password. There are six different opponents to play against in total.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYUqhTUz35Q","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Studio Fazzy","Publisher":"Studio Fazzy","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":115067,"FileName":"1dc9dc64-7530-456e-ab15-2e57a87e4859.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":115067,"FileName":"613f4fc0-0cb8-4423-aa14-b4a8597bf851.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":115067,"FileName":"eeb037c6-68c1-41f2-bcc4-0b31044cbf04.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":115067,"FileName":"811aa861-f025-4070-b655-2726d9ede6e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":115067,"FileName":"4251a35d-bffa-411a-bc5c-778b9b3cc00b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":115067,"FileName":"82c13aad-4bad-4445-9eb5-7f1e256aea53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":115067,"AlternateName":"Dial Q o Mawase!","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":115067,"AlternateName":"Dial Q Wo Mawase!","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":113655,"Name":"Dick Tracy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are Dick Tracy, a police detective who enjoys a peaceful life with his wife.

The people of the city were living in fear of the Black Warriors, a criminal organization that has acquired tremendous influence. On the outskirts of the city also lived twin brothers named Jimmy and Billy Lee, who were running their own kung-fu gym.\n\nOne day, the Black Warriors were gathered on a certain spot after their usual rampaging of the city when a young woman accidentally stumbled into their meeting. The gang brutally murdered her without mercy. Her name was Marian, Billy Lee's girlfriend. With his older brother Jimmy, Billy sets out on a mission to get his revenge on the Black Warriors.\n\nDouble Dragon II: The Revenge is a 1989 side-scrolling beat-'em-up released for the arcades by Technos. A Sega Mega Drive version was produced by PALSOFT in 1991. Unlike the earlier NES version that was developed in-house by Technos, which was a different game with a similar plot, this was intended to be a more direct conversion of the arcade game. While this version ended up being exclusive to Japan, other Double Dragon games (including a port of the first game) were later released for the Sega Genesis by other publishers in North America and Europe (which were conversely unreleased in Japan).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdwtcax4gnY","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Beat 'em Up","Developer":"PALSOFT","Publisher":"Palsoft","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"0f042fee-3101-417f-ba16-7b571d6dacf6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"60581b9c-8437-4a81-85ae-920f3466728d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"346dc42e-0494-496a-8e95-ec2d0175071c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"16c9bb7f-2e5e-4350-bc85-f3febc1f58a9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"f9a9c8bd-93e3-496e-906b-bbcc4e9567ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"8f952e11-a5c5-4d5b-8a14-07b8fe9d6e69.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"d9aa508e-0eab-4e05-9f13-5681d090ad14.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"3c0dc73a-a080-47f3-a234-b8d2089824f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27518,"FileName":"2db29ef3-89cb-4f25-8219-857e6adfd5ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4343,"Name":"Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Double Dragon returns, this time as a VS. fighter, in the same mold as Street Fighter.

A Sega Mega-CD version was also announced, but even less is known about that version.\n\nThe game re-emerged as DinoBlaze: What's the Rumpus at CES 1995, this as a planned 3DO release, but it too was cancelled.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Beat 'em Up","Developer":"Bonsai Entertainment","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"18c3c249-6dde-4fc6-adb6-48fbe0eb363d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"bc15011b-ad8c-4ecd-8526-5cf9c4baaf57.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"624c82ab-178a-4181-bca2-ca12e4af62b4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"d2bb6fd4-24b8-4b5d-9f64-2c876d7ef1ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"cfcb6cb5-1eeb-40c7-b29b-9900a20dd409.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"15fac4b0-0108-405e-9a40-afd218382e52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156788,"FileName":"49ea3ed4-9f71-4204-8e45-6c804ed99d48.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20366,"Name":"EA Sports Double Header: EA Hockey + John Madden Football","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"EA Sports Double Header is a compilation released in Europe.

Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...\n\nThis is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl.

The game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the top of the screen.\n\nPlayers can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m0DKzJiloE","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Acme Interactive","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"47615316-fb41-4d29-b992-398656cffcda.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"6cb21b93-8b4c-4914-b929-60d52d69c629.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"1ba9724a-0534-433f-8783-f92a7b7a3cab.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"7236546c-37e1-4b47-adf0-a13772346593.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"9de3b242-0b38-4f18-a91a-b3aa7f2434ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"4bdf987f-32e6-45c6-bd82-d8e27d09b653.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"90cc97f1-9311-4535-8e66-ab66c49da35d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"c8c0d6a1-6bfe-4f43-b2dc-7bdf68d4adad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"9b5cdf6b-42dc-4ac6-b4f5-dc16ebfdd7bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"079cc894-59d3-495b-9d16-14b9fda9184e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"4b613990-8ef4-494e-8725-bc89086233de.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"b652a398-0a58-41b9-9736-d24def473f29.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"21bec484-1346-479e-8ce9-b9c3f646058b.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"3ac5f648-3b48-4357-aefe-7e4916f9fd26.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"2e6fec27-a2e1-4e0b-afcd-32979388e891.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"485207c3-4a55-462e-99da-fab1a2aafbf3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"005ef4e7-c8ee-4ff2-ba08-7a9095acb347.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4362,"FileName":"37d87a6f-8127-467e-845c-f0d536589dd1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4362,"AlternateName":"Evander Holyfield's Boxing","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":4363,"Name":"Exile","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After Sadler defeated the Caliph, he returned to his home village, greeted by his fellow assassins.

You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time. This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh3G5mWVj-E","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Raising Hell Software","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"1d10aa46-d43e-4cb4-ab05-64dda2da0cca.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"23e113dd-628a-475e-8164-70dd89df313f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"b7f11865-0363-4c7d-b7d9-3244b294ab7a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"1ab205e6-bd65-43b9-a69c-4116ce48ba23.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"304cb5cc-178e-47f4-9cdb-052fcc5a7fa8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"5613ce68-355e-4aaf-b915-29841a504e71.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"36f6c3a2-21f3-4511-8832-1e60473f7566.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"b67045ab-5157-449b-92bb-abf3ec171529.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"77720827-2fea-4525-9806-ac49d6dd21f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"dfdf8646-6cf6-46f7-b8ef-a589056a01af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"16214412-c5da-4a9c-960f-03592cc38289.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"c2ddb436-61ac-4a8d-a7c5-aa91df10febe.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"ee491487-4c33-46b1-a7d7-61840429d01c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"e84951d2-d33a-4001-9d93-4081c924c2a1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"7b6dd9f4-c4ca-4a3e-82a9-844b13f469d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":478,"FileName":"e733829c-0731-4834-ad8a-d870339a4fa8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":478,"AlternateName":"Fatal Rewind","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":478,"AlternateName":"The Killing Game Show","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":478,"AlternateName":"Fatal Rewind","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":172044,"Name":"Fatal Smarties","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Uh-oh, the occultic ritual-performing locals have taken things out of control, and they've caused a timeloop of never-ending days of ritual!

The game modes include matches for one or two players and a watch mode to view a computer-computer fight.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW_CCROD5jE","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Aicom","Publisher":"Treco","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"88ef6663-b08b-4fa5-b77f-ca5f691de34e.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"88ef9e90-7e59-41fe-afda-c58910d34a6f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"cc6f2114-4aa1-4e43-b16a-e535e1753a57.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"d05daecc-7ac7-4fc1-b5e6-69fd7810a277.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"8c918993-8d84-42d7-aec1-7697e64f2f36.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"bf12457c-90c3-4527-a617-b595d50ad879.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"e886e4a1-9649-439a-88b5-a7bea82e129d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"6d9e273e-a012-4c96-9d42-3caed831b6ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"c68008a2-a11f-4d99-8181-91c56ff6c517.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"6f004c63-8625-4469-8f17-1ce047729ddd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"bd7cd814-b3d2-4237-ab9e-09a78b047ff2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"49eb2206-3953-44b1-bfab-ec70ead82be5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4376,"FileName":"608da4b5-1896-4dbf-8b7b-e2d732dfbcf1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":480,"Name":"Final Zone","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are about to be transported 100 years into the future, where wars are no longer fought by missiles and nuclear bombs.

It takes place in Niceland, where Ralph, Felix, several Nicelanders and Q*Bert characters live.At the beginning of a game, Ralph climbs up a hotel, breaking windows as he goes. It is the player's job as Felix, to repair each window with his magical hammer, while avoiding bricks that fall off when Ralph punches, and Duck Hunt-inspired ducks that fly horizontally across the screen at random. On some screens, if the player waits long enough, a Nicelander will appear in a window to drop off a pie which Felix can collect for a period of invincibility and other effects depending on the version of the game. As the game progresses, the enemies become more numerous and faster, and there are more windows to repair. What's more, Ralph will smash and break windows that the player has already repaired, forcing them to go back and fix them. Higher levels introduce rather increasing numbers of randomly-placed obstacles such as purple flowerbeds which prevent Felix from jumping up or down between two windows. The versions made available online also feature open window shutters for blocking Felix horizontally, while the arcade version instead has a number of large piles of bricks fall between two windowsills and get stuck starting in the fifth round. Felix can jump over these brick piles to get across the row, but they will kill him if he steps into them or jumps into them from below. \n\nThe story of the game is that Ralph is destroying Niceland Apartments in retaliation for the Nicelanders bulldozing his hollow-stump home in the forest to build their apartment building and leaving him in the town dump. When Felix fixes every window on the screen, Ralph climbs higher and reveals more floors of broken windows. When Felix fixes the highest screen (with penthouse visible on the arcade version), a cutscene plays where the Nicelanders join Ralph and Felix on the roof and award Felix a medal (which floats down from behind a pair of parting clouds), a pie, and a kiss on the cheek. The Nicelanders then lift up Ralph and hurl him off the building into a mud puddle. Finally, Ralph comes back to try again in a new level.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzsmhnHtCKE","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Tobi Komi","Publisher":"Tobi Komi","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"cfaa2e27-bdc1-4871-bfea-3f08cd755855.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"a57f59c1-35da-4e6b-86cf-1e99ab545c5d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"aed0b451-45a8-46d0-9a62-0d3f42a914c6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"3ba7aa69-3059-43b2-882b-a38e142d4a67.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"1c2b3ffa-626a-486c-ac7a-bbf70c39c77f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"eb7a0653-9058-470a-b223-3edafb28cd5b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33332,"FileName":"efa346dd-4b95-4ef4-8ead-a5a514947514.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33662,"Name":"Flash Point","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Flash Point (フラッシュポイント) is an arcade puzzle game by Sega that is based on Tetris.

The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. The player controls Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle.\n\nUnlike most Japanese adventures, Fushigi no Umi no Nadia is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which the player physically navigates the character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities that should be used at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but the player has to use inventory items on several occasions in order to advance.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"fd1cc04b-ff0a-40b8-bf5e-40d3ae41560a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"9d9973ab-943f-4f70-9710-119eaede728a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"a8f2e371-2b06-473a-b66c-a57f169645eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"9ee56cb3-505f-4102-ac55-99fa472ff669.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"d0fc3045-de5e-4810-bdf5-55bc71018fb6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"2a78123a-c4b0-4ccb-adec-07514c6df93c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"5ce2e334-bbd3-4448-82b1-0a10ad778e08.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"9cf5c48c-69d4-438d-9264-f57541bf0a7d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"7f35ab22-aa9b-4f21-982a-f068be12267d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"ec9d1b59-3c85-4c10-8329-3054c8fdbda0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33949,"FileName":"b81cf956-df66-4d0c-a684-a1a085799f1e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33949,"AlternateName":"Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":172382,"Name":"FX Unit Yuki: The Henshin Engine","ReleaseYear":"2019","Overview":"Stop SG Corporation from hacking into the CJC video game!

However, years later, a dictator named Smash Daisaku kidnapped Gunstar Green and brainwashed him into telling him where the Mystical Gems were.

Hostages will give the player extra lives and ammo.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3llrSb4xwA","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"The Kremlin","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"b4aafdb7-1962-46ae-87bf-aa0dbd656386.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"9ba23c78-17ef-4151-b7e9-88b85dc8eb18.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"9b8403e6-da4c-432e-a196-61c3bb4fda29.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"7ef16e61-0816-44ec-87b4-ed915cb2b209.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"f193193d-b53c-40d5-bca2-161d2775f4ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"9812fd62-880c-496c-929b-500d280db368.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"9e031d2d-50c7-4d76-b106-d7de7bfbc25c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"363e77fc-f40d-4c1d-ab01-f0ae25151e34.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"37f9acc4-19f3-4974-b830-68dd139186c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"6a01318b-b6de-4793-ae74-303a29d941d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"9d05b86d-4895-40e8-bea2-4961dbc76935.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"6beafd02-f048-4796-b054-fd81e20f4249.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"bf33f229-b78a-4c56-9f77-cac070d2db4a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"2f09148d-4f92-4db3-a7f2-df289f654b8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"b8e243b1-c741-455d-aefd-e85d285dcf50.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"f035d4b9-a48c-4575-8ca2-ec01a3d9e543.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"33d92907-c2c5-4ae5-8161-ceada0ea1bfd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"47994129-7ea1-42e9-978a-bff0d5abbdee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"bce79a4c-fea8-4dba-be97-77e8109cc144.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"3990a68d-68ff-4b4e-b9eb-3fa9df02ba8b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"ff8b6adf-4cc9-483f-86b1-133babe11ff4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"149b719a-bcd4-4c00-ba1c-1af88b2f8dc8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"c3442188-f689-45d5-8e84-d02f361b823d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"610bb029-9a9b-40d7-8b1e-72d642056de2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"17805b30-5af1-481c-b366-82c32be4b411.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"fbcbb14a-8093-4599-a794-1ac1fd96718b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"7efe43f8-dac0-43fd-b7d9-fe47c5133b92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"0369feee-ede2-4f4d-8f47-0d619b3e87f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"8d38af8e-589f-42f3-a809-2e1283ab88db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"7db281fd-026a-4065-942e-784ff4e3fd02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"FileName":"7f277514-f7b3-4870-9229-41de813e918f.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4459,"AlternateName":"007 Shitou: The Duel","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"AlternateName":"007 Shitō","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"AlternateName":"James Bond 007: The Duel","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4459,"AlternateName":"James Bond 007: The Duel","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":4463,"Name":"James Pond 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Unlike the first game of the series, that was a mission-based game, and the second one, where your character had unique abilities such as observing the whole level and growing to unlimited height, \"James Pond 3\" is a standard jump and run platform game.

Development is presumed to have taken place around 1994/1995 - a Game Boy version saw a release in PAL territories in 1994, with a similar Super Nintendo version being released in early 1995. No versions of the game have ever been released outside of PAL regions.\n\nIt is entirely unrelated to another Super Nintendo game, Jelly Boy 2 which also wound up being cancelled - Jelly Boy 2 is actually a sequel to the Super Nintendo game Jerry Boy, known as Smart Ball outside of Japan.\n\nIt is unknown why Jelly Boy was cancelled. Review copies were sent to the gaming press and a fully playable prototype has since been dumped and released online.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F80kmUzwPIE","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Probe Software","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"b70142f0-251e-431f-b738-79baf9d787f1.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"02838133-7e7e-48ee-a0ce-2699c5646f9f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"b81750e5-04f7-484a-9d44-e8374a15a57f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"f37eca2f-d0a9-46ff-8494-f7180c93c482.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"ef04ea05-1480-49f1-89fb-c256e10c44b8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"7f87cdb5-508a-4c70-826f-cd6633d8d71b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"707644c7-f1d1-4cc0-9d03-80f8c63b43ae.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"66c238f1-1c32-4fdb-933e-c063a38032b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"7b20c5ab-d95a-4de8-aa4e-f2a572b751aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"a5216b9b-2e78-4130-a96f-ff8e61f6b464.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"7f789a5c-391b-4228-a6ab-83e27f8c12c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":29390,"FileName":"d8ddbbfb-eabf-4fe7-a12c-9431581d28bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134133,"Name":"Jennifer Capriati Tennis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This is a tennis game featuring the game modes Exhibition, Circuits, and Training.

Despite its name, there was not an arcade release of Jim Power - it is in fact a re-tooled version of the 1993 Super NES/IBM PC game, Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3D (which itself is an update to the earlier 1992 release Jim Power In Mutant Planet for home computers).\n\nThe Arcade Game was planned to be essentially the same game as Lost Dimension in 3D, however the stages utilizing the Super NES' \"Mode 7\" effects were replaced with simpler 2D shoot-'em-up stages. There have also been numerous tweaks to make the game easier, as Jim Power games are notoriously difficult.\n\nThe glaring omission from this Mega Drive port, and indeed most versions of the game, is the dropped support for anaglyph 3D glasses, allowing the Super NES version to obtain a pseudo-3D look (and hence gain the name \"Lost Dimension in 3D\"; a pair is even included in the SNES version's box). Advertising and media coverage suggests that the feature was planned to appear in the Mega Drive game in some form, but it is unknown whether any compatible builds were created.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYCRAim7dig","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Loriciels","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"597a3c7a-1098-4cd4-b8f8-fa7e43b3ee71.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"1eba4eff-9b68-4f58-a5a8-acd7c571e68a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"f0313a4f-e98c-41ff-a257-fe23addbfe02.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"68e4dd51-aaed-43ee-92ce-fecff63c1a57.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"b9096bfd-ec83-4637-9770-ba19a400aed8.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"ed4a4631-36c4-4395-a3d1-7c9f5e9488c4.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"8951c358-c2f3-4b94-a6f1-fcc7575c0158.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23292,"FileName":"b5dbd0a6-bdbc-4471-87ae-6f518fbcd2a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201999,"Name":"Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3D","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In in this altered and expanded port of the original Amiga title, Earth has always blocked \"The Lost Dimension\" and now its alien guardian, Vaprak, threatens to annihilate Earth to free its brethren in the dimension.

The objective of the game is simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega's Wonder Boy. The game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.\n\nThe original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes (much like Taito's Darius) at the end of a boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Eden Entertainment Software","Publisher":"Takara","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"08f940eb-126c-446c-9d8b-19f536c88c4c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"19f8d985-7c0c-41ee-920a-8162462f6db8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"dcc0beef-99d5-4394-bac8-f4e63bbcb74a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"1646572a-5f13-4b4f-bf25-d5fea3ff404e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"24ff080f-e5f0-4c63-b742-1270fcbbc089.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"18450c07-f80e-4386-9876-9c5147621a25.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"4c78ad09-f45b-4535-a47e-d7d0e0e4cedb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"a40704bd-9f5f-4f7e-a2eb-6e66fdfdfa29.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17156,"FileName":"0434b6b9-4730-48d1-9eed-a549c6c1b474.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":17156,"AlternateName":"Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":4468,"Name":"Joe Montana Football","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pass for the touchdown with Joe Montana, the man who drove his team to four Super Bowl triumphs.

When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua & The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.\nThough the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).\n\nGameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Education","Developer":"Wisdom Tree","Publisher":"Wisdom Tree","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":20359,"FileName":"722e906e-191d-404a-b64c-3a3206470197.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20359,"FileName":"22eeea28-64b4-49ed-9334-c9321275b830.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20359,"FileName":"74b21d3d-91c1-4a70-ae5f-0e655d05b840.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20359,"FileName":"4b3fa3fe-dc05-437f-b13a-9c40d4f044e6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20359,"FileName":"236517b1-e57d-4ec6-b815-a67b7b4d1e4b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2650,"Name":"Journey from Darkness: Strider Returns","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter.

Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Tiertex","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"9d463c34-fc26-4195-9f31-bd073693c153.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"c2164abc-b651-4cea-ab4b-0510443783df.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"ae8be543-75dc-4d73-a6aa-29b7c6172e8d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"c9d47504-6f44-42b9-a5b8-363d824a2ef4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"59a8d728-c4d7-45cb-8eeb-12d95ee6eece.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"a7455871-d09b-498c-bbd3-cff7e232fd5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"494e9f65-a79c-4088-96d2-9bb0df8943e5.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"f69de52f-57e6-4ec1-86d0-9c8b5d9f6838.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"b1ecc739-6200-4592-b439-20008fa833fc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"b86bca1d-4db3-4d8c-bd02-425db8ddce23.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"2fe2c4b8-071f-4e0f-a6c2-1f136a675781.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"9e5fc548-7cd2-4109-b566-044f8a5c5109.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"70ca6161-d34d-45a5-9f43-fc24f88fe6b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"1b5a087b-2413-4652-88d5-31eacfac6d04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"bbff1261-d7d9-491d-8c6b-dfce2931175c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"20ad7c4a-f51c-4d94-a690-599c3c3b9f93.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2650,"FileName":"50b560bb-3f84-406e-99ef-9e792b35c88d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":2650,"AlternateName":"Journey from Darkness: Strider Returns","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"AlternateName":"Strider Returns: Journey from Darkness","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2650,"AlternateName":"Strider II","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":4471,"Name":"Judge Dredd","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.

The player moves and fights in a traditional RPG style, but entering certain locations switches the game to a command-adventure style where the player can ask characters about different subjects, investigate items of interest, and collect and use a wide variety of items. At first the player controls only the recruit, but other characters later join the player's party.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"MA-BA","Publisher":"MA-BA","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20337,"FileName":"e26568be-ba0a-4877-9bb0-f6933f39f590.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20337,"FileName":"617af1e3-155c-4e78-957c-f1a96eaa0aea.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20337,"FileName":"fb74c4ac-3d2e-4053-be2f-b5016713b881.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20337,"FileName":"3920ad69-934c-4ccb-8082-68c9620bc895.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20337,"FileName":"8d64e7ab-3fbe-45a5-ae1a-9d1ec408f2d7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20337,"FileName":"32645298-c78e-415f-802e-b9f558545ba7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":20337,"AlternateName":"Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: 98-Shiki Kidou Seyo!","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20337,"AlternateName":"Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor: 98-Shiki Kidō seyo!","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":111628,"Name":"King of the Monsters","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Players get to choose any one of four monsters for battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together.

The unique cartridge featured \"Lock-On Technology\" and allowed players that also owned the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2 to link the two together and play the game through as Knuckles instead of Sonic. However, partly because of a poorly matching colour palette, no such feature was included in the first Sonic game (instead, attaching Sonic 1 to the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge unlocked the full version of Blue Sphere).\n\nIn the ROM hacking community, creating a patch that allowed the gamer to play as Knuckles in Sonic the Hedgehog was considered the \"Holy Grail of ROM Hacking.\" On September 1, 2005, Stealth created a hack that allowed a player to do just that. His hack was called Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog (Knuckles in Sonic 1, or S1K for short)\n\nKnuckles in Sonic 1 one gives Knuckles all the moves he has in Sonic and Knuckles, including gliding, wall climbing, and the spin dash. Not only that, Knuckles can transform into his Super form once he obtains all the emeralds (a cheat must first be enabled).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1zukeiy5PA&t=38s","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Stealth","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"4c508418-5071-4e54-bc4f-2f47bf9ec155.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"61617237-5904-4637-a7df-53f3c7a02acc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"8448b851-f432-48cd-8971-b59a24c39761.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"69136510-9a21-460f-91cc-c7f7c37ffb75.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"8f6e4a7e-e2ed-48cd-acc1-fa0dae1478b9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"823e1921-7ff2-4c3a-a827-a293a4963322.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"5089b1be-421f-48ba-a45d-fe144c00b846.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"7c183048-96c8-448e-a59e-dbacbd5eff08.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"a836ca25-b4b3-4ba0-8594-1234ce4cbfdd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":136069,"FileName":"bb2cc186-29ae-47ab-b335-69c8b8cf09a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":136069,"AlternateName":"Knuckles in Sonic 1","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":181037,"Name":"Kromasphere","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"CMD","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181037,"FileName":"093c38ec-c969-4add-bff0-0643f3a9c08a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4481,"Name":"Krusty's Super Fun House","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hey, kids!

It was developed by an unknown company likely connected to Chuanpu & Gamtec and published by X Boy.\nA second release does not credit X Boy but it is unknown if it was published by another company or by X Boy without their logo.\n\nIn this game, players get the choice of playing as either Simba or Mufasa, although they play identically to one another, through several levels, each with a boss at the end, all while having to contend with various platforming hazards such as floating platforms, swings and all sorts of enemies that obstruct their path.\nBoth lions possess the ability to attack with their claws using the B button and can fire a special attack, a energy wave that shoots straight forward, with the A button. Extra special attacks can be found throughout every level.\n\nHealth can be restored in game by picking up hearts and lives can be gained by picking up a 1-up. Atop of this, a life is earnt by picking up 100 Sun Emblems with the counter resetting afterwards. Throughout each level, progress can be saved by leaping at an unlit torch, which will light and act as a Checkpoint.\n\nThere is no story in-game and the ending screen is simply a shot of the player's lion gazing out across a lake as the word \"FIN\" appears overhead.\n\nTrivia\nStrangely enough, Simba's in-game sprite is coloured a pale pink. Atop of this, while his idle graphics are taken from The Lion King, every other sprite seems to be an original.\nOn the same note, Mufasa' sprite is simply Adult Simba's from the same game.\nEven more so then with Mulan, this game takes almost every resource from other games, such as enemies from Donkey Kong Country and the background on the Stage Screen screen is from the Transylvania stage in QuackShot.\nMost bizarrely of all, this game contains many sound samples taken from games like The Lion King and Disney's Aladdin often distorted immensely and employed in appropriate places. For example, a bug will sound like a monkey and the sound effect played when you pause the game is a portion of Mufasa's sound bite from The Lion King, slowed down incredibly and cut off.

It was last seen in a very early state at Winter CES 1995.\n\nIt is speculated that the game, primarily intended for the North American market, was not released because of Taito America's closure in 1995.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Neverland","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"b1f7fcdc-27ac-44a3-af7c-fff522ab0679.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"f9f0ae81-c6f7-4478-8f07-dfb9581caa7e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"3e2057af-bfef-4732-a448-4117ae744a67.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"1c2383fd-46c3-4147-8d9f-007b5f9382dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"ab04824f-e81c-4c34-a3fc-678075586501.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"4621e632-0824-4763-b386-b7f984f756c4.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"e35bfaef-0bbc-482c-813a-276b3cdfe232.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132589,"FileName":"1fae4dbf-679b-41b6-8b2c-9e3461eb337d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4488,"Name":"M-1 Abrams Battle Tank","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Take the most powerful NATO tank, the M-1 Abrams, in 8 difficult missions against the Warsaw Pact forces.

It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency.\n\nAmong the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player.\n\nThe game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \"classic\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win).

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.\n\nThe rights to the game were passed across a multitude of developers and publishers. In 1991 Electronic Arts had publishing rights, and produced a copy of the game for the Mega Drive in North America and Europe. While this version is complete, music porting and text drawing is somewhat sloppy, some of the graphics were recreated, colors were changed (most notably, the marble is now red), and the marble's motion restrictions were somewhat relaxed (allowing for jumps and drops not possible in other versions of the game).\n\nAtari Games' home console division Tengen produced their own Mega Drive copy for the Japanese market in 1993, which is different to the Electronic Arts version. This is similar to the situation regarding the Mega Drive port of Klax, in which Namco produced their own copy for Japan. This Japanese version, which appears to have been produced internally by Tengen of Japan, is much more faithful to the original game (but whether or not it is a direct port is unknown), and features trackball support through the Sega Mouse.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Electronic Arts","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"8f11b1ad-ad4d-4ea3-aa38-c1de71b17dfc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"c4a215a9-5a21-4df1-b3c2-cd957466d034.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"85d7c3d6-2579-406a-b530-f4fd066058ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"eb5448f2-c05f-42d8-b6a8-776692b0b5f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"241ac039-d639-4bb4-bd30-aae478f6114b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"260d19bc-46ee-4971-aaf9-ec092830a7fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"65476910-ec86-4739-923e-facf5c4e9f0f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"26c613f3-139a-466c-bc45-8bee003b5ea2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"8f36de7d-f706-4064-9ef4-439fe4dac562.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"74478085-df0a-4f1b-b1f7-2201e8386d28.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"c235346e-5ed0-4960-bff4-8b4e0adc30e2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"7be80e91-57fc-455d-b172-858ef0e575d9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"cf8573e5-3b8b-470d-9097-ded68d660d4f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"f26393ac-75f9-4ba5-9a16-fae3e6ee488f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"8618328f-8014-4ef1-826d-da9f742c192b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"c025e647-c18e-4546-b9ef-13e1b926c805.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"ac573f37-4a1f-4863-8736-9cb350dbc1d8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"b994f884-11fc-4c5a-aded-9e94943c3dda.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"cdf99fef-5a17-40c4-8590-069cc61d91ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"192475e8-9d2b-472a-9639-64a022d2f9b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"c1b0c298-11e2-4e7e-a6df-b7004082631e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"3acd99ad-f6b7-40f6-a538-2ff03f067a90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"49eee6fc-dcb9-4f8e-909e-4965f47a9d8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"55ab721a-fe4d-4cb9-bc3c-4a84670f3519.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"7b5a8862-78ad-4152-9c80-8d6ad5285b83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"e02e76ff-6917-4dda-a739-55abe86a3809.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4493,"FileName":"6f815f59-92cf-4e00-a5cf-8b568c8132da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4494,"Name":"Mario Andretti Racing","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most successful racing drivers in the US scene, and five of his relatives have also raced professionally.

At its center lies a mountain called \"Peace\", in which an amusement park known as \"Marvel Land\" resides. This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.\n\nA young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not, you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.\n\nYou kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones, which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food. The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them.\n\nDuring the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the \"clone\" attack. Hidden throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and enemies.\n\nThe last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from \"rock, paper, scissors\" through to the Musical Chairs variant.

Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks.

As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.\n\nThe game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a \"pin-up\" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"a43ee82c-327a-45cd-8a49-dd85c93bb56c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"4a84fdf5-d025-4af7-8f19-b16335b52c5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"317d556f-c3b3-43c5-876a-c9e2a736e35a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"d5301a40-c8f4-4955-a115-1fddac5ed900.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"75a5ce0c-99bb-4df7-a680-2b60fea3d666.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"7081b7ec-3d4e-4925-987d-70d4387d81a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33980,"FileName":"a52277d8-f0e3-4486-80f8-f29666576736.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4500,"Name":"Menacer 6-Game Cartridge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Menacer 6-Game Cartridge is a cartridge containing six light gun games for use with the Sega Menacer.

As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.\n\nMickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.\n\nEach task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Designer Software","Publisher":"Hi-Tech Expressions","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":4503,"FileName":"b99e684c-264a-419f-93a1-9f8748a885ac.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4503,"FileName":"649696b3-6ff0-4bb8-b3e3-ff4b12438ca4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4503,"FileName":"72858c04-f106-4964-8619-f879da7762f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4503,"FileName":"ed3a5089-a9b4-4e9f-81f6-32a3936207f7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4503,"FileName":"ab61bc6b-dd0b-4ded-b524-f528f5ea3012.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4503,"FileName":"f371ff56-2132-493f-beba-f8dddc7f0c03.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4504,"Name":"Micro Machines","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you.

You are the pilot of the Russian-built MiG-29 and you need to accomplish several strategic missions to ensure the success of the operation.\n\nAs this is a simulation game, the MiG-29's control panel is recreated (displaying altimeter, compass, thrust indicator, radar and more), and many actions are done manually by the player (such as controlling brakes and landing gear, performing take off and landing, etc.). There are a number of weapons and an automatic targeting system to help successfully accomplish the missions. The MiG-29 is also equipped with flares and chaff used to avoid enemy fire.\n\nThe game is divided into 5 missions plus a tutorial mission. Mission objectives include destroying the enemy's command control and communications systems, escorting a submarine to safety, and destroying enemy Scud missiles.

After the supplied MIDI keyboard was connected to a console or computer and the included software was loaded, a user followed the on-screen notes. Its marketed value was as a tool to teach users to play the piano. It provided hundreds of lessons, and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons. Due to its high price (US$500) and low sales, the keyboard with all of the original cables together are a rare find. Factory sealed copies of the Sega Genesis version can be worth up to US$412. Aside from being released in the United States, the Miracle Keyboard was also released in multiple regions within Europe. The European versions are, however, much harder to find. Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were also later converted for PC use - the Nintendo Seal of Quality on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic.\n\nWith the exception of the metronome that was used in the Miracle system's lessons, the Miracle system did not ever generate sounds through the video game console hardware; all MIDI information from the console was converted into audio by the instrument's built-in ROM and played through the instrument's stereo speakers, allowing the keyboard to be used independently of the console.\n\nStudents can learn to play classic piano, rock piano or show tunes. The Miracle system would use artificial intelligence to assess the player's ability before creating custom lessons. Fun exercises were meant to make learning the piano seem less like a chore and more like playing a video game. Instead of using the traditional NES controller, the piano became the controller as players aimed at targets in order to perfect their music skills.\n\nThere are multiple games that students can play to help teach musical skills. One game is called Robo Man where the player has to press the correct keys at the right time to create a bridge. If they miss, Robo Man falls and the player loses. Another game is a duck hunting game. The player has to press the keys that correspond to the positions of the ducks on a musical staff to shoot them. In the \"Ripchord\" game, players must press the correct combination of keys for a chord to land paratroopers onto a target.\n\nComputer Gaming World liked the Miracle system's games and graphics, describing them as \"not only entertaining and challenging, but they are also cleverly designed to reinforce the lessons\". The magazine concluded, \"everything that Software Toolworks promises about this system is true [but] there is still no substitute for parental involvement\". David Wesley and Gloria Barczak mentioned that the system was praised by educators and that in 1990 it was the highest-rated third-party NES title by Nintendo's software review team. At the same time, the Miracle system failed commercially with its expensive price and in comparison to later music-related titles such as Guitar Hero. It was not well-suited to average gamers who lacked musical experience or who were not highly committed and dedicated to undertaking long-term electronic piano learning. PC Magazine mentioned the system as being easy to use and likely more patient than a live piano teacher though the system did not cover certain aspects of piano playing such as hand position.\n\nNPR personality Noah Adams begins his 1997 memoir Piano Lessons attempting to teach himself how to play through the use of Miracle for PC software, ultimately finding greater success by taking more traditional lessons.\n\nAround 1995, technology from the Miracle system was incorporated into the Piano Discovery System, an interactive PC software title that worked with a MIDI keyboard and which was published by Jump! Music. By 1997, the Miracle product had been discontinued in favor of the Piano Discovery System, the latter of which could be used with the original Miracle Piano MIDI keyboard.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Music; Education","Developer":"The Software Toolworks","Publisher":"The Software Toolworks","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"ee4252de-687e-4a27-b608-c13e2e8328e9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"2df1b7ac-e7bc-4fe9-8fe5-b4def55403c2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"9449e4d1-1a40-428d-b831-f0209cd4f025.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"841836b7-dff6-491f-ab91-ac4ff48543c3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"0fd0c721-2dc6-489d-beb4-752c1847850d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"b7da8aef-82e5-4d22-9d2a-bcb72f77eb80.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"13bb597d-c4c1-4363-8373-8704e737fa10.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"fc92d0a5-e961-4a17-b51e-a2ab31b96327.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164726,"FileName":"8fbcdf27-8b1e-46ac-b279-1e70554aa183.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":178090,"Name":"Misplaced","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Misplaced is a homebrew puzzle game. The player directly controls the character Hara who wakes up on a small island floating in the clouds. This happens every day. Every level is a puzzle where a yellow key needs to be located. To reveal the key one or more red jewels need to be picked up and taken to a white square. Gradually different types of puzzle mechanics are introduced, often by a character called Hatter in the environment.\n\nEach level consists of a single, fixed screen. There are enemies such as ghosts present that need to be avoided. The main puzzle mechanic is the ability to stop time, record movement and then play back that movement at a different location. For instance Hara can stop time, move three steps down, three step left and three steps up. By recording and then launching this movement pattern at a different location, it becomes possible to move past a wall by walking on the air. This mechanic can be used as often as possible, but only one pattern can be stored and the amount of moves per pattern is limited.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"RetroSouls","Publisher":"RetroSouls","ReleaseDate":"2019-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178090,"FileName":"c2b6307f-51a1-46ce-bc61-6f5cc974c93d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":178090,"FileName":"3bd6f1dc-cdcd-4322-8fe5-550390ba211f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156867,"Name":"MK5: Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"MK5: Mortal Combat Mythologies - Sub Zero is a pirated port of Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero for PlayStation and Nintendo 64, made for the Mega Drive and SNES by DVS Electronic.\n\nThis game uses the system of Mortal Kombat Mythologies in that it's a cross between fighting and side-scrolling. The controls are somewhat awkward; during fights, Sub-Zero won't automatically turn around when behind an opponent, forcing the player to use the A button to turn around. The fighting engine isn't taken from the official Mortal Kombat games and instead uses an engine similar to one used in some other pirated Mega Drive fighting games. All of the opponents in this game are clones of major Mortal Kombat characters. There are four levels, each with a different set of clones to fight.\n\nThe graphics are taken from various Mortal Kombat games. Sub-Zero's sprites are taken from Mortal Kombat 2 while everyone else appears to be taken from Mortal Kombat 3. The music of the Mega Drive version uses different arrangements of the music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan, also present in the bootlegs Pocket Monster (Mega Drive version), The King of Fighters '99, and Mulan. The music of the SNES version uses soundtrack based on the PSX video game Soul Blade with arrangement also used in the SNES bootleg of the same name, and as happens with the Soul Blade bootleg, there are some sound effects taken from Super Buster Bros. The sound effects are taken from Mortal Kombat games, and Sonya and Sindel uses the male characters' sound effects.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_oagR78Cc0","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting; Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"DVS Electronic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"f6463c5d-513c-48c9-9fd2-84af36b4ffc7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"1aa44152-8e01-43ef-9b71-8913088192fd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"601c0fb6-e6e2-48b0-8cc3-2915265f4feb.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"327bf0ec-e9fb-461a-85ac-5761304d54f1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"2e9cade7-7de3-4087-ad5a-56ce8818fe93.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"37bb197b-d26e-46b9-9a56-dc6431a214fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"b1efa5d8-72c2-4d8c-a33c-4e607b8a7d4b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"ebb4516f-3991-4627-a9b0-0998a28d7582.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"e56d9b0f-5199-4841-b3c9-a691fc675600.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"cdc91855-da92-43ba-bf5d-5cf7cb89c8b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"7931497f-d627-41e1-893b-e0a68cee5e0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"FileName":"38eefd05-3ec7-4000-8f7c-ef75c3e8d3b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156867,"AlternateName":"MK5: Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"AlternateName":"Mortal Kombat 5: Sub-Zero","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"AlternateName":"Mortal Combat: Sub-Zero","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":156867,"AlternateName":"MK 5: Mortal Combat: SubZero","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":2582,"Name":"MLBPA Baseball","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Crush one outta the yard!

He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.\nWhen Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.\nShao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.\nMortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8KVAoZiZ2o","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Midway","Publisher":"Williams Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"5817b858-782f-4dd4-9a74-a08d8bfa401f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"a11e9c10-3376-4bcd-894c-ccc6df792827.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"cd009a60-08f0-41fe-8e02-1489688613cc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"935ee794-3ac0-4e2e-8a1a-08a6b5655aef.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"30b46ae9-a172-467e-bcc2-7720eeda22d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"ad191bef-3403-4e1f-9722-b4d3a829dfed.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"4229e207-dea1-4769-a1c7-790dfcf41d84.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"71ffffa3-c976-44f7-b4bd-b427592d862f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"a26f86b3-97aa-4f20-9e42-847a8f6cd182.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"d6d15363-b1e4-4466-8e9f-211c3809dc63.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"68989c3e-b5d7-42cc-bbd1-a1833ea30c40.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"fd818840-a731-4f4f-aa02-46fb27747c65.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"645d55b3-e145-4270-b5fa-79828aae56a4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"5798573e-3a08-4f6e-ac25-7cbfdddbe6bc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"8bd5f9e3-4bb4-472c-ab67-7b6aa148f838.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"adc29e67-74b8-4330-a885-433c16b64b8c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"b6ec708a-cc0d-4ce9-aa32-a5b0a506515f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"4017a73a-8eec-43fd-bc12-01c1a5ab83bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"913d02f1-af5d-43ce-a394-35228c09bd65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"4abf697b-964b-4e69-ab97-a3e213edb210.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"ead8e061-e7d3-40fb-ae29-1769d884abf5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"3ad8a0c7-9993-4170-90a1-7543d8950251.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"f80cf345-0fde-4a65-838a-4c28330c6339.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"FileName":"88055529-168e-4f00-b267-2dc939b4021e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":651,"AlternateName":"Mortal Kombat 3","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":651,"AlternateName":"Mortal Kombat 3","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":651,"AlternateName":"Mortal Kombat III","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":642,"Name":"Mortal Kombat II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following his failure to defeat to Liu Kang in the first Mortal Kombat game, the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung begs his master, Shao Kahn, to spare his life.

The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtIUtAOpt0","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Iguana Entertainment","Publisher":"Arena Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"ed05d565-d66a-4f8e-a6ed-d972221cb77c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"69430bd3-6ff5-45cf-9c25-f8afcb1a8996.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"04de2984-44e9-4097-bef3-47c93428cbb3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"d8a327b3-2fd3-4785-b672-ceac3e926fa6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"54942cbd-f73b-4b07-9d07-90207cf2f406.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"ae7fb279-1448-4b40-ae7e-34716959b44f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"cb022769-c3f1-48a5-a81d-94d2c4e1f43d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"e2c43511-7dd2-4137-bd93-9cd90e942b9f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"0e038307-bafc-49a7-95db-fdb186e1f272.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"9e86c385-7496-4ce1-afff-ab524d01f867.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"fca46828-fa71-4184-b324-22e1ce94b13f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"d2344a1f-6c79-4bfd-920d-4d4b056ea239.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"08484ace-400c-484d-9903-bd2f1e9ebd84.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"f20a3006-9c1a-40de-96de-4f67bf34d7b6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"f21d5a88-3ee1-488e-bb1e-902a0cc37911.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"9fb035ab-0830-440a-b868-e69c696c4869.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":657,"FileName":"8a11ddbb-beee-46d9-82f4-d76bc1436d2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":656,"Name":"NBA Jam: Tournament Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.\n\nUp to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.\n\nThe Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:\n\n    \"Hot Spots\" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.\n\n    Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant \"on-fire,\" enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.\n\n    \"Juice Mode\" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.\n\n    \"Tournament Mode\" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxK9lA-pxhI","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Iguana Entertainment","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"a06e486a-2fb9-4987-b929-76272c3571b4.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"edd5f8ee-1fe4-40e2-8f25-7f2212b58286.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"85cc0a60-f539-4460-93c4-e69c79f562b0.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"ce0ac6c7-0037-470f-88b1-f423f7f13272.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"6a1cda18-8873-4422-8f7d-2d18b58588ee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"e778b199-4614-40d3-b1b3-35559362fbb4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"f9339908-5b83-4b00-9ebf-cd2afeda43e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"0f7dfb28-91f5-4f23-96a7-bbbf0199f97a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"11c2a351-c6b3-4f93-b801-34574b8e52a4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"6ae2a9d6-4722-4c6d-8d8c-1e2067787d8f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"39ab8511-8770-4792-bd72-f0738498c34f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"1cfc91cc-0916-451c-885a-e4e7dab02ce2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"e7fd15e9-b961-4427-8696-b518e954f879.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"e54614d2-abfa-4cc8-a3f7-6cae9b1aa9f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"8efd9972-fa7d-4628-99ed-802692e6d666.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"4b039fc2-b185-4ebe-9313-6dcee52ae675.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":656,"FileName":"45c77e5a-f6f2-4916-abb2-653589eeaba1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176273,"Name":"NBA Live 19: Hardwood Classics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hack to update NBA Live 96 with updated NBA 2018-2019 rosters.\n\nRev D is the “Post-NBA Trade Deadline Updates (as of 02/28/2019)”, so it contains these latest changes:\n\nFor the full list of changes, please see the README.txt file in the download.\n• Enes Kanter signing to POR\n• Markieff Morris signing to OKC\n• Jeremy Lin signing to TOR\n• Corey Brewer signing to SAC\n• Wayne Ellington signing to DET\n• Nik Stauskis signing to CLE\n• Harless back in as starting SF for POR\n• NOTE: Pau Gasol signing to MIL (since his SAS buyout was announced around this time)","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2019-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":176273,"FileName":"59433830-298b-457c-abb0-4d624975834b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176273,"FileName":"8eb16c5c-2294-45b4-8ef2-a4d55f417887.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176273,"FileName":"d1035b0c-dcf5-473f-98c9-d785c5d38f7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176273,"FileName":"4c1a2166-83ab-4e74-9b1f-1449ba74bb49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176273,"FileName":"b3708315-028c-4e39-b2a5-64aa3bb8979e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176273,"FileName":"5ef65ed3-a7a0-4aea-8c9d-6ae8fa862d6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4518,"Name":"NBA Live 95","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Open up the court and see what basketball's really like!

The objective is to not let the blocks overflow, let Pac-Man eat the ghosts, and make lines to shorten the amount of blocks on the board. When Pac-Man eats a ghost, the Fairy Meter goes up. Once full, a fairy will eventually be dropped. Once the fairy comes to a stop by landing on anything, it waves its wand and every ghost in the eight lines below it will disappear, often resulting in numerous lines being completed and simplifying the board. Once the fairy disappears, the score bonus is given, and gameplay continues.\n\nPac-Attack can also be played in 2-player mode. Player 1 must eat Blinky, while Player 2 must eat Sue, the purple ghost from Pac-Mania. As players eat ghosts and complete lines, they will drop ghosts on their opponent's board, messing up their board and bringing them closer to the top. This game can even be played in puzzle mode. The object of this mode is to smash all 100 stages. If you get a Game Over, all the regular blocks appear with red crosses on them, while Blinky and Sue over backwards laughing silently.

The SNES version is credited to DVS Electronic Co., while the Mega Drive iteration seems to be developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu and published by X Boy. The game appears to have been released in 2000, as hinted by details on the box art.\n\nLike the Famicom pirate, the player controls Pikachu through numerous sidescrolling levels. There are 5 levels in total, with a boss at the end of each, as well a mini-boss in the first level of the Mega Drive version. Pikachu can jump on enemies and use a special move which clears all of the enemies on the screen, although the latter can only be done when the charge meter is full (indicated by a power bar at the top of the screen of the SNES version, or a numeric counter in the Mega Drive version, which is full when it hits 20.) The player can start either 3 and 5 lives and continues each, and there's a difficulty setting in the options menu. A sequel to this game was made for the Mega Drive, Pocket Monster II. The ending is an image of some Pikachus.\nThe graphics are ripped from numerous sources. The backgrounds are ripped from numerous Mega Drive games, including Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure, Mr. Nutz, Quackshot, Magical Taruruuto-kun and Monster World IV. The graphics from the latter aren't present in the SNES version. The level graphics of the fourth and the last stage of the SNES version was ripped from Skyblazer. Some of the enemy sprites are ripped from Syd of Valis, and one of the enemy sprites appears to be taken from Super Metroid. The intro, as well as several other graphics are taken from the Pokémon anime.\n\nThe music in the Mega Drive version seems to be mostly original, although the opening theme is based on the Goten vs. Trunks theme of Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (also used in the bootleg Dragon Ball: Final Bout), and there is music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan (2nd stage, bosses and last stage, also used in Mortal Combat 5) and Hercules 2 (3rd stage). Strangely, in the Mega Drive version, Pikachu constantly says his name on the title screen, when hit and upon losing a life while he's mute in the SNES game. This is probably because the SNES version's audio is an unedited rip from the game Bonkers and it might've been too difficult to do digitized audio on the system.\n\nDifferences Between Mega Drive/Genesis And SNES Versions \nThe Mega Drive version doesn't credit any company to making it, while the SNES version claims to be made by DVS Electronic Co.\nThe music is completely different in both games, with the Mega Drive version having a mix of original music and music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan and Hercules 2, while the SNES version takes the music from Bonkers.\nThe sound effects are also different in the two games, although with both they're in PCM format. One of them in the Mega Drive version is taken from Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.\nThe \"Pikachu\" sound effect isn't present in the SNES version, but is replaced with a \"Yow!\" sound clip from Bonkers.\nThere are numerous minor graphical differences between the two versions.\nThe Mega Drive version is set to Normal difficulty by default, while the SNES version is set to Easy.\nThe mini-boss in the first level isn't in the SNES version.\nMany of the bosses in the SNES version are smaller and follow a set movement pattern.\nThe fourth and fifth levels are completely different, aside from boss of level four.\nIn the ending, the background scrolls in the Mega Drive version while there's an ending message in the SNES version.\nIn the Mega Drive version, Pikachu can jump in mid-air before he falls down after touching an enemy. This is also present in Pocket Monster II.\nIn the Mega Drive version, you fight Onix as the final boss. In the SNES version, you fight recolors of the previous bosses with A.I. differences.\nThe boxart of the Mega Drive version features a picture of Pikachu traced from the cover of a Japan-exclusive N64 title Hey You, Pikachu! as well as several logos such as \"New Game\" and \"2000\", all covering the cover art of another N64 exclusive, Pokemon Stadium 2, as well as the original Nintendo and N64 logos. One half of the game's logo also comes from Hey You, Pikachu!, making its' title half-Chinese and half-Japanese; in its' entirety, it reads as 皮卡丘 げんきでちゅう (Píkǎqiū Gen Ki De Chu).\n\nTrivia \nThe box of the SNES version from DVS Electronic uses the same image of Pikachu and the smaller \"Pocket Monsters\" logo also found on the Pocket Monster Go! Go variation of Monster Go! Go! Go!!.\nThis bootleg became somewhat popular due to a JonTron YouTube video.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Chuanpu Technology","Publisher":"X-Boy","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":141475,"FileName":"20ee9b52-bf5f-45d9-95ec-3403a0280280.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141475,"FileName":"2aa18a23-df2a-48eb-9e83-5279f4a2d7f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141475,"FileName":"fa6064fd-a4b6-4bfd-9ba9-2ebe32b7c1fe.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141475,"FileName":"f73a2f12-ae49-4503-bf84-c4d40ba336f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141475,"FileName":"17c3f229-565c-4af8-8d77-892581fb3657.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":141495,"Name":"Pocket Monsters II","ReleaseYear":"2001","Overview":"Pocket Monsters 2, also titled Pocket Monster II and Pikaqiu II (皮卡丘II), is an assumed sequel to Pocket Monster, and is an unlicensed game for the Sega Mega Drive.

There are two main modes: Arcade and Practice, as well as a controller testing mode and an option mode. There are six songs (Dangerous, Think You, Relight, Bicycle, Reflect, and Clap), three difficulty settings (Easy, Normal, and Crazy), and eight settings for the drum pad's timbre (Classic, Cha Ka, Cyber, Pop 1, Pop 2, Soul, Big Band, and 2010 Music).\n\nIn-game, notes scroll up on the right, and the player must hit the button that corresponds with the note shown when it matches with the symbol for the note. A player is given points for every note matched (100 for Perfect, 30 for Great, 10 for Poor, and 0 for Miss). At the end, a results screen comes up, showing how many of each note you got in each category, multiplied by their value and added up, except for Miss, which is multiplied by 10, and is subtracted from the total, and shows if you have passed or failed.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6693X6W3TSo","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Music","Developer":"Tomsoft","Publisher":"Tomsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172158,"FileName":"652f6958-91db-4d3d-95e4-ed9c945e1ed3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172158,"FileName":"a5dc35eb-0f38-4efb-b557-ba0ff13e45a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":172158,"AlternateName":"Pokémon Crazy Drummer","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":156868,"Name":"Pokemon Stadium","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pokémon Stadium is an unlicensed game loosely based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name, made for the Sega Genesis & SNES by an unknown developer.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version of Pokémon Stadium, while having some aesthetic improvements and access to Pokémon unavailable in the SNES version, seems to be more broken than its SNES counterpart.

These creatures have otherworldly or supernatural abilities. The Primal Rage trading cards that were distributed along with the toyline presented each creature as a god of an aspect of nature, as in life and death, fire and ice. There are four of the good Virtuous Gods and three evil Destructive Gods. The character Sauron, God of Hunger, is marked as a \"Virtuous Beast\" despite the fact that his in-game ending displays an image of him devouring humans.

Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.\n\nThe majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZKsQ09qOk4","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Zyrinx","Publisher":"Time Warner Interactive Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"6e831077-e51c-466d-99df-ada1a45b9247.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"72486396-d9fa-4b3e-a644-422f91314465.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"9e2d5e8f-ce22-46a7-aba2-e60dad56e271.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"1047b900-0f9f-470e-8841-5b1ddf263f96.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"fd654541-a8fa-425c-a0f2-e394ba82a553.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"f12a548e-29b9-4cb0-a878-824b9e8c749f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"df43424b-1c5e-4ce7-a199-da0a3d347c49.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"dd02252b-082a-452e-b934-7f3deeaa2100.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"4a5561f6-2c4f-4da8-8968-dcbf55e5d9b2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"1677eeea-d25a-429b-9a21-0474618d65e5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"1381e845-549f-455b-bdb5-de0ac6f68033.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4593,"FileName":"156ebbf5-55db-437d-a93c-ed4397ecb904.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4593,"AlternateName":"Red Zone","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"AlternateName":"Red Zone","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4593,"AlternateName":"Hardwired","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":20348,"Name":"Rent a Hero","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tarō Yamada is an average young man who lives in the suburbs with his parents, until one day a strange package containing a superhero costume is delivered to his house by mistake.

The controls consist of 3 buttons for punches and 3 buttons for kicks (one for each in the Game Gear version), and jumping, moving, crouching and blocking are performed with the directional pad. The Cyborg has two super moves, the Turbo Head Butt and the Shoulder Barge. The player can choose the difficulty, number of rounds and time limit for the fights, as well as turn turn the super moves off.\n\nThe game has three modes: mission, where the player fights each robot in a fixed order; training, where the player can fight any robot in any desired order; and two players versus mode (absent in the Game Gear version), where the second player chooses any of the enemy robots to fight with. It features an AI system that reacts to the player style, 3D rendered cutscenes and the title song was composed by Queen's guitarist Brian May.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Data Design Interactive","Publisher":"Acclaim Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"ef1ab7a8-3965-432b-9e70-81292cd867d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"a4d2edb5-0588-4f1b-8720-03e38e890446.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"75c84f18-0e10-4706-b309-2d176443694d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"6c44cb69-8453-407a-9f2b-cc9eb3d4c1fe.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"23ba9598-5828-4a10-bbb0-534c9d9043fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"33e7c1bb-859d-4819-94c9-4639e7b7b4d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34076,"FileName":"8a6296a8-3289-43bd-ba0c-c68424a396bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":683,"Name":"Risk: Parker Brothers' World Conquest Game","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You're the General, so defend your countries, capture new territories, occupy vast continents... and keep building your armies so you can conquer the world!\n\n- Fast Setup: Touch one button and the computer deploys your troops.\n- Computer Intelligence: Battle your friends or the A.I. of 6 computer enemies.\n- Fast Play: Pick the classic attack or a computer fight to the finish.\n- Arcade Competition: Where your skill determines the outcome of the attack!\n- Battlefield Sound Effects and Music: Bringing the battlefield to life!","MaxPlayers":"6","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Sculptured Software","Publisher":"Ballistic","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":683,"FileName":"8a92caed-246f-47de-9b7d-d2e15ef6ffd1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":683,"FileName":"381242b5-dc5a-4c3a-bf99-b75bdaae3b4c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":683,"FileName":"0c27e2da-3f18-4c4b-9823-57b89ad2731d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":683,"FileName":"f4e80bd1-4415-447e-bff5-9e0bb4c0bdc4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":683,"FileName":"6f895aa3-fe16-4724-8d03-e789fd485036.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":683,"AlternateName":"Risk: Parker Brothers' World Conquest Game","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":683,"AlternateName":"Risk: The World Conquest Game","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":28077,"Name":"Risky Woods","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The ancient monks, who preserve the wisdom of the Lost Lands, have been frozen in stone.

The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Dinamic Software","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"1744e93c-ed9e-4d94-b5f8-3c6df438ae24.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"fd75fb07-971f-44e1-a3e6-859dc10968ce.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"aa53e43a-b444-46ec-a277-8aba1a6a92e2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"5964b0fa-57f3-4f7c-8917-963b424f61fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"e802e6c5-47c0-4467-ae7a-0fdebe9f53bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"d342f532-2883-4fa9-99b5-81ec4aa89654.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"ee0763c5-020a-43e5-a304-f680ac8daa7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"afb35172-821a-4900-8fb4-17baaf0b1521.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"ae0e7601-7d2e-41be-8dab-f13090bbe023.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"8261d470-af78-41a9-b3b1-9bc433d3cc38.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"69d11f04-a318-4d2f-a9e6-1d840e08f1fa.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"be9dc72f-d8c7-48a7-af4a-a41c534f9676.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"3f1814b6-6bf1-411c-bd28-0448c9af397b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"bea029f2-9ba3-4212-a79f-eac3094cb151.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"467ace46-72ae-47c5-9886-5331a8a307c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"11361d77-92f6-4de8-aa6b-194b253e343d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"e98f1972-46ce-41ef-8adb-33908fce332d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":28077,"FileName":"a96e0c4d-2e7f-4e9a-a294-4e739a039480.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":28077,"AlternateName":"Risky Woods","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"AlternateName":"Jashin Draxos","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28077,"AlternateName":"Risky Woods","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":2269,"Name":"Ristar","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Ristar, we follow the story of a far away solar system, Valdi, that was corrupted by an evil tyrant called Greedy.

Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.\n\nThe vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up & down and change orientation between facing left and facing right\nStinger: A prototype \"next generation\" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.\nSea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill\nSea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport\nRemote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches\nDarwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach.

The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks. There are no sub-quests - the secrets in the game involve the location and use of special metal for forging esoteric items.

Each question has 4 alternative answers, of which just one is right. The player wins a money prize for each right question. If he decides to stop at a certain question, he wins half of the questions' prize. If he guesses wrong, wins a quarter of the prize.

In two-player mode each player chooses a character and plays co-operatively, but in one-player games the player also chooses a character for the computer to control, with its artificial intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on enemies away from the ones occupying the player-controlled character.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"The Bitmap Brothers","Publisher":"Spectrum Holobyte","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"a1e22495-93e0-4480-97fa-48ad3c8d433b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"f9371977-8241-40e4-9450-4fb3eb01133f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"a4eeae82-1027-4364-bd74-c2257574b6bb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"1b38e7fb-87e9-44de-adaf-23a1799f4ab9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"2144bf34-7763-44b0-a49a-e597482827a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"e9638ce8-086f-49ad-bf93-746c863a0de4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"4c76c956-3f2a-4641-8ca8-15f599896d45.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"77985e31-50e7-461b-afeb-1f094235daf6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"28e3076b-22bf-437f-88bb-8ac105555297.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"3f3f14ff-afff-4968-bf22-7341b96de97c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"2e13cddd-858b-4a0e-b073-714cf3452314.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"8596a492-01d7-4556-81c4-f2589f6fd714.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"220b4585-dd40-4d3c-8a4f-35c41088807c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"55e7f5d9-3f4f-4106-9b7d-b54ef50e61f8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"2193443b-118f-4622-b8e5-0293f273bb5d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"d187e99b-4c67-453f-8b5b-ecd75c02f13d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4622,"FileName":"2f278f07-900c-4d68-9845-827a1fe69922.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4622,"AlternateName":"The Chaos Engine","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4622,"AlternateName":"Soldiers of Fortune","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":130396,"Name":"Soldiers of Fortune 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The sequel to The Chaos Engine (known as Soldiers of Fortune in North America).

Knuckles is playable in the Sonic 3 levels and Tails becomes available in the Sonic & Knuckles levels. Also, all of the levels from both games are accessible, starting from Sonic 3. Once these levels are completed the Death Egg falls off screen intact instead of being destroyed, and then the play continues straight to the levels of Sonic & Knuckles. The final boss of Sonic 3 is also omitted for Sonic and Tails.\n\nAfter collecting all the Chaos Emeralds of Sonic 3 a new quest becomes available when entering the first special Stage in Mushroom Hill Zone which allows you to collect seven new Emeralds called \"Super Emeralds\". When these Emeralds are collected, Hidden Palace Zone will become available, and Sonic can transform into Hyper Sonic and Knuckles can transform into Hyper Knuckles. Tails has no Hyper form, but the Super Emeralds are needed for him to transform into Super Tails, as the Chaos Emeralds alone have no effect on him.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL9rAVYFdJU","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"97329766-3ef0-4181-b2c6-cca040f3cdd4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"d403ff67-802f-44b1-8c83-9d3384fff0e6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"4eee3e38-ce20-4fa9-9af9-1fddaf927bdd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"51fdf9c3-54d1-494b-a4eb-60e76b88515d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"3e62424f-73e0-4dd5-89a9-504036355c5e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"963b0e05-b8a7-435d-bce3-d2644d52218c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"845b4ba7-bcf5-4662-a8eb-48d86c794a7b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"bb7ebe1f-20c5-43af-bef7-7d93cfb7c324.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"3058c47c-a6dd-46d0-a4bc-b55f0a82d846.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"98ecab4b-771a-4704-be48-8ac8766f3880.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"0829cd49-edf5-498f-bdd0-eb4a36bea943.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"a5d01762-5dd8-47ac-8f83-7af1b4d72c5a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"dcc9d6ac-ce47-459b-8ff9-dd4b52a3c681.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"430066d5-8d6d-4e3a-b81f-b1baf3ac0c77.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"c824d439-afbc-4665-851d-ea96f0b859e5.PNG","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"df14c042-7436-43bd-9734-f553379b4e87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"f88c157f-fd00-4c58-949a-5d2f884dbd59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"b4ccd0a1-5753-4667-8b80-320165a63c05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"32d926db-837d-4984-bfc2-ba623afdda9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"3387465f-3298-4935-a85d-df5793963a02.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"5e9c2c73-d3c8-4dbe-be68-5617925554f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"FileName":"686bd167-c144-4479-ab35-e0571138fa6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":14066,"AlternateName":"Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic The Hedgehog 3","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"AlternateName":"Sonic & Knuckles + Sonic 3","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"AlternateName":"Knuckles in Sonic 3","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14066,"AlternateName":"Sonic The Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183488,"Name":"Sonic 1 Gaslight","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"One of the early hacks of Sonic the Hedgehog from Esrael.

Even Casino Night, which received a makeover since its beta state, has been restored to its former (very pink) look. The only zone that is incomplete in this hack is Genocide City, which is merely Chemical Plant with a different background and palette. Enemies from early revisions have also been restored\n\nIn addition to restoring cut zones, the hack adds a few new features: The ring counter now shows how many rings remain in a zone, the level select menu has been updated to allow access to the new zones, some Sonic 3 graphics have been ported, and even Knuckles has been ported from Sonic & Knuckles!\n\nThis is one of those hacks that simply must be played, its only flaws are the somewhat amateur-feeling level designs for the new zones and the fact it does not work on the real Genesis hardware.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Esrael","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2015-04-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":176419,"FileName":"c80ea879-6c0f-438e-9f22-b2e140c27ac7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176419,"FileName":"418754d8-7fb5-4980-bfc7-ffbba290e3ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176419,"FileName":"9b45d84d-c62c-433a-953b-5093e13919a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176419,"FileName":"d72a3b79-9f75-4f93-8fbc-c34052da68e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176419,"FileName":"32bda56a-6a60-4d6f-908c-51989e7f2f11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2284,"Name":"Sonic 3D Blast","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Doctor Robotnik discovered that some strange birds, called Flickies, live on an island in an alternate dimension.

The hack is named due to the ability to control a team of characters, which is reminiscent of the more recent 3D game, Sonic Heroes.\n\nThe hack is built on Sonic 2’s engine, which has been enhanced by both flamewing and ColinC10 to have new features. These include: multiple gameplay elements from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, such as element shields and character-specific abilities; the ability to save progress, scores, etc. to SRAM (something rarely implemented in Sonic 2, with the other notable example being Esrael’s Sonic 2 Delta); various bug-fixes and improvements to the mechanics of the original games; and many more features, both implemented and planned.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy381_-EmwE","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sonic Retro","ReleaseDate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"cdce6983-50fb-432c-a1ee-12023c23e2dc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"44aa04cf-3112-4331-bf41-da2255bf6283.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"78e71515-1d67-45c7-84bd-1301a002bfe3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"4e4678cd-2605-4cd0-986a-b08ea800d9e4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"9b24df9f-075c-432a-acc7-96cc4967a6d1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"ceaefb29-430c-40e6-ac3a-da9b9bfe3b07.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"a48f3a6c-e0ce-4a77-8cfe-91d3595e865b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"f5858834-7984-47cd-a760-a137f8c7cebc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"25e1195b-005a-4f4a-b50d-af1d8c2e6ad9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129086,"FileName":"a1e6b23b-f244-4999-a187-707b97ac97ff.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":129086,"AlternateName":"Sonic Heroes ","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":129086,"AlternateName":"~Hack~ Sonic the Hedgehog Classic Heroes","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":180493,"Name":"Sonic Classic Heroes 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Flamewing","Publisher":"flamewing","ReleaseDate":"2011-09-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":180493,"FileName":"24d280de-920b-4384-bd30-23eabf5519cd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180493,"FileName":"4122a959-e2b8-4822-946e-fada77667d70.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180493,"FileName":"688f6c88-37c2-4d0e-baa2-0cfe5b25fc41.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180493,"FileName":"4c6b588e-5ec4-46e6-8d19-778f67f20f47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180493,"FileName":"0409c819-8e8c-4b0b-817c-fe53aa437c99.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":180493,"FileName":"7dfa695a-0c02-40ca-ac17-b875d87a4dc8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":180493,"AlternateName":"Sonic 2 Heroes","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":4624,"Name":"Sonic Classics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sonic Classics compiles three games from the Sonic The Hedgehog series onto one cartridge.

Also, Sonic can pick up Tails and throw him upwards, to make it easier to reach higher platforms. The stages and music are also similar to those in Chaotix. There are no sound effects at all during gameplay. There are no badniks to be found, however there are spikes, and you lose rings when hitting them (even though you have none).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnuZOFmVFQQ","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"59e8b448-be3b-4168-8fa9-4c8f4f6048ea.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"185e9d00-458a-4f30-8e57-75bd5147b9a1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"f380c7db-b56b-4dc3-befc-7cbfd7786a4e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"ca513ab1-d8be-4ed7-914b-285efbde3d1c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"643c236f-2f0d-46e2-a7f2-560140f590dc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"1e128f56-24c7-4048-8b82-a6e1df80942f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"79b0d7be-2e69-4298-b455-6219351c5816.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"60ec5d02-7aa5-41e7-890e-d89a47ada35f.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"7cb18daa-b2ed-4752-addc-fe91e2357e4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":27257,"FileName":"b0f4658e-0ed9-49e3-ae72-32997112d413.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33877,"Name":"Sonic Eraser","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog.

There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/MgHo2FApgMI","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"aee28aeb-bb6b-4a7e-b1a0-d9e903b6bc3e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"6b4550c4-d2ad-44d5-a4b8-5f9975c33bcf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"9ac99eb2-fb8a-42b9-b604-9c24bf7a150d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"1924b364-98db-42c8-9634-d2ac01d3b052.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"03faf2b3-cf45-409b-bc7d-e8c84e555338.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"91843025-81af-4e4a-b050-edd62fae6ff3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"d4700293-cdb9-4f83-aae2-54c71cf08a6b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"ae3cd42a-d8d8-431d-b976-749c83873755.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"7dff9d75-aaaf-4653-9ca6-c836dff9a078.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33877,"FileName":"28f27d3b-a00c-4ec3-925a-340fe1a19df1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163140,"Name":"Sonic Gaiden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This hack is significant in the Sonic ROM-hacking community for several reasons. First, it's a hack of a Sonic 1 title; at the time of its release, such hacks were slightly rarer as Sonic 2 was the most frequently hacked Sonic game. Secondly, it is a hack of the Japanese Sonic 1 ROM; the U.S. Sonic 1 is more commonly used, but the Japanese revision has added features such as scrolling clouds and rippling water. Thirdly, the hack allows the option to play as either Sonic or as Mighty the Armadillo, who became popular as a founding member of the Chaotix crew and as a playable character in SegaSonic the Hedgehog. In addition, the hack includes new levels with new artwork and separate endings for each character.\n\nThe hack is a co-operative effort between two noteworthy hackers in the community, Yuski the Dog and Esrael Neto. Esrael is most famous for his work on Sonic 2 Delta, a hack of the Sonic 2 Beta ROM which re-coded all the incomplete elements and restored deleted levels. Yuski had created a previous hack in 2000 called Mighty the Armadillo which was a sprite and palette hack of the U.S. Sonic 1 ROM. Sonic Gaiden was born when Esrael e-mailed Yuski a Sonic 1 ROM-hack with both Sonic and Mighty playable.\n\nThe difference between Sonic and Mighty is purely cosmetic. Choosing between the two is simply a matter of which sprites will be loaded. Therefore, not only do they both have identical abilities, but Mighty's trademark moves such as spin-dashing and wall-kicking are absent.\n\nIt is worth noting that Mighty may have been an original design prototype for Sonic. Despite only having appeared in a couple of Sonic games, he has gained a small fan following.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNPvwZdgPBw","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Yuski and Esrael Neto","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2004-05-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163140,"FileName":"9b5f3a20-6da3-4600-8f03-3f8352aaabce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":163140,"FileName":"ec955fe9-ff77-4e78-8d2b-0a1b7a94d34d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163140,"FileName":"905614f0-d8c3-4bbd-bd51-64862677f892.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163140,"FileName":"0f8a6ba3-9619-4d68-83b5-2a459133d1cc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176420,"Name":"Sonic Legacy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sonic Legacy is a fairly simple hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with every level being edited to some degree, with scripted event-heavy levels receiving the fewest edits due to lack of ASM skills and overall inexperience with Sonic hacking.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Custom music\n• Per-Act song changes\n• Changes to 6 of the 7 Special Stages (The editor for these is very limited, so they might be a bit messy.)\n• Some bits of new artwork","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Gamma V","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2017-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":176420,"FileName":"8779f8b6-122f-4456-b9b8-8c5309f1c4da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176420,"FileName":"e2c6d95a-3e53-4238-8225-a05a1adfb270.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176420,"FileName":"0ea20c0a-bee3-4017-b4f1-f7c45bd0e790.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176420,"FileName":"1a05fa26-2f0f-4f6b-95ba-922a78f3f3d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176420,"FileName":"9db323b8-09dd-4148-afef-98dfaa6d691c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146296,"Name":"Sonic Pixel Perfect","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sonic 1 Pixel Perfect is a ROM hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis byil JclFerg Zone layout (with edited boss) as of the first beta release.gy and NovaWizard.

It combines the levels of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 to make one large game. Special stages from both games are accessible and are entered via each game’s special stage original entry method. This means Giant rings at the end of stages when retaining 50 rings in Sonic 1 and jumping into a circle of stars after passing checkpoints with enough rings in Sonic 2. There are 6 Chaos Emeralds in the Sonic 1 special stages and 7 in the Sonic 2 special stages. Super Sonic is not available until all Chaos Emeralds are obtained from both kinds of special stages. Progress is saved automatically to SRAM.\nPressing Start and the A button while playing any stage will return the player to the title screen. Also, level select is available by holding A button then pressing Start at the title screen.\nArena mode is playable which has time challenges that can be completed to increase the players ranking.

There are challenges in the forms of full game playthrough and boss attack. In full game playthrough the HUD can be set to global mode showing the overall records during gameplay. During normal gameplay and during challenges pausing the game and pressing A will return the player to the overworld.\n\nFifty achievements are available by pressing Start on the Overworld. If using a certain emulator available at Sonic Retro the ability to upload results and achievements are available meaning you can compete with other players. Otherwise achievements will be disabled and results will be saved differently.\n\nThe hack also supports SonMP3 which enables custom mp3 soundtracks.

Amy Rose's sprites are designed after her modern look. Amy Rose with classic-style sprites is available to play in the Amy Rose in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 hack.\n\nThe game was modified by Sonic Retro Member E-122-Psi, with additional programming and coding by other members including MarkeyJester, MainMemory, FraGag, Selbi, and Hayate. Most programming unique from Amy In Sonic 2 such as Cream the Rabbit's gameplay was implemented by Flamewing.\n\nAmy Rose\nAmy's abilities mirror those she utilized in the Sonic Advance series. She is slower than Sonic and can't use spin attacks; however, she has a number of abilities (mostly using her Piko Piko Hammer) to gain maneuverability and access areas Sonic had difficulty reaching:\n\nHammer Attack: Press A and Amy swings her hammer, damaging enemies. In addition, Amy can use her hammer to smash obstacles such as walls and hit springs.\nHammer Jump: Press Down + A on the ground and Amy smashes the hammer into the ground, launching her into the air.\nHammer Whirl: Press Down + A in the air and Amy swirls down toward the ground. If an enemy is hit Amy will bounce up again.\nUpward Dash: Hold Down + B/C while on the ground and Amy will rev her feet on the spot as opposed to a spin dash. Let go of Down to charge full throttle in the facing direction. Be careful though, Amy is vulnerable to blockading obstacles and enemies.\nAmy gains a few stipulations akin to Knuckles in Sonic 2; for example, the ring quota in Special Stages are depleted and she retains her ring count after losing lives or entering starposts.\n\nCream the Rabbit\nSpin Dash: Hold Down + B/C while on the ground and Cream will rev up in ball form to perform a spin dash.

A magnificent land; one that is not bound by restrictions such as time.\n\n15 years have passed since Sonic the Hedgehog's first plight against the nefarious Dr. Eggman (originally known as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in English localisations). Ever since, the two sides have clashed nonstop in a variety of settings, with the eventual outcome always being Sonic's victory. Both sides have gained both new allies and new enemies; some helpful, others... not so much. Naturally, throughout this time, Sonic has learned a few new techniques, which he uses to further stifle Eggman's plans of world domination. And so, the world is safe - but always just out of Eggman's grasp.\n\nSome say history repeats itself. In this case, the statement is proven true, as Eggman returns to South Island, in hopes that he can obtain the land's powerful Chaos Emeralds, and finally put forth a solid step in conquering the planet. As he arrives on the island, he brings with him a single Chaos Emerald - one that had been missing, and had upset the natural balance of the island for decades beforehand. The others were trapped in an alternate dimension; one which only very few could enter, and from which even fewer returned.\n\nOf course, Eggman isn't very good at keeping his plans secret (a big reason why they're foiled so easily). As a result, Sonic hears of this, and readies his travel back to South Island. With him, he brings two allies: one being Mighty the Armadillo, a longtime friend of his (though they had not spoken in quite some time); and the other being Shadow the Hedgehog who, after finally getting over his angst (at least for the moment), felt like teaching Eggman a thing or two about trying the same thing twice. And besides that, he had never seen South Island before; he had heard things about it, certainly, but never saw it for himself. So, he figured, why not?\n\nAnd so, the three begin their trek of South Island, each taking their own unique abilities with them, and going their separate ways, each in search of the remaining Chaos Emeralds, and of Eggman, in hopes that once he is defeated, he will finally abandon his plans of world domination. But, then again, that's not very likely to happen.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Team Megamix","ReleaseDate":"2008-08-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128622,"FileName":"a398e1be-3c5e-454e-99d9-000065b8ce74.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128622,"FileName":"bcbeea02-c622-49c1-93d7-97fba1391098.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128622,"FileName":"0feb9888-2566-4a0c-91a1-911f3b753246.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128622,"FileName":"b9f2bc3c-8c45-4296-81b5-a1a55b70cc2f.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128622,"AlternateName":"Sonic MegaMix","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128622,"AlternateName":"Sonic The Hedgehog Mega Mix","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":692,"Name":"Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sonic The Hedgehog spins into pinball pandemonium!

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"39dcce2f-a2ae-472f-8b9f-2e6defadaa29.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"d4359bef-7de3-4010-9ef5-4f905dff0fdd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"d831e971-fed5-45ac-acb8-b8f3e0f05ee8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"d063aa1e-8c44-4939-b5ee-1504c05e2e4c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"60c706e2-58fb-4ee5-8775-1b5027377b51.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"edbbf808-2329-4ed8-92b3-4606df2cfde0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"bfe8fe60-775e-4942-853b-c9079a2efeae.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"3978ac32-75eb-4a42-9a6f-6de01e568458.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20448,"FileName":"004d4e46-7245-46af-b893-fda2481c3724.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26693,"Name":"Soul Blade","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Soul Blade is a pirated port of the PlayStation game of the same name, made for the SNES and Sega Genesis by an unknown developer in 1997.

In the final chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped his beloved family members. He has no choice but to wear the demon mask with the supernatural powers to save Jennifer and David from the demon-infested Splatterhouse.\n\nThe third title in the series builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a race against time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to the boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance, special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.\n\nIt still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence. You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time.

Both a Sega CD and a PC port were teased sometime in 1993-1994, but both would eventually be canceled by LucasArts themselves.\n\nIn Europe, a Sega Mega Drive port of Super Star Wars was teased and even shown in various magazines throughout 1993. The port was being done by Sega Interactive, formally known as Interactive Designs. A more ambitious version the Sega CD was also planned which would've included CD quality audio and FMV sequences. Aside from a few scarce screenshots of the first level and oddly some shots from a developer's workstation, this is all the information that would be gathered on the project. The game was soon canceled for unknown reasons along with the rest of the planned ports of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Sega Interactive","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":174521,"FileName":"c964244e-d67c-47d4-a410-bb962cac9764.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174521,"FileName":"197b3ead-d139-4be0-acb7-778847aaeee9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174521,"FileName":"38d5d953-f496-4e5a-bdce-6e601c333563.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174521,"FileName":"5dcd9830-93c5-481d-9922-c85a4b62fdb2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174521,"FileName":"a20a654a-d94f-4c11-ad75-44e1fa8cd8f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4636,"Name":"Starflight","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars.

Similar to Super Mario Kart, the game allows the user to select one of many cartoon-like characters, racing around a circuit, avoiding obstacles and using special items.\n\nDue to various hardware restrictions, gameplay differs among platforms - the Mega Drive version of the game has the player travel along a road in a similar manner to Hang On or OutRun, whereas the Saturn version renders its levels through 3D geometry, allowing the user to see more of the stage. The Japanese Saturn version of the game is called Street Racer Extra (ストリート　レーサー　エクストラ) due to these additions.\n\nThe Mega Drive version of the game was not released in Japan or North America, though did make it to Brazil and Europe. Plans for a North American version were put in place (even getting to the stage of having its own box art with ESRB rating), but were cancelled. Likewise the Saturn version of the game was not released in North America.

You can also explore the levels, but keep an eye on your fuel gauge and beware the many hazards!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Zyrinx","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"fbad957e-87e4-4d9e-b359-17da56058819.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"85453a49-21a3-4991-81ee-e08856b1c1ed.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"9675ef66-4dd5-44db-b85b-994559bb981f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"c4911144-dff7-4570-8f06-c69af3b0d7fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"ef387132-a97e-45c7-8337-90042dd9a96b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"28c8c41d-94eb-420c-b241-05bde9000fac.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"0205b4f3-4928-43dd-9770-122fe4d49194.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"076cf543-9233-4a12-8320-614cba566d8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"6b096cd0-1102-430c-80fe-a3836562bd23.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"4f00638a-a62f-4dd4-956a-91579c7ca311.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"965e4504-4bce-4b7b-8d0b-82448f62c0b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"8ac1de93-76d9-464c-a180-fabc8df5924d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"19adbc3f-233f-458f-bd42-4a90a8d3b5ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"4c33a0bd-6d13-477b-a6ef-bd6ef51bf667.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"bb9957fd-9c3c-4106-81e0-60467f48ce4e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"fa58dee2-bdcb-43c4-ac84-bdd8577ccb28.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"5a7427e1-2320-4b7c-945c-211d94296986.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"17c4eacc-aef7-4221-8ff9-1673600f798f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"b2a03c97-2829-40cd-9663-2b6092e0cb7b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"0aa217ab-a83f-4730-b366-94f39ca6db30.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"863a21aa-b7b1-49e2-a4f7-3c650a66d044.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"29442da4-3a55-4644-9654-7c822caf4b8f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"15d98069-a934-4cb5-bec9-9de42926e526.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"a1551053-252a-40e9-b9c4-b914fb36317d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"af2394a6-ff89-4542-8961-136f05026a4c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"c83bd0e4-ad61-4578-abb0-ba27c42b6399.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"f09c4ca1-c97d-4e9f-aa8c-cb12cbb6964d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"29d34cb2-697d-45ff-bfbc-11748420d10b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"c77ac7f7-7dc7-4805-ae7c-4edbc37f982b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"bca98ce9-ca0c-4aa7-94ce-6b315dd61bc5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"a6af4325-80d0-43d8-860c-ff504eaf6a4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2584,"FileName":"876f1a5f-1be8-4056-a557-4aec8ba86dba.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20532,"Name":"Summer Challenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from athletics to cycling.

From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKmnhC1kNNA","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Probe Software","Publisher":"Arena Entertainment","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"2b79ae5d-834b-4c8e-bbd5-3b4a327dc864.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"5d31e9be-661d-4c77-a8fc-416cb69667da.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"afb87f5f-bbf1-4f76-b854-e491453de358.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"3619f352-56af-44b6-9b49-a7ab571b1511.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"f1eee408-f847-4a91-99b4-43bae5cd3239.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"4c15a520-03c9-4728-8368-64110a1123ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"0b351413-788b-4f62-849d-3df2f951ac06.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"b41a5453-3b5b-4f07-840e-a7a28fe32be6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"7796aec8-a03a-4e59-b8b4-ce2c521c7e47.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"91ef1057-4775-4439-b20a-abf141a6962d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"b6c21012-eeb6-40e2-a1a6-d815ed450829.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"d8b45d8c-045e-4672-ae4c-ae7b72bad013.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"3995cf43-ade4-4764-9bb1-8001c9e679d5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"0969f881-91b5-407f-beee-4122dbc8a790.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":4651,"FileName":"da3adecd-5276-4761-b4c7-c70ef0079c3d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20440,"Name":"Taikou Risshiden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Taikou Risshiden is an open-ended strategy RPG set in Sengoku-period Japan, where the player takes the role of a subordinate of warlord Oda Nobunaga named Tōkichirō Kinoshita. The player chooses one of several possible professions, rolls their attributes, and must become successful in their chosen life.\n\nEach month, the player receives orders from Nobunaga, and depending on the player's performance, their status will rise or fall. Success will allow the player to rise in rank and status, while failure will see the player's influence diminish, and possibly even result in execution. Depending on the player's actions, the scenario may stick closely to historical fact, or diverge wildly.\n\nThe player can travel to various locations via the overworld map, and depending upon their play style, several different modes of play may open up. The player can choose to engage their enemies in turn-based tactical battles, or foster peace through diplomacy. It is also possible to go gambling, date women, and even assassinate enemy (or friendly) characters. However, all actions will have an impact on the player's reputation.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Koei","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"d87865a5-a492-480a-af36-c3c4e83f3f7d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"32dfd9ab-a46d-4e92-bd0c-cfc5553377c6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"cc73ca02-3aec-42e7-acc8-a972e2986f3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"fd427218-4bca-471f-b82b-8c917262c332.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"70e9ec95-7897-4b4f-8fc9-6458c2eea1e8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"f1a8f02d-2594-48ee-a8cb-56191189e1e2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"00ff1c2e-fc16-401e-a225-4f7a0f9a3776.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"FileName":"e2fd2fc3-4bae-47a6-a855-9d44e3519c9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":20440,"AlternateName":"Taikou Risshiden","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20440,"AlternateName":"Taikō Risshiden","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":132735,"Name":"Taiwan Daheng","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Taiwan Daheng (台湾大亨) is an unlicensed Sega Mega Drive video board game released in Taiwan by C&E Inc. in 1994.

This was the European name; in America it was called Tecmo Cup Soccer Game. In Japan where the game originated, it was called Captain Tsubasa and was based around the media franchise of the same name. As such, rather than being a straight soccer simulation, Tecmo Cup Football Game takes a more cinematic/RPG-esque approach to the sport, with the actual game being presented cinematicly and moves made by choosing from menus in a limited time.\n\nA version under the European name was being programmed for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993; only Sega and Tecmo are listed as involved companies and the programming appears to be unique to this game. The game was not released in any region; the reason why is unknown. A prototype ROM can be found in many ROM sites; it is usually called Tecmo Cup, is listed as being from Japan, and is listed as a bad dump (presumably because the header was hacked out of Twinkle Tale, which does have in common with this game one thing: using the MC68000's line 1111 emulator trap to do common routines, though the actual routines are different). Because the westernized game is still similar to Captain Tsubasa in many ways, it is often pirated by Asian pirates as a genuine Captain Tsubasa game","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"8aecfa89-6b1b-4f99-a49d-ae054f3e0c4b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"08e927c7-4e1a-45c4-a8a2-f15690da7958.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"622fcc4f-5bf4-4a2c-989c-f4437e0043a2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"1fbac08b-5cca-4418-8d52-a4b265b732ee.PNG","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"585610dd-c56a-445e-ba82-04f3ce79b83f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"e203c651-6237-4a52-b624-83f9bdcd28f7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"635c2706-1102-46e8-8659-73d48feae24a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"cfa36e4b-2b92-48aa-a60c-fab5d9a8b5ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"26223f79-ff7f-4659-a58e-bca78dbf9f15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"a0f73ea7-0750-4102-99d6-28edf9d60423.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34043,"FileName":"c7661b21-eff4-4b4c-9891-84b473c6b042.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2490,"Name":"Tecmo Super Baseball","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Tecmo Super Baseball has 700 authentic MLBPA players including Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn and Barry Bonds to name a few.

In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.\nThe game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shirukens in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.\nThe game is regarded as being extremely difficult to complete, and also known for showcasing some of the most impressive special effects on the Mega Drive/Genesis. It also features a soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. This accounts for the relatively high quality of Kyd's compositions, as well as the fairly simple FM synthesized nature of the game's sound effects.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bWAwSRQ7fA","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Clockwork Tortoise","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"1c403308-4bcd-4d18-976c-0612ee99b7e3.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"033f2876-aa4c-43de-9283-8be7910af3a0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"ceebb132-8a75-4c6b-ad8b-46af9d5327d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"dcc50642-f517-4f2b-8ed7-73653a2d4ea2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"e2c07389-b1ca-4230-b49b-18bc2f16af8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"85888945-95a8-4472-b350-9ecbc88ac9ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"f83464d5-c09d-400e-8ce8-84742cf65ba5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"097928f3-9841-49cb-8deb-6e3a5f0b5da6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"895f049e-846e-4f1d-9bb2-dbccd2b08299.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"8a84de5b-e48f-40e0-adb3-5c0068195139.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"7278169c-cadc-463f-b3fb-500dd34c0682.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"df3831f4-28b2-4372-802b-444843bb98ca.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"722299a5-ea4b-46cb-8756-8a13960c1cfb.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"87ed0bfc-d435-4587-8f25-a45e0d5ae5db.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"f892dcd5-145d-457a-b4c4-dce7f513b222.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"22be037e-8bb1-4ba6-8181-4a4050b4b718.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"7e0da129-cce9-4ab4-aad7-68d55fdc2cb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"4525936c-bc66-4093-a6d4-68a147f032af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"ada40f6a-22e7-4041-afa4-9d802f1dda21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"d959680e-d71c-4020-8ed3-a09f81792cf2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"68d2e1ce-0b94-4e96-9d3e-1645de33e720.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9415,"FileName":"23b80a38-f0a6-4df1-89dd-4c8eb01d1d67.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4235,"Name":"The Adventures of Mighty Max","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows you to travel across different world and to save people who get in trouble in other dimensions.

But one day, their land was attacked, and the talisman stolen. A brave warrior went out to investigate the talisman's disappearance, but returned mortally wounded. Before he died, he told his three sons that the talisman was stolen by the evil Necromancer, and must be retrieved at all costs...\n\nThe Faery Tale Adventure is a role-playing game in which the player can assume control of any of the three brothers - Julian, Philip, or Kevin. Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently.\n\nMuch of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring the large world, interacting with non-playable characters and building up the brothers' combat abilities by participating in battles. The fastest-growing parameter is bravery, which is comparable to experience points and strength combined. Each defeated enemy yields bravery points; as it grows, so does the hero's vitality (maximum hit points), albeit at a slower rate. Combat system is rather simple and is done in action style, with the player pressing a key or a mouse button while navigating the protagonist towards or away from the enemy. Predating Ultima V, the game has a day and night cycle, and the main character has to eat and rest.\n\nThe Faery Tale Adventure is notable for having a very vast world, usually considered the largest ever created for a video game at the time of its release. Players can explore approximately 17,000 screens of terrain. The world is also interconnected, i.e. there are no transitions between different types of areas. Items can be dropped by enemies as well as found anywhere in the game's world. There is also NPC interaction and quests the protagonist can undertake.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5_4DhXWdwo","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"8fea337a-4405-4198-b9aa-575b45ddfa52.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"d7401c5d-3b0c-427d-93fc-beb88b68b1e0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"b3c614d1-16c0-4fe0-b563-c165ef305478.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"19007ea9-f6e7-4035-880f-9380a5b9ec08.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"950b6661-e379-461b-b524-8da0f03066a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"f4d2756e-7168-4ed3-8431-12f6055b6efb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"09d59de1-4843-41ff-86d6-e6723cf8a866.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"7787e0db-f72c-4892-98b6-a8f2845cb9b9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4665,"FileName":"81bc4eb6-3549-41e5-a3c6-124be6c43d8a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4666,"Name":"The Flintstones","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bedrock is cracking up!

In North America, it was given a tentative release date of November 1994, then December, while an Australian release was planned for May 1995.\n\nWhile the full game has yet to be found, an early prototype was eventually found and dumped by drx in 2019, and released on Hidden Palace on December 31st, 2019 as part of the Holiday 2019 releases.

Notably, it was the first game with Minnie Mouse in a video game role.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Iu_GOxsE0","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"1d3a4a6d-ae63-4ae6-828b-b92079c1eb21.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"6c2b58f9-d139-4535-b581-d54b41d26ff6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"60a17454-10e3-4764-8ff6-d71ff48a111b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"4226d35e-35a0-460a-8902-9c2d4a54503a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"d2700a38-4db2-440f-a581-1040ef5024d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"fe35c5f2-589b-42c1-909a-8e46785cc6c4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"f9c2dd6e-8cba-4f06-95e8-66dd51bc1bb3.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"27648438-8ae7-4c79-9455-ef5732e3cfec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"50618458-5f0f-4927-a2aa-7e10ceaab540.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"eceac034-3c0a-42d5-8b21-4b08a47990d1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"3cd68945-0a50-4f63-bd54-f52a42ca27ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":301,"FileName":"fbf5deae-6971-4443-8917-7642602687f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":301,"AlternateName":"The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey & Minnie","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":301,"AlternateName":"Disney's Magical Quest 2 Starring Mickey & Minnie","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":301,"AlternateName":"Great Circus Mystery: Mickey to Minnie Magical Adventure 2","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":4668,"Name":"The Great Waldo Search","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"When Whitebeard the wizard lost his powerful magic scrolls, he knew who to turn to for help - Waldo!

This company had greater control over operations in space than any government, and even had their own army. They declared war on the Earth... and won.\n\nNow, in the 26th century, Earth has fallen into ruin, with the governing body PETO under the complete control of CoCoON. All forms of weaponry were outlawed on Earth for anything other than government use, but mercenary groups, simply known as \"couriers\", have sprung up to transport illicit military goods.\n\nThe Hybrid Front is a sci-fi turn-based strategy game where the player takes control of a team of mercenary couriers. The game plays much like Daisenyaku or Advance Wars, featuring grid-based movement with a multitude of unit and terrain types. Different types of units have varying effectiveness against other units and different terrain types.\n\nEach mission has a specific victory condition that must be met; this may be as simple as destroying a target, but may also require a certain number of units escaping to safety, or protecting a specific point. The game features a strong emphasis on the scenario, with dialogue sequences throughout each mission and a detailed encyclopedia mode featuring information on the cast and the weaponry.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLasNcmcwM0","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"3c59b0e7-ebd1-482c-83cc-b635e97fb511.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"bd86628c-f3cd-41c9-b837-d480250658f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"a0b663fd-a334-404f-997c-b1cdd4176cd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"ba3e2f03-af6a-41c2-98aa-d166446a1ddd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"578c565b-c77a-4c6f-9fb1-f2497e5302a5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"df243b92-70a6-4c56-9d00-0a7d80c15aca.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"8b1f92a5-5d58-4d6c-bf9e-03592eff0aae.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20383,"FileName":"92fbe2fd-ba08-44cb-ab2c-10ef712c6ea6.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":489,"Name":"The Immortal","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared - probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: eight levels of traps and deadly enemies await.\n\nThe Immortal is an isometric game with puzzle-solving and action combat. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, the game offers a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river.\n\nThe dungeon isn't empty: some friendly characters may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvVFnGYuv_M","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"80f51bc2-7ae0-4df9-9ee3-cb0c2ae0eb3c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"e57b60f7-acd1-45a0-acba-4d34c259742e.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"6c923646-8447-4e3d-a026-7e744bc99219.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"371307db-5b2c-44df-b16f-9d21ffdd73b4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"d6dc7643-198e-428f-a012-ff6c78a17fbb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"96130c2f-bc38-4f45-a618-6f00bda81677.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"c8eb89ca-9607-4d1f-a084-8f763239a2c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"ebd30b62-3eef-4cb2-99eb-f527ce0c84c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"ea5f7356-3155-4e12-8746-9d0b77678d42.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"4b07f327-8cb0-4c13-a8da-b476fbfde5d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"b6f6dbeb-6f96-436f-a2c8-12bad8b2f80a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"228279f6-0ff8-4724-b6c6-d3e3c5220753.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"50026b68-d5f2-4b73-b2e9-2d13010bab74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"d66b7b92-7993-467b-906a-cdd4b30c042e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"a0606075-eeb9-4b95-b783-0f84ac965fbd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"69dd0395-e2f9-4eab-8352-fd7dfa00748e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"583ecfd0-e560-4f87-9790-ee54c7db398d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"39ada50b-d711-4d16-a00e-6c55c0fe436a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"c69e95a8-338a-4c6f-9d4b-f63a865d754c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"ed00fe0d-dc50-4674-8856-01e4ed36563b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"69e288ce-5264-4d7e-a86b-4ab9fe5cf6d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"3ab987a4-b406-4324-a0b7-45477f2d1ff7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"31437cfa-5369-4859-827d-cd427f81cbbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":489,"FileName":"d9a043ac-d451-4323-bcb6-bab36c90438c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":489,"AlternateName":"Wizard of the Immortal","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":489,"AlternateName":"The Immortal","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":489,"AlternateName":"Will Harvey Presents The Immortal","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":489,"AlternateName":"The Immortal","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":4669,"Name":"The Incredible Crash Dummies","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Don't you be a dummy.

It is based on the 1994 film The Lion King (as opposed to its 1998 sequel which shares the Lion King II title). It was developed by Gamtec at an unknown date, and uses sound effects from other unlicensed Mega Drive games. For example, the sound for Simba slashing enemies is the select sound from Rockman X3, and the sound when picking up an item is from Squirrel King.\nA sequel, Lion King 3, was developed later on, and is also based on the first movie.\n\nThere are two playable characters: Simba and Mufasa, the latter can be played by collecting a golden star. Simba can be reaccessed when touching an enemy, and torches act as checkpoints; the player's lion can activate them by jumping up when next to a torch.\n\nTrivia\nReprints of the original cartridge contain an unintentional bug, possibly due to faulty patching to copy protection found in the original game. The bug causes both invincibility and unlimited lives. Although the life meter does not decrease, the player will still transform from lion to cub if attacked by an enemy.\n\nRather controversially, a swastika (or more specifically, a Manji, which the Swastika was based off) appears on one of the machines in one of the stages.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyCz6Cizboo","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Gamtec","Publisher":"X Boy","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"86dc08f7-35a5-4beb-9bf5-7fc140b81ca7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"ab0bcc1c-a590-43d2-b254-c0fbcf47ac4f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"b09e1a04-3f8f-4ff6-bc5d-5ac583140bbe.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"a0f44f0f-fcd8-45b3-99b1-4cabff51f2e7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"73c1af89-baf2-4fd5-a3b6-e6499138f7d8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"055b105a-5f88-4787-b2f7-13b98e678df2.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"38c6466b-259d-4682-865f-78d773669279.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"FileName":"63289a31-59fc-4f97-9a70-22e0fc9bfe75.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":141320,"AlternateName":"Shi Zi Wang 2","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"AlternateName":"Shīziwáng II","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"AlternateName":"The Lion King 2","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141320,"AlternateName":"The Lion King II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":544,"Name":"The Lost Vikings","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"It's just another cool day of Nordic seafaring and pillaging when Erik the Swift™, Beleog the Fierce™ and Olaf the Stout™ are suddenly sucked into an alien spaceship.

The Mega Drive version of the game was not widely covered and was largely unheard of until the title screen music by Tim Follin, was released online. Some years later, development documents were acquired and a prototype ROM was released to the general public in July 2013.\n\nIt is not known why the Mega Drive version of the game was cancelled - a Super Nintendo version was released in North America and Europe in early 1994, suggesting the Mega Drive version was originally set to be released around this period. Malibu would be sold to GameTek in the coming months which may explain its disappearance. A different Time Trax was released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1986.\n\nThe game is notable for its use of a relatively advanced sound driver designed by Dean Belfield for Follin - one which was never used in any other Mega Drive games neither before or since.

The game then switches to a first-person view, also showing the fisher from a side-view on a separate part of the screen, and it is possible to look around in the environment.\n\nCasting is done using a power meter to determine the distance. As the bait sinks, a monitor can be checked for nearby fish. There are also visual clues through splashing water. The player can check the depth and reel in when needed. When a fish has been caught, it becomes a sensitive play with the line tension to make sure it does not snap shown through the side-view of the fisher. At the end of the day the boat can go back to the weighing area to determine the results. Money earned in the tournaments can be used to acquire new spin reels, bait reels, boats, lines and lures.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Imagitec","Publisher":"American Softworks","ReleaseDate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4686,"FileName":"3a3a2e6d-08ea-4667-8040-dd5be63c4ab0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4686,"FileName":"7a9f00d2-bc9f-4128-b774-df5d547701f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4686,"FileName":"a60b5c05-fa5f-42d2-8cf4-44968aaff3e7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4686,"FileName":"52172d63-01ef-4a11-a4fc-e750d98e8441.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4686,"FileName":"1d7406d7-37d6-4dee-8ddc-622327291448.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2574,"Name":"TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96 is the sequel to TNN Bass Tournament of Champions.

Each course has multiple stages. To advance, you must reach various checkpoints within the allotted time limits. Your score increases as you race on-track. If you veer off-track or have a collision, your score will temporarily stop increasing.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned Arcade Mode, Super Hang-On features a special Original Mode exclusive to the Genesis. This mode of play features a different circuit and more options. With the money you'll earn from winning or placing in races, you can hire a mechanic and buy better parts (such as mufflers, brakes and frames) to upgrade your bike.\n\nThe next game on the cartridge, World Championship Soccer, features 24 international teams battling for a spot in the Final Tournament. Each team is ranked according to skill from one to five. Individual players are rated according to speed, kicking strength, tackling strength and accuracy. When selecting a team, you must choose 11 starters from a roster of 16.\n\nIf you don't want to enter the tournament, you can play a special one or two-player Test Match, which consists of a single game of soccer. If a game ends in a tie, the winner will be determined by a series of penalty kicks. The penalty kick screen puts you behind the kicker while the rest of the action in World Championship Soccer features an overhead view.\n\nLast but not least is Columns, a Tetris-like game that takes you out of the world of sports and into the ancient land of Phoenicia. Originated among the Phoenician merchants, Columns has you arranging columns of rainbow-colored jewels (three jewels per column) that drop one by one from the top of the playfield. Your objective is to line up like-colored jewels horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in order to make the jewels in that row disappear. If the columns pile up to the top of the playfield, the game will end.\n\nIn addition to the standard game of Columns, you can play Flash Columns in which you must make a flashing jewel disappear before time runs out. Also, two players can play Doubles (alternating on one field of play) or split-screen mode (two separate games going at once).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Racing; Sports","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"321a4941-5874-44cf-9bc1-1f06bb8bf685.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"37695eb0-b1c0-4bd5-a773-53d76af01037.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"2d114f69-74b0-4499-a14f-5f227db09c61.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"97d806f4-bdf9-4221-95ff-6c612c502efd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"ef763106-f152-4526-bf37-a54f53a10a12.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"7dd0ab2f-83c4-438d-86bb-814fd6a2d771.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"a6693990-cade-4412-81d5-ccc7d69c3d1f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"a2d60502-7f12-4443-b5d7-dbd7f4fd39bb.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"d3bd00b0-f447-45a9-8d85-cfa666561e42.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"430ec8dc-96b9-4ae7-9d88-e797ba9d2569.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"f616ef4c-aea1-4aa0-99c9-6d54b49cf9d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"FileName":"fcf2c1e2-b57b-4fd7-9bad-71cc6bd565ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":122641,"AlternateName":"Mega Games I","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"AlternateName":"Triple Score: 3 Games in 1","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122641,"AlternateName":"Mega Games 1","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":2623,"Name":"Trouble Shooter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sometimes the best man for the job is a woman...\n\nWhen King Fredrick's only son and heir to the throne is kidnapped by Blackball, the mutant military weapons genius, an international disaster seems imminent.\n\nColonel Patch quickly contacts the \"Trouble Shooter\" to find Prince Eldon and destroy Blackball and his treacherous robotic underworld.

Though the North American version of the game never made it to store shelves, a prototype ROM has been found.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Ww5Q0sGxk","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"PanelComp","Publisher":"Virgin Games","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34092,"FileName":"c7b1d256-8046-4014-8435-f74c1cd8c5a6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34092,"FileName":"52c393cc-dbbe-47b2-83b2-fbe9da26eb4c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34092,"FileName":"82826f06-c787-431f-926b-c6cd7954be5d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34092,"FileName":"eb0eade4-26ef-41b5-85ad-012dcb4bdfa2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34092,"FileName":"ad6cf122-a005-4c01-9304-c5aa45e56f30.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34092,"FileName":"76987996-0abd-484e-94e5-a954c73117c0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":34092,"AlternateName":"Two Tribes: Populous II","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":34092,"AlternateName":"Populous II: Two Tribes","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34092,"AlternateName":"Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":4702,"Name":"Tyrants: Fight Through Time","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. \n\nLand is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzxwhTRTuT4","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sensible Software","Publisher":"Virgin Games","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"d30e67cb-1e1c-4a61-aa81-8bd440bf04d8.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"68ca3c42-966d-4f8d-8b0a-6277ceaa6648.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"eb9e6778-4fb1-4ce2-a8aa-13079ecc9b89.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"b7e7fc9e-0757-4733-9c77-e0110da1c9dc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"0cd6d2a0-1696-4fa2-aca1-f26fd713d834.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"8df8947a-c5e0-4add-a1d4-2d6d90e40451.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"794169f7-f0bb-4828-b509-d7b93698930a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"21f3683b-3022-4b2e-b293-c3a55325ea38.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"a1f68ed7-3252-4bda-8750-9fd37149f6e9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"be0b09c5-b4fd-4096-9d1a-ff0657d24ae3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"847b37da-40da-4c5d-a93f-f7702e553a91.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"50711303-d77d-44f7-9b46-16ceb2dcfa4e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"4581bab3-3b6d-4dfd-a933-7ba3a52bffae.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"afbcf563-8a80-4da8-bdea-e2f63f153d6d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"2f6bd1dc-c40f-4115-818d-74c644685636.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"6a9f686f-449e-4df9-8c8b-ab52f616823b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"a74e5234-9288-41c4-ba63-bdd6bc8e5e1a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"a5e88206-9b10-4d49-aff6-b56a7101786b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"211590d0-6ebd-4dc4-9216-9381f768d728.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"45e65734-3909-4e9b-8900-cb545ea782d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"FileName":"63ea69f7-06c5-4056-8228-c5fa537448f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4702,"AlternateName":"Mega-Lo-Mania","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"AlternateName":"Mega Lo Mania","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":4702,"AlternateName":"Tyrants: Fight Through Time","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":4703,"Name":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 combines the best of all the Mortal Kombats into a single cartridge. 23 playable characters are immediately available, such as Reptile, Cyrax, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, Katana, Sonya, and more.

There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.\n\nThe gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum.

A team of three Alpha-type robot spaceships was sent to the nearest neighboring system to seek out new sources, mine them, and send the scarce materials back to Earth.\n\nOne day, while the team was investigating the planet called Voltegeus, it suddenly ceased to transmit and could not be contacted. Many years passed without a sign, and the ships were given up for lost. Then, Earth Defense Headquarters received word from Pluto Base of a huge unidentified object approaching our system. An infra-scan probe revealed the three Alpha ships at its core. In the hands of a hostile alien intelligence, the ships had been transformed into a gigantic, heavily-armed, flying fortress - bent on destroying Earth!\n\nThe defenses of Earth have all failed to halt the juggernaut of destruction, and it now threatens to obliterate the planet.

Once the word has been spelled, the newly found wabbits leave fruit, stars, and clocks that increase the time limit. The time limit can also be extended by picking up a glowing orange orb which appears during the last ten seconds of the counter, adding thirty seconds to it.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Raising Hell Software","Publisher":"Psygnosis","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"d33dfa51-092c-4ad6-9ec4-81f349e2278c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"e4f2e177-cbe3-4394-96ee-097a3e080af6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"5c8da1c1-9623-4578-ac9a-ddf4cf5e4084.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"b4c93774-6ae0-4d36-a4c1-8ade801a38c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"a7315d90-de65-41fc-9639-3d1a39c289e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"b790c621-fec7-4620-a768-11da761dde14.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"42d0d79d-29c8-462f-b96c-2753f887eeff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"7999eda3-d399-4d61-9c48-cf822af6fcc8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"321e44ca-75d6-45ba-84ed-2c269964d9a8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"c6c4b5de-2a0a-4450-95ec-6cc06dd758b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"2c3b0fca-6981-401d-b54e-cc6a0c734ed4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"dbfb5f36-a7d2-4172-be32-396ba8ed2dd6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4730,"FileName":"3fe39b56-7748-49a3-aa34-b8c68e96d2c5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4730,"AlternateName":"Wiz 'n' Liz: The Frantic Wabbit Wescue","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":4730,"AlternateName":"Wiz 'n' Liz","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":4731,"Name":"Wolfchild","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dr. Kal Morrow, expert in genetic research and creation of human-animal hybrids, has been kidnapped and his family brutally murdered by the terrorist organization CHIMERA.

It was originally created as a ZX Spectrum title for the Yandex Retro Games Battle 2019 where it took third place. Later it was ported to other platforms. It consists of several levels, mostly a single screen with slight scrolling near the edges, where a gold digger needs to collect all the gold bars in the environment to complete the level. As soon as all gold is collected the level ends right away.\n\nEach level represents a room in a mansion, with several platforms, ladders and hazards such as fire. There are enemies moving over the platforms and they are able to use ladders. There are free-roaming flying creatures as well. A single encounter with an enemy or a hazard is immediately deadly and makes the level restart. There are no ways to attack the enemies, they can only be avoided.\n\nA lot of the gameplay revolves around luring the enemies away in a certain direction so you can pass and grab the gold on the other side. There are platforms where it is possible to drop down through them right away. Certain pieces of gold can only be reached through digging. Pickaxes can be picked up in certain levels and they allow the character to dig down once per axe. Other game elements are bridges that can be activated and timed explosions that can be triggered to clear a part of then environment. After a certain number of levels a password is provided.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"RetroSouls","Publisher":"RetroSouls","ReleaseDate":"2020-03-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":178281,"FileName":"eb090693-9fec-472e-a884-764390e46e44.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":178281,"FileName":"2d57c7b9-2a25-47c5-95db-a64315e27362.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":178281,"FileName":"40bf73cf-788d-44ef-9229-36652ae20bad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182657,"Name":"Yie Ar Kung-Fu","ReleaseYear":"2008","Overview":"This is a port of the popular Nintendo Famicom game with slightly better graphics, getting it bit closer to the original Arcade rendition.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Evgeny","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182657,"FileName":"6186411b-5983-4194-80ed-879b2083c4ec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182657,"FileName":"5831e988-1946-4512-a6e0-a4ebe0d40b90.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182657,"FileName":"d683ecf1-bc1a-496e-bd2d-c9d333ef4996.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182657,"FileName":"e113420a-042d-4d99-b20b-568d21407a89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182657,"FileName":"187af90c-db1c-4259-a472-e7f6601a7183.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182657,"FileName":"6a95d8f8-ac14-4d3f-b076-4d0a76abd456.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1533,"Name":"Yogi Bear: Cartoon Capers","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"In this vast multi-level platform game, Yogi is awoken from his winter sleep to discover that work has started on a chemical plant in the heart of Jellystone Park.

Between the two stand the \"middle people\", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or \"middle\" army.\n\nThe player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"58e3279f-a3f0-4ca0-b190-b44104969765.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"91927d54-55d5-4692-8c50-a58d59a28577.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"86a61db1-b910-480e-93f7-0b290f5da9d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"357bd6ce-a895-42b5-8b38-b4beb7fb59f5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"4aecd76f-867a-4733-9414-c7577ced1183.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"43e2bc31-1066-445e-b205-b80971c72c28.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"cf59b0f8-f954-4d7d-8dc9-8fdf5c401b1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20428,"FileName":"123613a4-6dff-48bb-904c-131fd059b6f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4747,"Name":"Zany Golf","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Miniature Golf Turned On Its Head\n\nIt's unbelieve-a-ball!

Despite the horror theme, the game's setting contains humorous elements as well. A two-player cooperative mode is available.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"LucasArts","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"5960383d-6ed4-462e-9e7b-4c322b813ebd.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"50298f85-678b-400b-9df6-69ea3e391db5.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"222354a4-15ce-414f-b591-c2d8c2de57c4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"370b98df-be37-4773-9dd6-bfe5e4388fd3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"2f7b8851-ab5c-4c8b-b02f-80c2875f5297.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"a11b635a-0355-4535-bfcd-b392829a1a75.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"f14485f2-4306-4f29-8f0f-561ac9d74a89.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"565edd1d-c090-4ca7-a117-926d23a72015.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"8e76be93-b24e-447d-aa24-f47cdf9547c2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"fe622a05-1c17-4889-ba0a-fca11a660c3c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"18ce99ca-690d-456d-9033-d952b12e38aa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"95fb0e1a-eb60-4516-8b63-fc8d60656a0e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"a28444fb-2447-4d87-94d5-f81d7ebcb84f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2757,"FileName":"734552e9-fda7-446d-80f7-61da19c74cad.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":2757,"AlternateName":"Zombies","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2757,"AlternateName":"Zombies Ate My Neighbors","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":4750,"Name":"Zool: Ninja of the \"Nth\" Dimension","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"His name is Zool.
