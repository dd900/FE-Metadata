But now, in modern-day Japan, demons called Seeds of Karuma, who worship an ancient evil goddess, began to appear on the Earth, bringing death and destruction. Enno's descendant, a lovely young girl named Chiaki, has no choice but to use her bracelet to summon Zenki! But while being sealed, Zenki has reverted to the form of a nasty, greedy little boy. Chiaki must evoke the power of bracelet to make Zenki fight on her side, and destroy the demons!\n\nVajura Fight is what is commonly called a beat-em-up game, similar to games like Final Fight and others. Controlling either Zenki or Chiaki (or both in two player mode), the player must typically eliminate a number of enemies on a screen until he\/she is allowed to proceed. Zenki fights melee-style, while Chiaki uses ranged energy balls; she can also summon Zenki with the bracelet power-up to inflict massive damage. Zenki and Chiaki can also execute various special attacks, which can be mapped to the controller for quicker access.

There is a variety of ways to manage the girl's life. The player can make a schedule for a whole month, or decide every day what to do. Every action has an effect on the heroine's parameters. For example, just resting every day reduces physical shape and appeal. Working on the manga increases respective skills. It is possible to call friends and spend time with them, or go shopping. There are many items in the game, all of which influence the heroine's stats in that or another way - for example clothes, drawing accessories, books, or even a PC-FX console, that can be bought in an electronics store for about 20000 yen.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-09-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"125147":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data West","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"89e41bcf-9472-4fe7-b9a2-a63d2c114eab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"631c4700-a6a6-4f1b-a6e4-3e8cd23992d9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6fe1aec-964a-4f8d-97ba-5afaed6fbd9b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee7450c2-e19e-4c4a-8571-038376cc1df1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cutey Honey FX","Overview":"The game is based on Go Nagai's manga, that was later made into anime TV series.

To his astonishment, three high school girls arrive and defeat the ruffians. The hero learns that those girls belong to an organization called \"Matoi-Gumi\". Well-trained in martial arts, these girls protect the campus from hooligans and alike. The hero decides to join Matoi-Gumi. Maybe he will save enough girls to make one of them grateful and become his girlfriend!\n\nFire Woman: Matoi-Gumi is an RPG, though not in the traditional sense. There are no supernatural occurrences in the game. Character growth is determined by training, not by fighting enough battles to level up. Learning martial arts, playing basketball, participating in chemistry class - everything has an effect on the hero's parameters. There are no random battles in the game; the fights are story-related and usually occur when the hero attempts to rescue a girl. The battles are turn-based, but have a timer for each turn; before the time runs out, the player has to input a combination of four moves for the hero (including punches, kicks, etc.). \n\nThere is also a \"dating sim\" element in the game. \"Important\" girls can be seen on a special screen called \"GPS\" (\"Gal Positioning System\"). If they are in trouble, they will have sweat on their faces. It is up to the player to decide whether to rescue the girl or not. Sometimes it is possible to become friendly with the girl through other means, such as participating in a club she likes. Walking the girl home increases her affection. By the end of the game, the hero will end up with the girl who likes him most and whom he has spent the most time with. The game has a schedule, keeping track of events such as holidays, girls' birthdays, etc., though the actual game is not real-time - a day ends when the player decides to have the hero go home, or as a conclusion of a story-related event.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"126274":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"First Kiss Story","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HuneX Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0cc62700-09e2-4505-8fc0-24020fcb965c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"60daabbf-dd26-4395-be2a-c55b408922d9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"844ad7a8-adac-4377-a203-1f2c123cbad7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"10ff2f81-5bc1-48ee-9d52-7a40ebbc8d40.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"First Kiss Monogatari","Overview":"Known as the last game originally released for PC-FX, First Kiss Monogatari has the player assume the role of a high school boy (whom the player must name himself), whose parents left town one month before his graduation.

The battles are turn-based but fast-paced, reminding somewhat the Infinity Engine battles from Baldur's Gate series. The participants can freely move on the battle field.

Each Feather protects a gem, and the protector of the Ruby gem is the protagonist of the game - an ordinary high school boy from our modern world who at first wants nothing to do with ancient prophecies and heroic deeds. But as he receives new power from the leader of the Feathers, he understands that his destiny is to fight evil, and perhaps restore Eternal Feather to its former glory.\n\nSparkling Feather is a turn-based strategy game with slight RPG and \"dating sim\" elements. Large-scale battles of the Feathers against demons take place on isometric battle fields. The heroes move on the battle field, attack with weapons when an enemy is in range, and use offensive and healing magic. The party levels up automatically after having won a battle. Between battles, the player can play a roulette-type game, which may allow him to have a date with one of the Feathers (female and male!). During the date the player can choose conversation topics, and depending on his choices the parameters of the companions can increase or decrease.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics","ReleaseDate":"1997-04-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156634":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"40b6fca5-30c9-4601-bbdb-e41ba62b19d7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"249dc92f-18b0-49b0-8783-9b7d7d70cf8f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eafce7d1-ea88-4e45-afc7-67eb3c5dd262.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2bcc5ed1-e93a-4421-9be6-8244deb7a3e9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c6e936a5-d62f-47b9-9fac-cd8d4ff459b7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Power League FX","Overview":"Super Power League FX allows the player to participate in the most prestigious Japanese baseball league, Nippon Professional Baseball.

The PC-FX version of the game also adds an \"omake\" option, where it is possible to view pictures of the girls.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"168597":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HuneX Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1acef027-3067-466a-a6a5-213848ad5502.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d9a44719-b423-446a-bdd6-cb4321bc7383.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"All Japan Women`s Pro Wrestling: Queen of Queens","Overview":"All Japan Women`s Pro Wrestling: Queen of Queens (ÂÖ®Êó•Êú¨Â•≥Â≠ê„Éó„É≠„É¨„Çπ -„ÇØ„Ç£„Éº„É≥ „Ç™„Éñ „ÇØ„Ç£„Éº„É≥„Ç∫-) is a professional wrestling video game released in 1995 on the PC-FX console and developed by NEC Home Electronics.[1] It was released exclusively in Japan as the PC-FX was never sold outside of the country.

By selecting a group of adjoining blocks of the same color, a player may remove them from the screen. Blocks that are no longer supported will fall down, and a column without any blocks will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to one side (often the left). The goal of the game is to remove as many blocks from the playing field as possible.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/104316066"},"176452":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"7cdb1d13-5f31-4312-a8ee-7445f20dc49d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Amateur Teikyou CD-ROM","Overview":"It was bundled with the PC-FXGA.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"177459":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Interchannel","Images":[{"FileName":"5c53c0b6-e703-429d-b5a6-5b2cad057984.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"009099ed-7758-4adf-ae8b-0bf2082b01c7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4257502f-e7b6-4398-aeb2-3f109c7f5bd3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1339902f-d4ea-4a74-9b93-5c5948bea49d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AnimeFreak FX Vol. 2","Overview":"Anime Freak FX Vol. 2 is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by NEC Interchannel, which was released in Japan in 1995.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177460":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Interchannel","Images":[{"FileName":"9965e42f-a5ea-4773-bd2b-f3798ae14a5a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3aadd8cb-76c2-4eca-821a-bd3681b26ab4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56fdbe1e-95ed-4c79-aa2f-f495a8ac7128.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AnimeFreak FX Vol. 3","Overview":"Anime Freak FX Vol. 3 is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by NEC Interchannel, which was released in Japan in 1996.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1996-04-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177461":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Interchannel","Images":[{"FileName":"13d8bdba-1db5-4906-9ac6-964c6f1e3356.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"32c6a9e0-7bd2-49e3-85f2-22d162a99c97.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d763d9b0-a234-43c6-90d0-a8a7dc4892e2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AnimeFreak FX Vol. 4","Overview":"Anime Freak FX Vol. 4 is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by NEC Interchannel, which was released in Japan in 1997.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177462":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Interchannel","Images":[{"FileName":"dbc1eedd-0f58-40d5-916c-afbc6a3bdba4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"905a8d62-84b1-4f09-b392-0a7b58dece62.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AnimeFreak FX Vol. 5","Overview":"Anime Freak FX Vol. 5 is a Miscellaneous game, published by NEC Interchannel, which was released in Japan in 1997.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177463":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Interchannel","Images":[{"FileName":"51dfe036-d4ba-4e46-9951-ac4009f9bd9e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"203da006-6a04-49d6-ac2c-00d83f67d3c7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AnimeFreak FX Vol. 6","Overview":"Anime Freak FX Vol. 6 is a Miscellaneous game, published by NEC Interchannel, which was released in Japan in 1998.","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1998-02-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177464":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"59cb7fcd-5ee3-4249-b6e6-1ad37314fbce.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"441ad28d-0c8a-4b8a-b164-cca4eecee687.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"255f8478-89ab-41f1-a04e-bc1eac688c12.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"PC Engine Fan: Special CD-ROM Vol. 2","Overview":"PCE Fan Special CD-Rom Vol. 2 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by NEC and published by Tokuma Shoten, which was released in Japan in 1996.
