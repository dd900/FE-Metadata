If the timer reaches zero, \"Crazy Trains\" and \"Loop Sweepers\" will appear and race down the track in an attempt to crash into your train. Other obstacles include \"Crazy Tracks\" which can send your train in another direction, and exploding stations (occurring occasionally if the bonus timer reaches zero).\n\nLoco-Motion has 4 play speeds, and offers play for 1 player or 2 players alternating turns.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"3a139fc6-cf6b-4a5c-972c-a35a4a64d133.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"c33a90f1-fcdd-410f-ac0c-3109a14a0ca4.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"e9e6f8c8-793c-4190-978b-16f47c60c560.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"dc2aa4c9-ac04-4efb-afb9-4a33f3a4c450.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"b5902b24-c37f-4c99-9875-832a3300ab1e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"73da1efd-d2f8-4f29-bf6e-4b57112073a8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"a9bb8bb8-0010-467a-bc1b-62e829325562.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146561,"FileName":"26238ba5-61a2-4014-bdb3-81459f46edc6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":146561,"AlternateName":"Gattang Gottong","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":146571,"Name":"Mickey Athletic Land","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Mickey Athletic Land is a Sports game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146571,"FileName":"8a661c41-bfa7-4a7f-b54b-60c0dabcb416.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146571,"FileName":"fd9c48eb-585e-4683-84cc-d6e2b7ee6c74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146572,"Name":"Mission Attack","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Mission Attack is an Action game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146572,"FileName":"7911ae03-e071-4c30-b34d-70a89865727b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146573,"Name":"Monster Inn","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Monster Inn is an Action game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146573,"FileName":"ebae3440-98df-4d6c-a982-b9556ac21d28.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146573,"FileName":"71e79a09-d7d7-4852-bd99-e6243dff5e51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146574,"Name":"Mr. Do!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You need strategy and fast moves to help MR.

To replenish the fuel supply, you must bomb the fuel depots which will appear on the ground occasionally.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"f47b1d54-e006-4720-9655-be5a7a10ca22.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"b43d9699-a762-44d0-8d85-bfef12c9a62c.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"dacb96d6-d99c-44f9-b4c3-884829327694.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"bad08bc2-c2e5-4005-b493-4e898601f2d0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"f9188beb-ffa1-4097-8c13-65e5421f2b72.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"68d05c44-877c-4a1f-8187-0b739fbb82a5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"0eab8df5-32b8-44ad-a988-3f42b5329ce4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146563,"FileName":"eed9f89a-24b5-4219-9a6e-78b283b54446.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":146563,"AlternateName":"Scramble","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":146582,"Name":"Super Bike","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Super Bike is a Sports game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146582,"FileName":"35bbeadd-877d-4979-aaf6-50d152275a40.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146582,"FileName":"f7658dcf-14af-41c1-9bdb-18c51d51e824.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146564,"Name":"Torpedo Terror","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Torpedo Terror is an Action game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"b5c19a9a-6e58-495d-bf79-342afadeccac.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"649d1eb0-bf7f-46b4-8556-ccc3e236b086.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"b6596deb-1f7a-41e2-841d-fc2f87d7d26d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"d3e1bd71-bc2b-4588-b624-0ecbd0180137.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"82468269-e769-4330-8f5d-c4c7e333aac1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"34937bbb-3da5-4246-bb85-3cf12e518f3d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"cad77560-8141-41d9-ae7f-23b827532f3b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146564,"FileName":"2a4766b4-b50b-47b8-ad18-b1f2322c4e51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":146564,"AlternateName":"Bermuda Triangle","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":125126,"Name":"Traffic Jam","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The concept of Traffic Jam shares similarities with titles such as Make Trax and Pac-Man. The player is in control of a car that leaves a blue streak while it drives through a city, viewed from an overhead perspective. The goal is to turn all the black roads into blue. Other cars and roadblocks must be avoided. The other cars can also turn into steamrollers which revert the colors back. The player can use emergency hazards which make his car temporarily invincible and allow to drive into the other vehicles to stun them and receive bonus points. The supply of these hazards can be replenished by driving over oil cans that sometimes appear. There are also letters that spell out\" BONUS\", which can be collected for additional points. Once the entire street grid is turned blue, the next stage begins.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"c3959576-ad36-4aa2-86aa-a301ced30897.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"8026bb5c-08e5-45f8-a573-319c41ec8b60.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"5d233a61-e8b6-4c81-b39a-0aec6715ed8a.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"cb648052-6c72-40a9-9b48-090943b51b1b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"db4d1ede-6dff-4b18-bf4b-cdce5c45cfdb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"1dd4cc0d-1f73-4901-b56e-dfee8aa7868c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"1eab3a46-77a3-4c46-8bfd-38ee3783b820.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"a1b55a52-edf9-4d99-853f-eaa64bc07651.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":125126,"FileName":"063cc67d-e991-44ed-a3c5-35b18cba1161.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":125126,"AlternateName":"Traffic Jam","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":146579,"Name":"Triple Command","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Triple Command is an Action game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146579,"FileName":"fd45bf12-af56-4b73-bd4a-327159beb50f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146579,"FileName":"36b96483-6380-4666-b7cd-4252a7bbeae9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146580,"Name":"Turpin","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Turpin is an Action game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146580,"FileName":"5d77a297-7d3f-437a-92c9-b2023f70b895.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146580,"FileName":"b6642ddc-52d8-43b2-b4df-331a54d0d0ac.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146581,"Name":"Yonin Mahjong","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Yonin Mahjong is a strategy game, developed and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Tomy Tutor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146581,"FileName":"c1700ce2-89ff-492e-a9f2-1333286779eb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
