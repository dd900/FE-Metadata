An elf magician was able to cast a spell to seal the dragon into the depths of a citadel. In the present day an orphan grew up to be a warrior who now wants to become a knight. To prove his ability, he must obtain three treasures from the nearby citadel of the dead\n\nCitadelle is a French language text adventure game where players input noun and verb combinations into a text parser in order to control the protagonist. Players take on the role of the warrior who wants to become a knight. Players move from location to location looking for objects to take or manipulate in order to solve puzzles. Since the warrior can only carry a limited amount of items at a time, the player will have to juggle between which objects to carry around and which ones to leave behind.\n\nAlong the way the warrior will have to fight various enemies such as gnolls, liches, and orcs. During combat players can choose to attack, defend (attacks are less potent for both the warrior and the monster), cast a spell (limited uses), or flee from the fight (brings the warrior back to the previous location). Defeating monsters earns the warrior experience. Players will have to be careful not to take to much damage and lose all their health as the adventure will come to an end.\n\nCitadelle is the first part of a trilogy of games. The first part only contains one of the three treasures needed for knighthood. The ultimate goal of this game is to collect the Shield of Oran and then find out how to descend into the caverns under the citadel.","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"182661":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"74150a1f-c22d-45ec-b59a-cbb3580e3b4d.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6198f23-2cff-4d28-9fe8-62b172aa123b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3014f5ec-da85-4d89-bd36-4f78639b33f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Backgammon","Overview":"A video game conversion of the board game Backgammon.

Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces.

The buildings themselves are separated by a crane holding a scaffolding. Players have to grab the sheets of glass from the scaffolding and place them on each floor one by one. However, there is a vandal located at street level who occasionally hurls a rock to break a sheet of glass that had been added to the building thus slowing down the construction workers job. If the player can get five windows across on a floor or six windows lined up vertically with one on each floor, the glass becomes unbreakable thus thwarting the vandals vandalism.\n\nSince the scaffolding moves to each floor, players have to get to the higher floors of the building by climbing pipes. Once the player takes ten windows from the scaffolding, it goes back down to the street to get a refill of sheets of glass. During this time a cooler filled with soda will randomly appear on a floor which the player can scurry to in order to gain some bonus points before it disappears. The game ends when all the windows get added to the building and the player climbs to the top of the building to receive their final score.\n\nThere is also a two player mode where two players compete against each other to see who can put up all the windows for their building first. Players can slow down their opponents by smashing their windows with a hammer. The gameplay rules of the single player game apply in this mode too. The player who has the highest score at the end wins the match.","Publisher":"Philips Export B.V.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"182663":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"99bb45a1-7823-4629-8149-aeabc4f33f31.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e0c632f1-83e3-4175-abc1-cbc636496a8f.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"64f6bb00-8446-46de-bd06-bc7975d072af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Glouton","Overview":"A top-down maze puzzle game with a concept similar to Pac-Man.

Once a Muncher has been \"munched out\" (term used in the manual), it will return to the center of the maze to recharge for a short time before setting out for revenge once again.\n\nAs players eat more and more munchies, the remaining munchies begin to move faster and faster around the maze.

He is threatening to use these missiles unless his demands are met. While the fortress is impervious from outside attack, it does have a vulnerability. There is a tunnel which leads under the island to the reactor which is being using for power. If someone could enter the tunnel and destroy the reactor, Scarfinger's plans would be ruined, So now, it's up to the player, who takes on the role of a special agent, to put a stop to this. To complete this mission, the intelligence agency is supplying a Spycycle, which is a multipurpose vehicle which can be used as a motorcycle on land, a speedboat on water, and a minisub while underwater.\n\nThe gameplay in La Moto Infernale is divided into three parts. The first part involves players driving a motorcycle along a roadway in order to reach the island. The player has a limited amount of time to complete this task, so they must kick their motorcycle up from the slow first gear all the way up to the blazing fast fifth gear of speed. However, the player may occasionally have to slow down to avoid the barrels and mines clogging up the road. Players also have to be careful not getting to close to either side of the road or risk careening into the mountainside or falling off the road into the water below. Also located on the road are ammo icons which the player should try their best to collect to increase their missile supply.\n\nThe second part involves crossing the sea on the speedboat form of the Spycycle to get to the tunnel entrance. Players will have to dodge mines and mechanical sharks. Also, oil slicks from previously sunken tankers can give the boat engine troubles too. The boat is equipped with a laser rifle and a torpedo launcher to help the player get through this part of the mission. Also, the player will need to collect antimatter bolts from pods which are being dropped from planes. These bolts will be used for destroying the reactor.\n\nThe third part involves entering the tunnel in minisub form. Players will have to dodge neutron bolts being emitted from the reactor and also avoid getting damaged by the shooting gun turrets mounted on the tunnel walls. Finally, when the player reaches the reactor after getting by a gate, they must destroy the core of the reactor.","Publisher":"Philips Export B.V.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"182727":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nice Ideas","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a3adc8f0-fcdb-4b85-acfa-6d137e947c12.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e15e0d9-1c9a-42a2-9f84-c8abbf591de0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"16d245e5-7c84-41cb-9134-5bad316279c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"L'Abeille","Overview":"A bee named Spina is being sent by the queen of the colony to bring pollen back to the hive.\n\nPlayers take control of Spina as the screen constantly scrolls to the right.
