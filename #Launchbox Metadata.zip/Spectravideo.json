When all fires are extinguished, the game progresses to the next floor, where Freddy can climb between the floors, shooting to the left and right instead of upwards. On these levels, there are two kinds of flames â€“ the red and the purple ones. The purple ones are more aggressive, following Freddy around the screen, and can only be put out once all the red ones are extinguished. The game progresses in this way, alternating between the upwards-shooting levels and the sideways-shooting levels.\n\nOn the higher difficulty levels, cats turn up at intervals in the windows, falling down after a while. Freddy must catch the cats, or he will lose a life. Similarly, he loses a life if hit by a fire or falling rubbish.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsWTDLLWCTw","Platform":"Spectravideo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Spectravideo International Ltd.","Publisher":"Spectravideo International Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184055,"FileName":"98884010-8dc1-4caf-8182-40e66ed9a6a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184055,"FileName":"03a84879-528b-473f-a66c-d636fcdb5177.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194246,"Name":"Jumping Jack","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Spectravideo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Spectravideo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194246,"FileName":"54c78af8-5cbb-42fa-8014-15b81042c571.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194246,"FileName":"578cd7d5-edf2-48d9-8b2c-164c24796892.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194247,"Name":"Jungle Jim","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Spectravideo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Spectravideo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194247,"FileName":"911c050f-e760-40c8-be25-cf2ba7e34a5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194247,"FileName":"0b2d02b3-b88a-4045-b186-80fe7dd66bd7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194247,"FileName":"092b421e-c310-4e0c-8fa1-202a5b5638a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194248,"Name":"Juno Lander","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Spectravideo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Sil","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194248,"FileName":"d3b77764-d06c-44f6-bf85-facbfe5bb5eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194248,"FileName":"afa8e665-a110-45ed-84fa-94d8e931acf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194248,"FileName":"7735c3f6-ed07-4c9c-8aaa-e2f40dfaa0fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184056,"Name":"Kung Fu Master","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"In Kung Fu Master the player takes control of Master.

You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them.\n\nThe twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Spectravideo","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mass Tael Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Spectravideo International Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184059,"FileName":"ccdc4ad8-8fc7-473d-a087-dc591f0a1782.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":184059,"FileName":"883a9410-ac8b-4afa-9568-5b15e416f06c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":184059,"FileName":"09369804-e3d6-40a7-adf4-065c49c7d26f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184059,"FileName":"632002aa-9844-4c90-9365-ac4679194d9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194250,"Name":"Sector Alpha","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/LXqoMead7NQ","Platform":"Spectravideo","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Spectravideo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194250,"FileName":"0d8a4ebd-142f-49c2-b9ca-c7ed6f74f072.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184060,"Name":"Spectron","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The planetary clust Shalix is plagued by an intergalactic dust cloud that blocked out their sun.
