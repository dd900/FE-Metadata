It is possible to set the number of rounds in the game, as well as also watch the computer play against itself.","Publisher":"Sachen","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"133981":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Watara","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"bfb7d998-bf44-46e1-a0c6-f6379fd21768.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"224d47c5-32d4-49c6-af7b-80182cb66abc.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"457247e8-1a99-4fd6-b82a-4d0a70df034a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cf25767d-afc8-4fa2-b56a-0b9709d5c799.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cf171050-78bf-4663-8a92-2fbc8fc227a2.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Brain Power","Overview":"Brain Power is a collection of four primarily logic-and-puzzle minigames: \nMine Detector, a clone of Minesweeper\nFortune Four, a version of the board game Qubic, also known as 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe\nCaterpillar, a clone of Snake \nHopper, a version of the board game Peg Solitaire.","Publisher":"Watara","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"133982":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Joy Van","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"6c810b3a-3a9e-4381-9197-17a3eaf787c7.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"13333852-597b-4005-8797-b4566a32a0d0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0e9ef09a-bd87-4bf7-9359-2f1055ea1e7c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"308aa1c8-c269-4037-84b5-7743d03dbf86.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"7aadb768-7239-41f2-88d1-bcce39f0f1b9.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"011d6ae5-4ba1-4dc5-b35c-f55a1dca398e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Galactic Crusader","Overview":"Your starship is alive!
