Its designer Kazutoshi Iida has described it as \"Populous meets Mario\". The player controls the Doshin as he tries to help, or hinder the islands inhabitants. Doing so causes the villagers to release love or hate, which Doshin absorbs. The two feelings cancel each other out, but if he gets enough of one type, he will grow in size. Doshin is the Love Giant, a yellow, featureless giant with a happy face and a few strands of hair. He is a benevolent, helpful being who, with his good actions, earns love from his people and increases in size (only for that day; by the next day, he is back to normal size). He can pick up people trees and other such things. Doshin can transform at will into his evil alter ego Jashin, the Hate Giant. In the GameCube version, he has wings and clawed feet and inspires Hate monuments that are slightly different from the Love monuments Doshin can earn. Jashin is known to be a destructive force to the natives, the exact opposite to Doshin's nature. With his bad actions, people show him their dislike, and he increases in size. The only thing the two giants have in common is that both have an outie belly button. Although he cannot pick up things, he can send streams of fire across the land, destroying structures in their way. Doshin and Jashin can both raise and lower terrain.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doshin_the_Giant"},"107947":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"449b5a16-4528-4785-8351-e9b07215f6c4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d12b6b83-0b0f-400a-a4ad-b03765084cc8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8191ec6e-8db1-4b95-b50e-b31fe5190769.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"adb4acb9-fdd4-4b92-981f-a85f4313567a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7422ec7f-a3ab-4a0f-baf7-b37204ae55aa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"755caacf-5afd-424b-bf39-2b40717ef97e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b7ca3c2d-6ac2-47a8-91d2-67d80b802799.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6085b6ad-8c96-4c23-8798-50b87b12fa67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"5b9f8403-04dc-42ce-a191-6a499880bcae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a7d9eeba-2ac5-496d-85d1-fc390436fdf7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mario Artist: Talent Studio","Overview":"In Mario Artist: Talent Studio, the player can create their own characters in 3D, customizing features such as hair, skin, and eye color, voice, clothes, facial features, and body size and type.

F-Zero X was programmed with \"64DD hooks\", which allow it to detect whether the 64DD is connected and compatible expansion software is loaded. This allows the cartridge-based game to be compatible with expansion disks such as track editors or course updates; however, none of these were utilized outside Japan due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Expansion Kit will only operate in conjunction with the cartridge of the original game. However, all of F-Zero X's regular features are accessible in addition to twelve new tracks, a car editor and a track creator. As the Expansion Kit benefits from a larger amount of storage on disk when compared to the original cartridge version, it includes new soundtracks in stereophonic sound as well as the entire collection of monaural audio tracks from the original game. In addition to the two new cups, it is also possible to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kit's strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2000-04-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6uQv4Aokpfs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/F-Zero_X#Disk_drive_expansion"},"107950":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Nihon Pro Golf Tour 64","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Media Factory","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"551e77e0-f3cc-45f0-8471-4875ba4c749b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0bac951f-4586-429a-82de-31eb16cec2cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04119530-0a15-4efe-94d3-9f5144f40f15.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"183f8b2c-1557-4a3e-8a5a-cc8f0050540a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"13578c87-2f98-4c6d-a262-26b3c301f498.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8799fc43-c76e-4e66-bc10-889ab4b5af12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"cef8afd1-6ce2-419e-b1c9-b71dd5e0b9aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"069b6abe-b625-4f73-82b2-cc71069bf4ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"39fb5fb1-2def-44f8-acdc-4e2756bb97dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Japan Pro Golf Tour 64","Overview":"Japan Pro Golf Tour is an online-enabled golf simulation game developed for the short-lived Nintendo 64 disk drive add-on.
