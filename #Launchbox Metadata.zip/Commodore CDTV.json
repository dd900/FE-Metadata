This ends the level - on to the next one.\n\nAbsorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat.

According to cult programmer Tobias Richter, you view it from the top with all sides displayed, and allow the player to choose the number of sides, from 4 to 25.\n\nA large number of different starting arrangements are offered, grouped by difficulty. Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bjørn Lynne.\n\n\nMagic Serpent:\n\nMagic Serpent is a Snake variant. The player controls a snake called Lenni who has to eat all fruits which are divided over the scrolling level. Said levels are constructed like mazes, i.e. many small gangways. Every time a fruit is eaten, the length of Lenni grows. The player needs to control Lenni (he moves and turns automatically when meeting a wall; the player only needs to intervene when another turn is in order) in a way so he does get in his own way.

In order to free him 20,000 pounds worth of ransom money must be gathered. Of course the nobles of the land aren't willing to give up their wealth, so this money must be obtained through tournaments, raids and outright battle against individual provinces. All of the nobles have castles, so at times siege equipment must be used.\n\nDefender of the Crown II is the sequel to the smash hit Defender of the Crown. It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button. The siege sequence is also enhanced with different types of ammo (such as Greek fire) to toss into the castle. The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sachs Enterprises","Publisher":"Commodore","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"9337c89c-1bb1-4fcc-b9af-388516da228f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"7cea8f02-b40a-4495-a90f-a21ee2855bc5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"4f715caf-3c1b-4419-adcb-97627082fc55.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"a4cc999d-c575-4834-b85b-486847d62627.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"1a25dc53-0d75-404f-8853-dc44dae20651.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"8545a4ec-d55a-44e0-840b-160866225d38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"8910f5af-4816-4772-a150-418586737f1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"72a80411-05d3-4412-a9a0-0f06020527d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":140426,"FileName":"ca1511bd-b3bf-4502-a298-d9de2a43fc5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137944,"Name":"DeLuxe Galaga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137944,"FileName":"ccbfbd6d-3a2f-43f8-96c6-d818b076bf31.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137944,"FileName":"965e524c-ea54-4a4f-ab4b-0d677b9cc66b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137944,"FileName":"1f7756cc-5ca7-453f-8570-625e4fc10f51.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137985,"Name":"Die Stadt der Löwen","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Stadt der Löwen (City of Lions) is a follow-up to the first so-called Artventure game by Phoenics and Software 2000, Holiday Maker.

There is a choice of different ground attack and air-to-air weapons, although these are also limited by several factors. For dogfighting, AIM-9J missiles are not as reliable as newer AIM-9L missiles - and are useless for head-on attack - but were typically the only missiles available. Because they are guided, AGM-65 missiles are easier to use than \"iron dumb bombs\" like the Mk 84, but ineffective against strengthened targets. An ECM pod provides defense against enemy missiles, but occupies an external hardpoint that can be used for additional weapons or fuel. The enemy occupies the western areas of the game's playable map - itself a large square divided into 9 smaller squares. Enemy targets were fixed sites on the ground. For defense, the unnamed enemy was limited to MiG-21 interceptors, and ground-launched missiles - either the SA-2s, which are launched from identified and fixed sites on the ground, or the SA-7s, which could be fired from portable launchers and can therefore appear anywhere.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"MicroProse","Publisher":"Hasbro Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137973,"FileName":"9a4c129b-e8a4-42ad-b6ee-7a74728a776a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137973,"FileName":"d0e39dd2-0429-4b70-91af-ba71977c5039.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137973,"FileName":"c1ae19aa-67ec-4d7e-8534-021845b60aad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137973,"FileName":"68ea3aed-e32e-40fd-ba6a-805ca6eb1ccf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137973,"FileName":"4533828d-0d6b-428d-a8b4-0bd4da8d780d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137973,"FileName":"bfc90dd5-704f-4184-8400-4f4d8abbb547.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137378,"Name":"Fantastic Voyage","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Fantastic Voyage is a side-scrolling shooter based on the 1966 movie of the same name.

You control a girl in a rave outfit who jumps through a series of platform worlds where you throw some love around in the form of hearts, which somehow ties into an environmentally conscious (the packaging was made out of recycled paper) theme where the enemies are representatives of big business. Also, similar to Rainbow Islands, a mass of water is slowly rising from below, so you must hurry upwards through the level. The graphics make the game look not quite like anything else, as though the graphics artist just inverted all the tiles and put them in a random order.\n\nKeeping with the 90s sentiment of \"information wants to be free\", the samples and sprites are kept uncompressed on the disks, for everyone to edit according to their own tastes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I16fVMahk78&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Hex","Publisher":"Hex","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137954,"FileName":"e1cce2dc-2652-4666-9063-c0a7f52b7bec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137954,"FileName":"fa26f60a-0ae0-4c8b-91bf-4271abd12d51.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137954,"FileName":"f6601da0-27ad-44e3-81a5-6606c3c559ca.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137954,"FileName":"3dacd869-1fda-4e9d-837b-12389d5aae0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137954,"FileName":"be3c6279-d524-414c-a085-52e617129f80.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137954,"FileName":"0c66a42a-00ce-46f9-9722-d2523ba18482.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137955,"Name":"Guy Spy and the Crystals of Armageddon","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Guy Spy is quite easily one of the most eagerly awaited games of the year. From its initiation early on in January, and our special In Development article six months ago, interest has snowballed – the question on everyone’s lips was: can real gameplay be added to Readysoft’s stunning cartoon-quality graphics? Now, more than eighteen months on, the finished product is poised to hit the shelves and revolutionize the world of interactive gaming.\n\nGuy Spy is presented as a cartoon adventure in much the same way as the Dragon’s Lair series before it. In fact, the whole thing has been produced in more or less the same vein as Space Ace but features longer, more playable sections, with the player actually controlling Guy rather than guiding him when necessary. The term ‘Interactive’ when used to describe Guy Spy is still slightly misleading, though, as it’s more interactive than most games. Although you do exercise control over the character, it’s still never more than walk left, step right, punch or whatever.\n\nOf the thirteen levels it’s fair to say that most are enjoyable, but there’s only a handful you’ll want to play again. The best levels have been sensibly placed sporadically to keep the interest up, though, and there are enough of them to keep you coming back for more. Couple these with the fine and other humorous link animations and three difficulty settings, and the game goes a long way to restore credibility to Readysoft gaming.\n\nThis is the closest anyone has come to a fully animated and playable adventure and the Canadian-base company deserve enormous credit. It’s still not the perfect cartoon-quality game, but I seriously doubt whether a floppy-based Amiga would ever be able to house such a project anyway. That said, though, what Readysoft have achieved here is admirable and it’s a hefty step in the right direction and one that deserves praise. It’s by no means perfect, but give it a whirl regardless.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"ReadySoft Incorporated","Publisher":"ReadySoft Incorporated","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"d8146b24-925c-438a-8468-721db9bad20f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"0dff521e-e065-425f-bbbd-bf343397e35f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"ee1f8661-e5bc-44ff-a566-191efb8885ab.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"c3ebe14b-0ab6-4189-b94f-253288c18607.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"83883074-0fb0-4dff-8192-9c72a9521255.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"c41d12cf-6224-4a46-a774-fed33390fc38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137955,"FileName":"fa6de19d-2e70-4d74-9bad-8aa467c2062d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190340,"Name":"Heroic Age of Spaceflight: NASA...

The player is presented with a top-down level with differently coloured blocks. Those blocks can be moved in any direction, but they automatically move into the chosen direction until they meet an obstacle, e.g. a wall or another block. In contrast to Atomix, the goal is not to create a shape but to vaporize all blocks with the usual tile-matching method: two or more blocks of the same colour disappear when they touch. Each level has to be solved within a certain time frame and a limited amount of bombs can be used to kill off single blocks.\n\nMultiplayer is always turn-based, but there is a choice if the turns are inside the level (i.e. the first player moves one block, then the second the next block and so on) or outside (i.e. the first player solves the level and then the second player gets a shot at it).\n\nLettrix is a puzzle game in which the player gets presented with a structure, e.g. a big \"A\". This needs to be rebuilt by using eight differently formed blocks (some reminiscent of Tetris shapes) which can be rotated and placed on the playfield. Those blocks are limited in number, e.g. the player may have ten of one and six of another available to use. Wrongly placed blocks can be picked up again, but the player fights against a time limit. When playing with two players, they work together at the same puzzle and alternate their moves.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNoL9KPqE-4&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Software 2000","Publisher":"Software 2000","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"6ce40e4b-3508-46a2-811c-9bd43e59c5c5.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"8fe65ab5-ce0c-4030-8616-2e16d78cb641.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"03bbf324-860b-4eb0-87f9-b4bc8eb43aa1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"84d68114-6a38-4597-b8f0-17befc011c0c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"555d8a8d-5944-44ca-8a6b-f1ffeb3d1077.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"e1b1a70e-fccb-4295-a6b3-f1af69f50602.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"9f94490c-7271-4bca-8291-599966e34253.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":138023,"FileName":"37a6165e-3785-4fc0-a28c-2cd2046963e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Germany"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138053,"Name":"Sim City","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"SimCity, later renamed SimCity Classic, is a city-building simulation video game, first released on February 2, 1989, and designed by Will Wright for the Macintosh computer.

The player needs to remove all stones on a board by finding a counterpart. Only two stones with the same symbol can be removed at a time and they have to be on a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The game starts with Scarab on an ankh and that item has to be returned upon completion. Moving a stone is done by sitting on one and moving it towards the counterpart. Not all stones can be moved however and there are teleporters, obstructions and diversions to make it more difficult. There are also traps and for instance ice that forces Scarab to move in a single direction. When the stones are aligned, pressing fire matches them and they disappear.\n\nThe game can be played in a Logic or in an Arcade mode. Logic mode offers 100 levels with no time limit. Special stones can make the player’s life easier or harder. In Arcade mode the player has to complete a level within a certain amount of time. Special coins can be used to buy extras after each level, such as ability to fly for 30 seconds, more time, extra lives and others. Levels are generated at random. The Arcade mode has a high score table. Demo mode shows the usage of all the different stones found in the game. This is a sort of non-playable tutorial.

Using the arrow keys move the pointer onto the word \"Tutorial\" and press button 'A' to discover just about everything you ever wanted to know about \"The Town With No Name\" but were too afraid to ask!\n\nWay out west, there are places you shouldn't go, people you shouldn't mess with, and meals that'll ventilate your britches. So, when the Man With No Horse rode into town and shot Evil Eb's littlest brother, it could only mean one thing; That Mr Diablo's Undertakin' Emporium (\"Flexible Credit Terms Available - Die now, pay later\") was going to be busy!\n\n“The Town With No Name\" takes the multimedia experience another step forward with this vast interactive cartoon feature. Play your part as the story unfolds around you. but remember, the Hole In The Head Gang don't take prisoners!\n\nThe Town with No Name was a game released for the Amiga CDTV, developed by Delta 4 Interactive and published by Sierra On-Line.\n\n\nThe Man With No Name enters The Town with No Name via The Town with A Train to start the Console with No Game. He meets many odd characters in town, like the bartender, the year-long hooker, Abraham Lincoln, and Death himself. Our protagonist also can defeat evil outlaws like Evil Eb, Wildcard McVee, and Nasty Ned. If you kill enough of his minions, Eb will plead forgiveness and eventually befriends you. You can also go back on the train and fly to outer space, but that isn't the proper ending.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8CYhfsbX48","Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Delta 4 Interactive","Publisher":"On-Line Entertainment Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"ce85e363-ddec-4132-979b-48ac1ed50e4b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"af18f660-15b7-4dcc-a98d-93306d1c40b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"582afe26-5f0e-49d6-af73-63950824e752.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"8557cf81-30f9-46d2-b631-57c9074a1dcd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"6109fc55-1bd0-43fa-8154-84795ef6c47e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"92c09923-7638-414f-8364-2deb217dfe41.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"66244fe6-6771-4c65-8bca-7ff18255dda2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137989,"FileName":"bf4c1991-6bb4-4756-ba7e-af72e75e6630.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":137989,"AlternateName":"The Town With No Name","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":137990,"Name":"Trivial Pursuit: The CDTV Edition","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.\n\nTwo game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.\n\nOne additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.","MaxPlayers":"6","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore CDTV","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"The Kremlin","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137990,"FileName":"f8bc443e-63f0-447f-a12d-0e891fd20c7c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137990,"FileName":"95af39ef-a0d0-48c5-a817-9e108506637c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137990,"FileName":"c4a4ec31-1391-4070-ab96-7f9f28342d03.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137990,"FileName":"433f6ec3-e2e9-49a5-a8f1-b77e3f6b5e5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":137990,"FileName":"079ea6f2-fc26-4cd3-baa5-8d572ea4ac18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137991,"Name":"Turrican","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Turrican is a 1990 video game programmed and designed by Manfred Trenz.
