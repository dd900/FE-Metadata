Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.\n\nAbsorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat.

Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bjørn Lynne.\n\n\nMagic Serpent:\n\nMagic Serpent is a Snake variant. The player controls a snake called Lenni who has to eat all fruits which are divided over the scrolling level. Said levels are constructed like mazes, i.e. many small gangways. Every time a fruit is eaten, the length of Lenni grows. The player needs to control Lenni (he moves and turns automatically when meeting a wall; the player only needs to intervene when another turn is in order) in a way so he does get in his own way. Each level has to be completed within 60 seconds, but collecting clocks extends this limit. Other power-ups are rabbits (make Lenni faster) , snails (make Lenni slower, but no slower than the default speed), axes (the length of Lenni gets cut back to the starting value) and teleports to the starting point of the level. Each power-up also effects the points.","Publisher":"Software 2000","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"137941":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"92185b90-20b3-4c9c-a851-c0a749954064.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1cac4bcb-5c33-4731-bd42-7eb939a50057.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5fb445a5-bef9-44bf-a853-f711726509e1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0a3ab3f0-dd4e-4e83-9675-b7e61c260b0f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"79af21a4-dd4e-4c80-a9b6-0bfa89ae668e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7bb6e335-7866-4b3f-822b-da4a6f944c8d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"A Bun for Barney","Overview":"Barney the bear had a bun, but all his friends wanted to eat it, this is the story of how he learned to say no.","Publisher":"BBC Multimedia","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"137942":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MMMGroup","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"21891fc8-38af-4677-81a8-9222d9829b41.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8a708389-d5e1-4f11-a97d-956cf4742636.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"85f70d87-dd08-4ada-a482-7b7a7dd06740.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5722c3d0-0a81-4568-bddd-cd8dadeab047.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c5b42291-cacd-4f93-a092-e9518ecc1e90.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8a78ae69-9ffa-4ad6-9fb0-534ac48bf326.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Camel Racer","Overview":"Multi Media Medium is bringing a new concept to the Kwizoke - In House Entertainment System.

There are also traps and for instance ice that forces Scarab to move in a single direction.

Special stones can make the player’s life easier or harder. In Arcade mode the player has to complete a level within a certain amount of time. Special coins can be used to buy extras after each level, such as ability to fly for 30 seconds, more time, extra lives and others. Levels are generated at random.

With members from the experimental sampling music group Coldcut in the development team, it aimed to look no worse than a contemporary MTV video, with a cool rave intro, crazy \"sampled\" graphics composed of random imagery and lots of aaaciiiiiid.\n\nWhat it all boils down to is a very simple platform game with very advanced graphics. You control a girl in a rave outfit who jumps through a series of platform worlds where you throw some love around in the form of hearts, which somehow ties into an environmentally conscious (the packaging was made out of recycled paper) theme where the enemies are representatives of big business. Also, similar to Rainbow Islands, a mass of water is slowly rising from below, so you must hurry upwards through the level. The graphics make the game look not quite like anything else, as though the graphics artist just inverted all the tiles and put them in a random order.\n\nKeeping with the 90s sentiment of \"information wants to be free\", the samples and sprites are kept uncompressed on the disks, for everyone to edit according to their own tastes.","Publisher":"Hex","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I16fVMahk78&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase"},"137955":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ReadySoft Incorporated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d8146b24-925c-438a-8468-721db9bad20f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0dff521e-e065-425f-bbbd-bf343397e35f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ee1f8661-e5bc-44ff-a566-191efb8885ab.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3ebe14b-0ab6-4189-b94f-253288c18607.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"83883074-0fb0-4dff-8192-9c72a9521255.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c41d12cf-6224-4a46-a774-fed33390fc38.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fa6de19d-2e70-4d74-9bad-8aa467c2062d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Guy Spy and the Crystals of Armageddon","Overview":"Guy Spy is quite easily one of the most eagerly awaited games of the year. From its initiation early on in January, and our special In Development article six months ago, interest has snowballed – the question on everyone’s lips was: can real gameplay be added to Readysoft’s stunning cartoon-quality graphics? Now, more than eighteen months on, the finished product is poised to hit the shelves and revolutionize the world of interactive gaming.\n\nGuy Spy is presented as a cartoon adventure in much the same way as the Dragon’s Lair series before it. In fact, the whole thing has been produced in more or less the same vein as Space Ace but features longer, more playable sections, with the player actually controlling Guy rather than guiding him when necessary. The term ‘Interactive’ when used to describe Guy Spy is still slightly misleading, though, as it’s more interactive than most games. Although you do exercise control over the character, it’s still never more than walk left, step right, punch or whatever.\n\nOf the thirteen levels it’s fair to say that most are enjoyable, but there’s only a handful you’ll want to play again. The best levels have been sensibly placed sporadically to keep the interest up, though, and there are enough of them to keep you coming back for more. Couple these with the fine and other humorous link animations and three difficulty settings, and the game goes a long way to restore credibility to Readysoft gaming.\n\nThis is the closest anyone has come to a fully animated and playable adventure and the Canadian-base company deserve enormous credit. It’s still not the perfect cartoon-quality game, but I seriously doubt whether a floppy-based Amiga would ever be able to house such a project anyway. That said, though, what Readysoft have achieved here is admirable and it’s a hefty step in the right direction and one that deserves praise. It’s by no means perfect, but give it a whirl regardless.","Publisher":"ReadySoft Incorporated","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guy_Spy_and_the_Crystals_of_Armageddon"},"137956":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PM Entertainment","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"fc4e36f9-2b8b-49a7-b8a7-73e968c982d7.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"ad06afd0-0d7a-4546-881b-70c6e83a748f.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b5ddeed1-62b6-4d3d-84fa-32a62ac0a8ce.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"308bd014-dbc6-4f42-9815-ce8739c3fa89.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7ef97938-ee26-4c65-a335-b0033aeac577.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"97c85320-637b-4efc-951e-f0dcfd8430ca.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7fe0afc8-9777-4a85-8670-04637203c693.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"72f05c83-bfbb-45b4-b565-81939a55df95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Holiday Maker","Overview":"The first of Phoenics' and Software 2000 Artventures series, Holiday Maker tells the story of four young people who decided to spend their vacation on an uninhabited island.

Rowan Software ported Falcon for Spectrum HoloByte to the Atari ST in 1988 and Amiga in 1989, and the version for the CDTV was also published by Spectrum HoloByteand Mirrorsoft in 1992.\n\nIn the original Falcon, the players have their choice of flying one of 12 missions - with awards for flying missions at higher skill levels. There is a choice of different ground attack and air-to-air weapons, although these are also limited by several factors. For dogfighting, AIM-9J missiles are not as reliable as newer AIM-9L missiles - and are useless for head-on attack - but were typically the only missiles available. Because they are guided, AGM-65 missiles are easier to use than \"iron dumb bombs\" like the Mk 84, but ineffective against strengthened targets. An ECM pod provides defense against enemy missiles, but occupies an external hardpoint that can be used for additional weapons or fuel. The enemy occupies the western areas of the game's playable map - itself a large square divided into 9 smaller squares. Enemy targets were fixed sites on the ground. For defense, the unnamed enemy was limited to MiG-21 interceptors, and ground-launched missiles - either the SA-2s, which are launched from identified and fixed sites on the ground, or the SA-7s, which could be fired from portable launchers and can therefore appear anywhere.","Publisher":"Hasbro Interactive","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Falcon_(video_game)"},"137974":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e6968f91-4988-4988-956f-257b8247054b.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e5645dab-054f-4031-8467-f80bd1886c52.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36840cf8-989e-4863-a1cf-d7a5b711b5bb.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"11b770fb-1e02-476e-9b63-9acc39c293fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bd118b85-443c-4fa0-bbea-3b215415f847.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7eca0917-2aa4-4a78-a27c-e924552d6d41.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c13a71a0-560a-40cd-8fd4-19a0e3699dd4.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","Overview":"It is 1938 and adventurer Indiana Jones is joined by his father on this quest, preventing Adolf Hitler from capturing the Holy Grail.

Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.\n\nTwo game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.\n\nOne additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"137991":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rainbow Arts","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d8710fb0-d7b8-46c7-b26e-fc15d52281dc.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1c130b71-e277-45ba-b619-e17d3f6845ab.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"69659477-90bf-4ea7-a596-1330fae725f4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"de72c38d-5a61-4008-8a14-4fbcb85cabe2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c3efd9ea-0cab-4cc8-b2d7-a51fc557310d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"98a327f8-4668-43a2-b9d2-1ce028e8b963.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"feef9e1d-705b-4cba-8e93-a35aec7f941b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7a618af8-3b62-49e9-b899-eb1fc592b24f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Turrican","Overview":"Turrican is a 1990 video game programmed and designed by Manfred Trenz.

The player is presented with a top-down level with differently coloured blocks. Those blocks can be moved in any direction, but they automatically move into the chosen direction until they meet an obstacle, e.g. a wall or another block. In contrast to Atomix, the goal is not to create a shape but to vaporize all blocks with the usual tile-matching method: two or more blocks of the same colour disappear when they touch. Each level has to be solved within a certain time frame and a limited amount of bombs can be used to kill off single blocks.\n\nMultiplayer is always turn-based, but there is a choice if the turns are inside the level (i.e. the first player moves one block, then the second the next block and so on) or outside (i.e. the first player solves the level and then the second player gets a shot at it).\n\nLettrix is a puzzle game in which the player gets presented with a structure, e.g. a big \"A\". This needs to be rebuilt by using eight differently formed blocks (some reminiscent of Tetris shapes) which can be rotated and placed on the playfield. Those blocks are limited in number, e.g. the player may have ten of one and six of another available to use. Wrongly placed blocks can be picked up again, but the player fights against a time limit. When playing with two players, they work together at the same puzzle and alternate their moves.","Publisher":"Software 2000","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TNoL9KPqE-4&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase"},"138024":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Starbyte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b000bba4-1b53-497f-9b4b-b2ff91d9f63b.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d1bbb07e-17d4-43ac-b05d-979848addef1.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bd31388b-2471-4e56-9ba6-359567661ecc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"672c2439-a87e-4a77-9c98-c1ae266d5d20.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0d3d5c57-8206-4106-8b07-60f0b177b259.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"695d0701-a34d-4bd0-9186-bc63dbfae63c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1d7c3a1f-ac82-42c2-a310-d44a9b74947e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tie Break","Overview":"This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective.

In order to free him 20,000 pounds worth of ransom money must be gathered. Of course the nobles of the land aren't willing to give up their wealth, so this money must be obtained through tournaments, raids and outright battle against individual provinces. All of the nobles have castles, so at times siege equipment must be used.\n\nDefender of the Crown II is the sequel to the smash hit Defender of the Crown. It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button. The siege sequence is also enhanced with different types of ammo (such as Greek fire) to toss into the castle. The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.","Publisher":"Commodore","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Defender_of_the_Crown"},"140427":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Attention to Detail","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ebc12077-6a69-43ad-a244-daf0da7b0796.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2b298177-42eb-41fd-bee7-75ad156e92bd.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bb95ce9c-a014-4016-b570-8dc711d24052.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dd697ec3-2705-48e8-a253-90e80f325750.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f38bb3c0-7dc4-4eb9-b83a-9314d2b70f5d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7462962e-15e7-4a2d-a165-bf908e48d9a0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis","Overview":"Indiana Jones follows an ancient medallion around the world to discover the secret of Atlantis before the Nazis can wield its terrible power in this classic LucasArts point-and-click adventure.\n\nIt was never officially released on the Commodore CDTV.","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Fate_of_Atlantis"},"140428":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Créalude","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"0f15714f-3598-4ad5-8ff1-448105c37a97.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"48829beb-dba3-482b-872c-22a946fd8a62.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d61399ef-4cb9-4986-b7bf-7a6dab5521f9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0fa05823-b89c-4981-9d86-8dbc5232858f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"23687f4d-aeb2-4954-9ce6-b4c6ca27041f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8b37f6c3-c620-4248-8d66-589d697a1780.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5811a90d-ff17-480c-86de-0d7bd1c91314.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mind Run","Overview":"Mind Run is a mental training game that is made up of a number of tests that are divided into four different categories:\n\nMemory: A number of objects are shown on the screen and after the press of a button changes are made.
