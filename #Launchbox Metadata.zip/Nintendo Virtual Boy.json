V-Tetorisu?) is Japanese-exclusive. It is not to be confused with the similar Virtual Boy title 3D Tetris, as the two games are entirely different. V-Tetris is mostly the same as the original Tetris games, the only difference being the cylindrical puzzle mode in which blocks could be placed in a 3-D spiral. By using the L and R buttons, or the right D-pad, the screen shifts a block left or right respectively.","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software","ReleaseDate":"1995-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Tetris_variants"},"19242":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Athena","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b05c39f1-306b-4d65-9345-2c0b8c114f44.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fc4abe25-8eb6-44c3-ad38-f89b5980b13b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a79ec661-edd4-4cbe-84c2-64b8d07596d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7fefc17b-da54-4060-987d-e213a653bb1b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4ce8f3bc-3f22-4b37-880a-48fa8238f49d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2514ada3-19c4-4051-a991-ee89cb69ee9b.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"597633ab-fec7-41d7-8e1d-aa9e9593d11e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"01f61747-1595-4577-9280-580b7547df62.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bb5e5393-253f-4a4e-a78c-aa8bfed2014c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Virtual Bowling","Overview":"Virtual Bowling is a Sports game, developed and published by Athena, which was released in Japan in 1995.","Publisher":"Athena","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Virtual_Boy_games"},"19243":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Locomotive Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"51f80b09-e45b-4896-8a2b-d10092aef882.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6ac3c9a8-498e-4403-a817-4d3f7a20c273.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a86d7738-78ad-4153-84e4-bad767d84712.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"565304b5-d027-480c-91bc-dbcc5aa133b5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9d0198a-5dd8-4b43-b01c-6704c70e7932.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9afc0e02-5a62-403f-aa83-0966221c0d93.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d63a8c8e-b53f-4904-ab8e-fe9d27a95ec7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d315b8f1-8ff8-4c82-9cf2-07372342e143.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4565dc2e-6968-4bc7-9f66-81716a692750.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Virtual Fishing","Overview":"Virtual Fishing is a Sports game, developed by Locomotive Corporation and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1995.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19244":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nacoty","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"9ddaf49c-0d7d-4f69-8eb9-f00330128667.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c5a70f61-8a94-4e74-941d-0a9bd14c10f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"582104ac-0c38-4d47-a221-1f0714d7e522.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c36b92f2-74ed-42f5-9da7-392cf99f2a7f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"971221a2-9a94-40ca-91d8-23725d606c7f.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"78b5a8c1-2ea5-4d97-911e-8978ab1a4b29.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"01b6d834-dc9c-4544-80e5-3676a5c126e2.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c23e6f17-dc7e-4601-b42b-088322616fa0.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Virtual Lab","Overview":"Virtual Lab is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by J-Wing, which was released in Japan in 1995.","Publisher":"J-Wing","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Virtual_Boy_games"},"20556":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Japan System Supply","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"450cd2b2-021a-44f4-a648-71a9fedd278b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce332ac8-5a7e-473f-8251-a100bb1aa6ee.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7f17e239-f6b6-4505-b2fc-443a8a134809.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"de087ef5-0001-4bef-bf89-9d4ea73aa0c6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cf9b73e7-5ddb-4c2d-968c-146741676292.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bound High!","Overview":"Originally developed by Japan System Supply, Nintendo liked the game idea of Bound High! and took over the project later. The game was, besides Dragon Hopper, going to be one of the games, which should have saved the system with a relaunch, but it was delayed again and again until it was cancelled because of the lack of success of the Virtual Boy. At this time, the game already was completely finished.\n\nIn Bound High!, Chalvo, the bouncing robot, travels through space In full 3d-D motion in pursuit of alien invaders that threaten the peaceful inhabitants of Earth. Angling from above, players control rolled up Chalvo, who must destroy all enemies on the playfield by landing on them and throwing them down from the playfield. Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life.\nThe playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric \"shockers\" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air.\nSometimes blocks lead to an \"Another Stage\", some kind of mirrored parallel universe with inverted colors and without the dangerous winds.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Virtual_Boy_games"},"26772":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"NikoChan Battle","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullet-Proof Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0f0f0461-f94a-457c-af10-31f0d5ebcc9a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c2eff577-56b4-413a-b21d-4326919eacfa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ea0b419-e736-4f1a-a751-9309c92caae8.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0e51d869-f74c-4c43-b296-185b44a6fce4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"99ed708c-e06e-4fe5-99ec-1763866e54ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"55bc8ee8-4dc4-4e8c-b2e9-076f96d5861a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Faceball","Overview":"Faceball was going to be one of the games to support the unreleased Virtual Boy GameLink cable.
