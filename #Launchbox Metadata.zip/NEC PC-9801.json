The first is a side-scrolling arcade sequence during which the player has to prevent the girl from reaching her house, and avoid the hazards on the protagonist's way. These include stones, barriers, animals such as dogs and turtles, etc., and can be avoided by destroying or jumping over them. The protagonist runs automatically, but the player can increase or decrease the distance between him and the running girl. In order to make the girl choose the wrong way and fail to find her house, the protagonist throws stones at her (these can also be used to kill animals and destroy obstacles). After the protagonist has caught the girl, the game switches into sex simulation. The player pushes arrow keys in a specific order to correspond with the protagonist's movements. The goal is to sexually satisfy the girl. If the player fails, the protagonist is arrested; if he succeeds, the girl marries the protagonist.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Macadamia","Publisher":"Macadamia","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197560,"FileName":"f24f4cca-72e6-4f6b-b26a-0d079e965d76.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197910,"Name":"2 Shot Diary","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"2 Shot Diary is a collection of twelve short episodes of sexual nature, each told by a different young woman, presented as entries in their diaries.

There is a greater number of selectable characters and specific vehicle requirements (types of planes, helicopters, etc.) for certain missions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv805SM4Zyg","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1996-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183408,"FileName":"47e92701-10d4-4fe7-87ea-1bc2a5b0fe25.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183408,"FileName":"ea9eb176-60ca-43b8-9fdb-e508e5db54f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183408,"FileName":"cc0fb568-9d1b-40bd-b49a-16ecf2e05590.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183408,"FileName":"4b685ece-f1c8-44fc-a5c5-1000823724e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183408,"FileName":"1956a7da-a6eb-4a5d-89b4-9543f918d6dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187675,"Name":"Adventureland","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Adventureland is an update to the text-only Adventureland from 1978.

Since he is a super-hero, his main concern is to save people - most importantly, women. For Mr. M, \"saving\" is synonymous with \"sexually satisfying\". There are beautiful women on remote planets that have not experienced the joy of true sexual satisfaction. Only one man can save them - Mr. M's friend, the famous Space Gigolo, Red Cobra, the one who \"lives and dies for love and justice\"! And he has just the right tool - an intelligent sex toy named Pakki! But alas, not all is simple: the sexy, but deadly intergalactic warrior Mangoose and her minions will do everything possible to stop Red Cobra! Be vigilant, hero!\n\nUsually just called Red Cobra, this game is yet another Illusion-made genre experiment. This time, we are talking about space shooter with sex. The player controls Red Cobra's spaceship in a pseudo-3D scrolling environment. The gameplay is what one would expect from a space shooter: shoot everything, avoid enemy blows, grab the power-ups, beat a boss, finish the stage. Everything is controlled with the mouse: moving it moves the ship on screen, holding the left button fires at enemies. There are three selectable difficulty levels.\n\nThe game also has extensive, story-heavy cut-scenes between the shooting levels, with plenty of dialogue and - naturally - sex scenes. The sex scenes in this game are quite mild (especially for Illusion) and mostly involve women \"rescued\" by Red Cobra using the sex toy Pakki for... well, what sex toys are usually used for. Some of these scenes are animated.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Illusion","Publisher":"Illusion","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"ff143b93-08d8-4331-b5b2-cfb055bef396.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"daf1d358-1717-4c42-a679-7d5e93596c5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"74775106-1c11-44b2-886e-5b61b4c8817d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"c063b6d7-526d-410b-9cc5-cfc8883cb9bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"f4f4c2e8-9cb0-4ae6-9c0e-a437fdb3ce3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"748f34b6-a2c1-48ce-a443-b16456999f18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187677,"FileName":"1d9ac44e-2541-4673-a886-668c3a871ee5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187032,"Name":"Ai Shimai: Futari no Kajitsu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Takehito Nogawa is a young boy whose father is a wealthy businessman, owner of a powerful corporation.

Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.\n\nCarnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).\n\nNow Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead.\n\nAlone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery.\n\nApart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders.

Her latest project is a spaghetti western being filmed in an abandoned western ghost town called Slaughter Gultch, which rests precariously on the edge of the San Andreas fault. Originally a gold town set up rather rudely on ancient Indian sacred ground, Slaughter Gultch was founded by a man named Jebediah Stone and run by his own private army of cold-blooded killers. Stone and his men were killed by angry villagers led by the local Blacksmith, and the town was abandoned soon after. Unfortunately, Emily's crew disturbs the spirits of Stone and his men, who promptly return to the world of the living and proceed to kill off the film crew one by one.\n\nCarnby is called to Slaughter Gultch after learning of the disappearance of Emily and her crew, and is soon met by Stone's Zombie Cowboy gang. Armed with various western paraphenalia such as colt peacemakers, bullwhips, and even a gatling gun, Carnby must fight his way through Stone's minions and discover Emily's fate. Along the way he learns some surprising things about Stone's origin, as well as a sinister plan interrupted by his death which involved the destruction of the west coast and which Stone can now pursue once again.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the two predecessors: The player guides Carnby through static 3D screens which regularly switch camera perspectives. He collects various items and uses them to solve puzzles. Additionally to using items there are four actions which are triggered with the press of a button: jump (only at pre-defined places), open/examine, move (e.g. pushing) and fight. The latter is an important gameplay mechanics because many situations require a violent approach: the player either uses melee attacks or other weapons (with scarce ammo resources). The player has to aim manually and can set Carnby's and the enemy's life energy (which greatly affects the difficulty) in three steps.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Infogrames","Publisher":"AMT Savan","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189554,"FileName":"cc36a010-755f-41ca-9c87-5ad113fa54cd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189554,"FileName":"1c67211c-ca9f-4a64-9eb7-159b57e4f04c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189554,"FileName":"7df8c4ab-19b6-4c58-adbf-979b9524f07c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189554,"FileName":"a9f95d02-c9c5-4a6a-aa56-cd0f2a909af2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183512,"Name":"Alpha","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Alpha is an early game by Square, that had started its existence as a developer of Japanese-only text adventures before it became famous for its Final Fantasy series.

The party receives only gold and no experience points from battles. There are no weapons and/or armor that the characters are able to equip; money can only be spent on healing items.

Conveniently, commands that do not lead to a new text message any more are removed from the menu, so that the player can concentrate on the others.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Basement","Publisher":"Basement","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182408,"FileName":"a00c6feb-2bee-4f7d-9344-15e629b06097.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182408,"FileName":"6d321986-b698-4e85-9932-f96da89b1d3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182408,"FileName":"0e7b4087-88f8-41e9-8d58-09deb050a986.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182408,"FileName":"1d212f62-2194-4889-94fd-52195f4a79a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182408,"FileName":"30062398-ee72-459c-84ed-0ce2efa5da5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184568,"Name":"Arquelphos","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Arquelphos is a Strategy game, developed and published by D.O., which was released in Japan in 1993","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"D.O.

The game has different speed/time settings (slower to faster), hence the player may manage strategies while remaining in real-time mode. As its predecessor, the game comes with different difficulty settings, symbolized by several famous naval commanders and also comes with a game editor.\n\nShip Types\nAs its predecessor, the game introduces three different types of units in the game:\n\n    The frigate, small but fastest ship in the fleet.\n    The ship-of-the-line, the primary battleship in the fleet.\n    The flagship, well armed but slow. Flagships are the moving strategic flags that need to be captured in order to win the game.\n\nThe aim of the game is to capture all the enemy flagships while protecting flagships under the player's control. As added difficulty, new ships cannot be built, however enemy ships may be captured by boarding them.\n\nMain Map\nThe main map provides information regarding friendly and enemy unit location, ports, and certain waters that may cause damage to ships that cross it. Reparations and supplies may be obtained in the many ports provided on the main map. Whether or not supplies or reparations may take place depend on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCertain types of waters may be dangerous for ships to sail across. There are two different types of waters: shallow waters and dangerous waters. The larger the ship, usually the more damage they take when they cross those seas. This however also depends on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCombat\nSea combat enters a top down tactical map, where the player can control several ships at once. During sea combat, the aim of the game is to sink the opposing fleet by firing cannons or by boarding and capturing the ship.\n\nWhen to ships collide with each other, the combat screen enters the boarding screen. There are two different units provided when boarding: swordsmen (pirates with cutlasses, for melee) and musketeers (ranged combat). The winner is the last man standing. Certain ports provide different type of pirate units, however this is not explicitly mentioned within the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Evryware","Publisher":"Broderbund Japan","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"632cb50e-b76a-4374-9feb-e320a9355935.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"214dfede-f338-4bb3-b128-2715014a971c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"0a1baec3-0eb9-41c7-87ea-a86d96885eef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"c09538f3-7249-4be9-ac2b-a0c8482fa896.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"2ac0f8ce-9c5f-43e7-925c-869168619787.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"14703795-6cd8-488b-85b4-a840ed6486c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"52975049-540c-461a-ae2f-bb2a728db903.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189818,"FileName":"56205f73-61e4-4fd2-bc68-5e5fb67b1a6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187047,"Name":"Artemis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Two young warriors, Notos and Ing, were traveling in a faraway country, when suddenly a giant woman-snake appeared in front of them.

Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject.\n\nSim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems.\n\nContrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success.\n\nBalance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation; Education","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Acclaim Japan, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187061,"FileName":"dbe0714a-d15e-4c63-95d5-2cb036b0e304.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187061,"FileName":"799ece13-cf11-4992-ab5d-5cb81c16c419.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187061,"FileName":"19c335c4-1ba1-4508-872f-f4808e82f924.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187062,"Name":"Ballade for Maria","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Ballade For Maria the player controls Jake Spikes, a detective from New York.

The player navigates characters in real time on the overhead battle field in a point-and-click fashion, with enemies moving in real time as well. Each character represents a unit of a different type (such as knights, archers, magicians, etc., some with a general leading them). When a player-controlled and an AI-controlled unit are near each other the player can opt to view a full-screen animated battle sequence, the outcome of which is decided depending on the combatant's parameters. Like in regular RPGs, towns can be visited and establishments such as inns, shops and bars can be accessed (however, without free movement through the rest of the town). This can be done in the middle of the battle, provided a character is positioned near a town gate. Characters gain experience points, level up, and can equip a variety of weapons, armor and accessories.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/eRBudxBAxr8","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"b73d3490-bd67-42a3-b547-d47da0501c59.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"9d5372f5-e5c3-4a35-874d-6d7e8734a226.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"56322951-a51d-4c39-9c42-64734126170c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"1e5feee2-2d8c-4ecc-8e7c-4e23a0a9e083.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"0d9cf505-084b-4750-b7de-069630b27951.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"2734def6-49a3-425e-b297-58ca17669ebb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"ca54015c-a3b8-4308-bcd8-c9e84025459b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182546,"FileName":"338548fd-097a-414a-87ea-06edf3e09f2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182545,"Name":"Bible Master: Crash of the BlleotRutz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bible Master is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Glodia, which was released in Japan in 1993","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182545,"FileName":"03d96eb2-09f1-436a-b863-c5697f7dcda2.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182545,"FileName":"e29436c8-926c-4e76-ae7c-3066e21eaf3f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182545,"FileName":"5162e1cb-45d2-4297-b87f-c8a74e00afe6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182545,"FileName":"40a4423a-fb2b-4b85-b08c-9b34c82995c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182545,"FileName":"5addf9f4-efd5-4cfe-8e24-6f10d51fdf64.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182545,"AlternateName":"Bible Master","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189578,"Name":"Big Honour","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Big Honour: 3D Artifical Reality Professional Golf World is a Sports game, developed and published by Artdink, which was released in Japan in 1992.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"ArtDink","Publisher":"ArtDink","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189578,"FileName":"80fec428-33fb-467d-9d74-01703ae623e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189578,"FileName":"becbe507-5b6c-4542-9694-8c4e3037e614.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189578,"FileName":"fb64df30-aceb-45cc-8eff-dfbc111e743a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189578,"AlternateName":"Big Honour: 3D Artifical Reality Professional Golf World","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":192163,"Name":"Billiards Kyapikyapirun","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Billiards Kyapikyapirun is a Sports game, developed and published by Game Technopolis, which was released in Japan in 1988.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Game Technopolis","Publisher":"Game Technopolis","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197572,"Name":"Bind: Kinbaku Jinmon Densetsu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The content of the game can be easily deduced from its title (\"Kinbaku Jinmon Densetsu\" means the legend of bondage interrogation).

One of the scientists contacted then a young female hunter, a special agent trained in armed combat, to help him track down the bad guys and to stop the experiment.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"T2","Publisher":"T2","ReleaseDate":"1995-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156063,"FileName":"c78e4759-b121-47b5-afdb-47bdf19ab2b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156063,"FileName":"d3ccc7e3-0862-480f-a564-cfeb34640619.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156063,"FileName":"f3bf8d9a-c232-423b-99e5-4928014ca028.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156063,"FileName":"cb080701-b17d-40ca-97e7-8b7e03977873.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156063,"AlternateName":"美乳ハンター","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":189734,"Name":"Birdy World","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Birdy World is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Birdy Soft, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Birdy Soft","Publisher":"Birdy Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189734,"FileName":"85729c9c-4c4a-4e01-be31-ca561eaf2156.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189734,"FileName":"c133e5d3-8176-45c5-9dd8-620ee1fd368f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189734,"FileName":"d61ac8ad-0be0-4f94-be21-1879d5426761.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189734,"FileName":"d27b53ed-e59f-46c4-a828-fd9b3df66773.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187816,"Name":"Birthdays","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Birthdays is a dating simulation game.

The gameplay is similar to the previous Brandish games, with point-and-click interface (or keyboard short-cuts), real-time combat, and the ability to jump.

Shami has first to rescue the king's children, and eventually to find out the source of the demonic invasion.\n\nGameplay-wise, Branmarker mainly follows early Dragon Quest template: it is a top-down RPG with random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The player controls Shami and another character who joins the party. Shami can cast a variety of offensive and healing spells, the majority of which must be found in treasure chests located in the dungeons rather than bought or learned. The main gameplay takes part in hostile areas, which are reasonably complex and maze-like, taking a while to explore. Leveling up is automatic, and combat mechanics are basic Japanese RPG fare.

There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously).

The bonus rewards are then calculated, and the player is shown a full-screen, full-color picture of the girl.

You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map.\n\nOne part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship.\n\nAnother part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province.\n\nWhen you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight.\n\nWhen your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat.\n\nFinally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet.

But the Duke should be careful: who knows what challenges await for him among the demi-humans, outside of the safe walls of the capital city Berlin?..\n\nCrystal Quest is a puzzle game with adventure elements - the Duke's top-down movement and the ability to access different locations to tackle different puzzles. The locations are marked on the world map as towers and caves; in each one of them, a sexy demi-human will offer a challenge to the good Duke. The puzzles include a tile-matching memory game and a timed top-down maze sprint (find the exit before the time runs out). In each subsequent area, the difficulty of these puzzles increases, and the amount of clothes the demi-humans wear after a puzzle has been solved decreases.\n\nThe music in this game includes famous classical compositions by J.S.Bach, Tchaikovsky, Satie, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Pixy Bell","Publisher":"Pixy Bell","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203664,"FileName":"e0b3f116-868f-4ef4-980a-7700e471a4d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183280,"Name":"Crystal Rinal","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Youhei is a Japanese teenager who is bored with his life, unable to find excitement anywhere. Even sexual escapades with various women don't satisfy him: he craves for real adventures. But on that particular day, his wishes were fulfilled in a very unexpected way. He was talking to a schoolmate named Mahiro, a girl he didn't even like particularly, when something like an earthquake shattered the school. Youhei and Mahiro hurried to the nearby classroom, only to find a strange mirror-like object - which in fact was a portal to a dungeon in another world. Now the two teenagers have to find a way to escape from the dungeon - and eventually to return home.\n\nCrystal Rinal is an adult dungeon crawler along the lines of Words Worth or Raidy games; but instead of a lonely hero/heroine, the player controls a party of two, Youhei and Mahiro, who fight randomly appearing monsters in turn-based combat. There is also a \"talk\" command that lets the two heroes chat with each other and comment on the situation. Some gameplay segments follow the template of a Japanese adventure, with menu-based commands and multiple choices during dialogues.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"D.O.

Making sure no one is at home, he opens the box and finds a scroll with a magic incantation inside. He chants the magic spell - and immediately a cute female elf appears. She says she can create any girl the hero wants. But once the girl is created, he has to figure out how to win her good graces...\n\nCustom Mate can be called a \"seduction simulator\". Lacking the adventure elements of Cocktail's most famous series, Can Can Bunny, Custom Mate offers much deeper simulation gameplay instead. In the beginning of the game, the player effectively \"creates\" the girl he will need to seduce; it is possible to choose age, height, breast size, hair style, and personality. Mixing all these parameters results in different girls who require different approach. For example, an older, experienced and direct woman might appreciate physical stimulation (kissing etc.), while a young shy girl needs to talk more before the hero can afford any straight-forward actions.\n\nThe gameplay is menu-driven - the player can choose to talk, to ask, to look, to touch, to kiss, and to take off the girl's clothes. Choosing one of these actions usually leads to a sub-menu, which varies depending on the girl and the current situation. For example, the \"talk\" menu usually brings a large sub-menu of more precise actions (\"praise\", \"order\", \"beg\", etc.), each of which opens new sub-menus. Similarly, physical interaction can also become quite detailed: the \"kiss\" command opens a sub-menu (\"lick\", \"bite\", etc.). Physical interaction is made more precise by implementing a point-and-click interface; in many cases, choosing the exact body part to interact with can be a matter of \"life and death\", since it is possible to make a girl very angry, which might lead to a Game Over.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183283,"FileName":"20b35c69-72c3-437c-9eca-e84b78581c42.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183283,"FileName":"ded77dea-25e1-4627-8d8c-a19b1da7aea4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183283,"FileName":"1669a207-91ab-4d46-90c6-b0bb5658d3ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183284,"Name":"Custom Mate 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The second game in the Custom Mate series once again allows the hero to create the girl of his dreams; this time not magically, but by engaging the services of Custom Corporation, whose operator is nevertheless still the same cute elf who created the girls in the previous game.\n\nThe \"girl creation\" part offers more possibilities than before, such as exact bra size or the clothes the girl will wear (school girl, nurse, etc.).

Unlike the previous games, it is impossible to change appearance and physical aspects of the girl; however, there are many more personality traits.\n\nAfter the honeymoon, the couple returns to daily routine. The player can make daily or monthly schedule. The wife's behavior is determined by character creation, but also by the choices the player makes. The wife would often ask questions, make suggestions, etc.; the player's reaction determines future interactions and the overall development of the relationship. The couple has various parameters, from love level to monetary wealth. Sex interaction plays an important role; the player should choose the right actions, depending on the wife's personality, otherwise the relationship will deteriorate.

The player can choose the personality of the female character before beginning, influencing the story with this choice.\n\nA modern-day story without any supernatural elements, entitled Red Night. The protagonist is a man who finds himself in a hotel when a fire starts. Trying to escape, he enters a room occupied by a prostitute. The following events evolve slightly differently, depending on the personality choice made by the player before the start of the game.\n\nA sequel to the second episode of the first D.P.S. game. Once again, the player chooses either the male doctor Katsuki or the female doctor Katsumi whose goal is to seduce the patient, the cute school girl Yumiko.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games.

Now in New Daikoukai Jidai II, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:\nJoão Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\n\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. He yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great privateer in the name of king and country.\nRegardless of the character chosen, Daikoukai Jidai II is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: the Inn, the Item Shop, the Shipyard, the Tavern, the Castle, the Guild Hall, the Church, the Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187490,"FileName":"558b92b7-1cc8-4375-b6a0-2da90f246e43.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187490,"FileName":"6df51eee-de28-49ce-b1ec-172ba1fb85e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187490,"FileName":"b35cd3fe-2fa4-4ac9-b884-b6810afcb9bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187490,"FileName":"f233a798-6669-44f8-bcfb-c4cb7aa36b67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187108,"Name":"Daisenryaku IV","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Like the other games in the long-running Daisenryaku series, Daisenryaku IV is a strategy/war simulation game.\n\nUnlike most of the previous games in the series, Daisenryaku IV is a real-time strategy game.

In the beginning the parameters of the player character are generated.

Convincing women to buy condoms and/or have sexual intercourse usually involves carefully and repeatedly combining various commands.

Should the protagonist succeed in his amorous conquest, a censored, but unequivocally implicit sexual scene is shown.

The one that emerged stronger than before was Japan. It became the world's undisputed leader in technology. In the beginning of the 21st century, a company named Nexus began developing a new technology that would eventually lead to production of cyborgs. Nexus soon became the world's most powerful corporation. By then, cyborgs broke loose and caused violent incidents everywhere. A special unit called \"Hunter\" was deployed to combat them. But Nexus wouldn't stop with their experiments. In 2014, their newest project began, called \"Halleluja\"...\n\nIn Deep, the player can choose between four main characters, which include the result of the Halleluja project, an artificial young girl who is called \"Jesus\" and proclaimed to be the savior of the world, as well as three other, less important characters, all having their own agenda. The story is, however, the same for all characters.\n\nThe gameplay consists of moving on a map with grids and accessing different locations. Sometimes there would be branching paths, but the progression is mostly linear and the same for all characters. Most of the locations contain one screen with a character picture. It is possible to interact with characters in point-and-click fashion, with the cursor turning to \"Look\", \"Talk\", and other commands.\n\nSometimes, enemies would pop out and attack the player character. Some battles are pre-set and story-related. Even though the player characters have statistics and carry weapons, there are no real RPG elements in the game. The turn-based battles have a timer; if the player failed to choose an action within the time limit, the enemy will have a free turn. To make combat more challenging, the command menu is very large and has useful as well as useless commands, which are mixed up at the beginning of each turn.\n\nThe game contains graphics with explicit sexual content.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"JAST Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"JAST Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187113,"FileName":"db6b71cd-ecc1-470a-92e2-6dacc5fe4acd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187113,"FileName":"0b3c7436-b41b-46b6-a172-91dd3a3e8e27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187113,"FileName":"455b2b10-d06c-4f29-9446-78b5c2098490.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187113,"FileName":"76e53eca-58c6-4eb8-8c8b-7180d517478e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184694,"Name":"Deflektor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word.

A machine that occupies one room can produce an amount of energy that is strong enough even to disrupt time. During the presentation, unforeseen circumstances cause the machine to initiate a time shift, during which the head scientist Stockman and one of his subordinates are teleported to a fantastic world where psyonic powers take the place of technology, and where four different species have co-existed peacefully until the accident. The Dragon Tusk tribe gives shelter to Stockman, but he must undo the time shift, prevent further disasters, and find a way to return to his world...\n\nDifferent Realm plays like a traditional Japanese turn-based RPG, with party management, world map exploration, top-down view, and automatic leveling up. It also utilizes Glodia's patented combat system, which they also used in their other RPGs, such as Emerald Dragon and Vain Dream: characters are able to move on the battlefield, and the speed of attack depends on the distance between the controlled character and the enemy. The player has to assign initial parameters to the protagonist (Stockman) before the game begins.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/qc0GCkmnrV8","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185104,"FileName":"9e20dbde-7776-4ce5-bb6c-ec742a3bc179.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185104,"FileName":"a519b417-18a1-42d9-87fb-f6bf0c546965.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185104,"FileName":"bdd81554-1972-461f-9ef5-078692027b36.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185104,"FileName":"fb02619d-aa99-4629-aceb-20a609b7d4ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185104,"FileName":"abaf8940-acb7-46d1-879b-206b5d66b453.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185104,"FileName":"1570f62f-19d6-4f14-b3f0-9fc4985d45c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189589,"Name":"Digan no Maseki","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Artec","Publisher":"Artec","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189589,"FileName":"810f7764-1ef8-48be-b777-1b0f8613ce96.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189589,"FileName":"da0bcc8a-1daa-4be3-91c9-c250a469e383.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189589,"FileName":"4f2ecea2-4f75-4077-ad5a-ea9f8cf7f5cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189589,"FileName":"8bc846e2-8421-4efb-9504-ba798eb29136.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189589,"FileName":"e9ba5403-a35e-4e28-8988-ab755899eb18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189589,"FileName":"e8addc6a-07d1-4b13-9035-889b7406f375.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187123,"Name":"Dinosaur","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ash is a young mercenary who emerges victorious in every battle.

The latest \"butterfly assignment\" was to go to the kingdom of Zamhan and to follow the mayor's order. Will Ash finally find out the true answers to his mysterious destiny?\n\nDinosaur combines characteristic features of both Western and Japanese RPGs. Typically for the latter genre, the player is unable to create a party of adventurers; characters with their own backgrounds join Ash as dictated by the plot. However, the fully 3D first-person navigation is reminiscent of Western RPGs such as the Wizardry series. The enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. The party can rest at any time, restoring health and technique points. There is no auto-map feature; only the compass aids the player when navigating the maze-like dungeons of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187123,"FileName":"e2d2c963-db76-4ced-a382-cb284e17b34f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187123,"FileName":"b2b28b31-290b-406a-8909-1ebc1d73e6af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187123,"FileName":"941d6372-e35c-4fb9-9d88-5a3c1a3dc594.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187123,"FileName":"78e190b6-30d5-43f0-96d4-488a3bb169c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189590,"Name":"Dios","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Zainsoft","Publisher":"Zainsoft","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189590,"FileName":"ccb3f23c-83bc-471a-a396-682027acbfe2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190895,"Name":"Director Monogatari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Cross Media Soft","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190895,"FileName":"127a15c7-91c4-4694-a47e-f8e299e3fd9a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190895,"FileName":"f4739e8f-90c5-4431-90d8-62979cdad197.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190895,"FileName":"bab19bcf-0c1d-4ca0-9420-ecc6f0692120.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190895,"FileName":"2778663a-71e6-4488-b656-7fa7c37a7b31.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187124,"Name":"DIRES: giger・loop","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"DIRES (Digital Image Real-Time Energy Simulation) giger・loop is a 3D action game in which players steer aircraft and need to topple poles.

After a year-long hiatus, Compile would switch to a magazine format with pack-in disks, resetting their volume numbering format in the process. The first volume of the second incarnation of Disc Station released with a 5.25-inch floppy disk, volumes 2-8 used 3.5-inch disks, and the final three volumes used CD-ROMs.\n\nThis first edition had for example the first of a series of Nazo Puyo puzzles.

Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) refers to a product of Japanese sex doll industry commonly known as \"dutchwives\". One of such sex dolls has been stolen, and the Oranda Corporation hires a private investigator to retrieve it.\n\nThe second entry in Koei's self-proclaimed \"Strawberry Porno\" series (following Danchi-zuma no Yūwaku) has certain similarities to its predecessor in interface and overall concept. However, it is a much more open-ended game with emphasis on gradual exploration and interaction, which gives it a definite role-playing flavor in addition to basic adventure-like gameplay.\n\nLike in the preceding game, the player character is generated by stopping rapidly revolving counters assigned to individual parameters. These parameters influence the chance of success in subsequent encounters with women, though much of it is calculated randomly. The player area is a fairly vast top-down urban environment consisting of numerous interconnected screens, which are mapped as the player explores them.\n\nThe streets are populated by various types of NPCs. These include young women who would sleep with the main character for money, yakuza thugs who would attack if provoked, policemen, etc. These characters are randomly generated. The map also includes various locations such as several love hotels, adult shops, fast food restaurants, phone booths and police stations. The protagonist can spend money on various items sold in these establishments, bring women to love hotels, or try his luck with hostesses. The ultimate goal of finding the missing sex doll can be achieved by acquiring a few key items and finding the right NPCs among many others.\n\nThe interaction on the streets consists of inputting the key-bound commands Look, Transact, Attack, Present, and Rape. The latter command can be used on certain types of women on the streets (provided there are no witnesses) and leads to the so-called \"Fuck Mode\", which can also be brought forth by having consensual sex with hookers or indoor female characters. This mode features a few sex-related commands.\n\nIn addition, indoor locations have their own set of commands bound to function keys. These include making a phone call, various types of conversation (nice, normal, aggressive, etc.), attacking, attempting to have sex, etc. Attacking usually leads to a separate first-person combat screen. Combat is turn-based and has its own set of commands (attack with weapon, attack with bare hands, etc.). There are no experience points awarded, but the protagonist's hit points decrease when the enemy manages to damage him.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1984-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":199468,"FileName":"0ab98a28-2149-460e-b9d0-cecc40108ede.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":199468,"AlternateName":"Oranda Tsuma wa Denki Unagi no Yume o Miru ka?","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":192390,"Name":"Doki Doki Card League","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Doki Doki Card League is a Strategy game, developed and published by Great, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Great","Publisher":"Great","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192390,"FileName":"b72507e2-a02c-4ac9-b077-95aaa7ec6176.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192391,"Name":"Doki Doki Pretty League 1: Pink Angel Suki Kiippatsu no Maki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Doki Doki Pretty League 1: Pink Angel Suki Kiippatsu no Maki is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Great, which was released in Japan in 1994.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Great","Publisher":"Great","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192392,"Name":"Doki Doki Pretty League 2: Mou Hitotsu no Rival","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Doki Doki Pretty League 2: Mou Hitotsu no Rival is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Great, which was released in Japan in 1995.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Great","Publisher":"Great","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192436,"Name":"Doki Doki Pretty League 3: Minami no Umi no Kai no Maki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Pink Angels, who won the JPL-ONE league and entered the JPL league, now take a vacation to Okinawa.

Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?\n\nThe second Dragon Slayer is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise.

The game is set on a nameless island, which has elements of medieval fantasy as well as futuristic civilization. It allows the player to control a party of three female students from the School of Adventuring. The player can name the girls, but not change their unique battle techniques and proficiencies. The goal of the game is to reach a higher rank than the three competing teams (also containing girls only). Each team is accompanied by a guardian elf, and might also meet and/or hire other NPCs.\n\nThe game has an internal schedule, which reminds the player of the other competitors and what they might have accomplished in the meantime. Game progression is non-linear: the four cities on the island can be accessed right from the beginning. Each city contains special locations where the party can choose to accept a mission. These missions can also be completed in any order; each has an approximate difficulty label. Accepting a mission usually unlocks new hostile areas, which are inaccessible otherwise.\n\nDuring a mission, the game plays the same way as most other Japanese RPGs: exploring the dungeon, the party finds treasure and fights enemies in turn-based combat (viewed from first-person perspective). There are no random battles: all the enemies are visibly walking on screen and can be avoided. Combat largely relies on techniques, which are grouped by classes and are unique to each girl.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183317,"FileName":"35bd0dd5-3a3f-4025-a77a-57bff924c72d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183317,"FileName":"e7d831b3-c64a-41c0-bf11-dd543b0d1e31.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183317,"FileName":"6ee3e33a-672f-4fed-b895-3bbb63d7e229.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183317,"FileName":"6e96e340-16e1-44cb-8039-b6e16e54cc40.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183317,"FileName":"e8a01e92-6a24-4961-bddf-ee6ea374fe3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183317,"FileName":"ae0d27ef-df7c-4e12-a34b-5d2908951df9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183317,"AlternateName":"Eiyū Shigan: Gal Act Heroism","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189765,"Name":"Ekudorado: Kagami no Naka no Oukoku","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"A young high-school student named Seirou has a normal, boring life: days resemble each other, and so do the nights: every night he sees the same strange dream: two girls talking to each other, one of them saying something about a coming darkness... One day, he and his female classmates find a mirror in an abandoned house; when they touch the mirror, they are transported into the magical medieval land of Ekudorado. The hero must first find his classmates, who are scattered around this world, and then find a way to return to our reality...\n\nEkudorado is a mixture of card-based strategy and role-playing. The interaction in \"friendly\" areas (towns etc.) is done in Japanese adventure fashion; however, in order to access them, the player has to move the hero on a linear path composed of dots; each dot represents an enemy encounter. The battles follow a rather complex set of card game rules. At each turn, the player is dealt a deck of five cards. There are three kinds of cards: Law, Neutral, and Chaos, and six categories: Black, White, Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind. Each card stands for a unique type of action; for example, a Light Law card restores HP, a Fire Neutral card attacks the enemy with fire, etc. It is also possible to use combination of cards (up to three at a time), which leads to various results (for example, paralyzing the enemy while healing the hero). Even though other characters join the hero, it is possible to use only one character with one deck of cards per battle.\n\nThe RPG angle is present in character-building system: the hero gains experience points and levels up. Each time the player is given a certain amount of points to increase the hero's strength in the six elemental categories (Black, White, etc.).\n\nThe game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual content.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Black Package","Publisher":"Black Package","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189765,"FileName":"08b1efc3-3b28-4223-8e41-c7cd0c98abc9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189765,"FileName":"a3d31069-afed-4aad-8937-0d7e24cf4968.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189765,"FileName":"abfcdc11-782b-4ec5-91b5-df8b9160ba5a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188905,"Name":"El Dominion: Shin Tairiku no Hasha","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Japan Clary Business","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188905,"FileName":"419e69c4-001f-4274-b44f-e028ae19b1e0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188905,"FileName":"c83b2d36-48a7-4bb5-b8a4-69d595f2bda3.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188905,"FileName":"f7156509-1851-466b-8b46-7dcf25c3ff68.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188905,"FileName":"94e544d0-0042-4990-b7ac-e595870a5042.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188905,"FileName":"124ddee7-35fc-4a31-ac9f-a7805098bdba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188905,"FileName":"c411955b-7f26-4f3b-9925-c81f3748556a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187137,"Name":"Electric Device Marian","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Psyluth Decker is a young English nobleman.

For once, there are no random or regular battles - Nemo can freely roam the vast overworld map without fear of being attacked. Navigation is done in top-down fashion, while battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The pre-set battles (mostly against female elves) take place on a separate screen, and utilize a card system. Nemo can buy (or acquire from treasure chests or from other characters) cards, which stand for weapons, armor, magical spells, and items usually used in RPGs. Cards have their own elemental properties, so when choosing cards in battle, the player should pay close attention to the elements of the opponent's cards. It is also possible to fuse two or more cards into a more powerful one by using special cards.\n\nThe game is controlled entirely with the mouse.

The hero has \"force points\" and uses various \"force techniques\", which work like magic spells (healing, offensive, etc.).

One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...\n\nThe game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Basho House","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183174,"FileName":"f3964fd4-8975-4845-b759-1bddd85c1809.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183174,"FileName":"48c14d2c-232c-4476-9d6b-47080c7c182c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183174,"FileName":"c1f95db3-249e-459e-8a0d-90d3778f8b6e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183174,"FileName":"2eaf4f7e-3e7e-410c-beca-3d12b8261c2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183174,"FileName":"bf22fbda-4d98-461f-b0b9-4f7b3addb233.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187162,"Name":"EMIT Vol. 1: Toki no Maigo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Emit is a visual novel divided into 3 parts which was made to help Japanese people study English.

The player clicks on various objects on the screen to read descriptions, conduct conversations, and advance the story. There are no puzzles in the game. The interaction is more reduced as opposes to the previous game, though there are still some moments when the player is able to make a decision that will have an effect on the next scenes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Abogado Powers","Publisher":"Abogado Powers","ReleaseDate":"1996-05-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189234,"FileName":"3fcaf937-d68f-4a0e-be0b-fde2ee2655ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189234,"FileName":"8c86424a-faf0-41bc-a58b-f2d715f1f2db.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189234,"FileName":"59bcd45d-b5a2-4454-a678-ec1b9699cd1a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189234,"FileName":"0e787c89-1d80-4164-9fac-4831ac6b89b5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189234,"FileName":"d327639f-3674-43c4-b26e-72a75070f6da.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189234,"AlternateName":"Es no Hōteishiki","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":190948,"Name":"Escalation '95","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Escalation '95 doesn't have a particularly elaborate story: the protagonist is a female student named Naomi, who attends the Catholic St. Azarea high school.

Only five characters (beside Naomi) appear in the game, all of them new female students. There is menu-based navigation on the school map, but outside of the sex scenes, there is no other kind of interaction. During the sex scenes, however, a wide variety of actions is available. Naomi's partners have a special \"pleasure meter\"; the goal is to fill it by gradually performing the actions the girl approves of, which effectively turns the game into a simulation of sex.

A group of survivors has escaped into a cave, and it is from there that the nameless hero of the game begins his adventure.\n\nSimilarly to Kinpukurin's earlier RPG Free Will, Faladia combines elements of Japanese RPG (top-down navigation, random turn-based battles with simple mechanics, etc.) with a more \"Western\" approach to RPG design. The gameplay is focused on exploration rather than on linear advancement with scripted story events. Instead of the usual Japanese practice of assigning a few story-related party members, Faladia allows to recruit most of the NPCs the player encounters in towns (up to 9 active characters). The player can also choose one of the four ways of interaction with every NPC: neutral, \"loving\", haggling, and aggressive. Aggressive behavior invariably leads to fight; it is therefore possible to attack every NPC in the game (though in most cases it results in the death of the underpowered hero).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Kinpukurin","Publisher":"Kinpukurin","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"bd727af9-791f-4540-b576-6426d04820f7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"11543a7f-33cd-4f82-9728-d08bbe2e0493.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"9c2999f5-9109-44c6-a223-42b0ceb2dd7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"5f599bde-6d26-4d09-9287-98ee04f52610.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"32d18ce6-09b0-4322-b178-79c231e5b4b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"7c00bc91-f97c-4924-82f8-9b47ee8aacad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"2a889faa-e060-4742-8f5c-979d963d871b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187172,"FileName":"d07cc9f6-eb0e-45cf-b347-c2cd00607f35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183563,"Name":"Fall","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Queen Soft","Publisher":"Queen Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183563,"FileName":"a736c4f9-fc7d-46c8-80da-04fd9ebd3afc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183563,"FileName":"0add206b-c40c-48f6-afff-3a2539614151.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183563,"FileName":"248bcccf-3786-4690-8143-d46fc901f2c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183563,"FileName":"66424de5-0c98-4d32-9a56-c2be979f8518.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196095,"Name":"Falla no Jikekkai","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Heart Soft","Publisher":"Heart Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196095,"FileName":"804e186f-a897-4931-8478-2085bd915051.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187193,"Name":"Fantasian","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"The magical country of Luizard has been recently terrorized by the minions of the demon king Billades. The king of the country recruits a party of brave warriors, asking them to do the impossible: venture into the depths of Billades' lair, defeat the demon king, and release the Elven Seed that would restore the country to its glory.\n\nFantasian is a role-playing game that mostly relies on the Wizardry template. The player creates characters (up to five in the active party), choosing between traditional fantasy races (elf, half-orc, etc.) and classes. The latter are divided into four disciplines (thief, fighter, monk, and magician), each containing two classes, of which the less powerful one may evolve into a stronger form by meeting certain conditions during gameplay.\n\nThe player then takes these characters to explore an abstract maze, fighting randomly appearing enemies. Combat takes place on a top-down screen and is similar in concept to that of Ultima games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187193,"FileName":"365c3b60-42c2-480a-970d-5181bf6419ff.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187193,"FileName":"7c50b3da-3087-4b7b-ac20-65ab5078501e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187193,"FileName":"8cc436ed-3be5-4560-bc1e-a971c83d2a0d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187193,"FileName":"0d68cf0c-4b84-4194-bee6-27e80b28281a.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187193,"FileName":"946def39-fbf9-4a02-bd7e-79513f4ded83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187193,"FileName":"2dfc08bc-ff0e-4e08-a1ac-1f049ace2a8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189371,"Name":"Fantasy Knight","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Fantasy Knight is a Strategy game, developed and published by System Soft, which was released in Japan in 1988","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"System Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189371,"FileName":"a887caae-2fba-4f9e-9de5-39aefb94f5d6.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189371,"FileName":"c03bcdb7-7f2e-4b20-9f3d-04e7ff85ac57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189371,"FileName":"08e6e630-7ad4-4b0e-af14-26f8e2e36061.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189371,"FileName":"6e1d99ce-b87f-4db7-b581-68ca1b56d36d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189371,"FileName":"59e1af3f-b7ff-4098-967f-9a31ab5c4af0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185098,"Name":"Far Side Moon: Chikyuu Boueidan 2","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Far Side Moon: Chikyuu Boueidan 2 is a Simulation game, developed and published by Artdink, which was released in Japan in 1989","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"ArtDink","Publisher":"ArtDink","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185098,"FileName":"ae55fbd2-a0a9-4443-9b31-38caa48da3bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185098,"FileName":"6049cda3-abda-4f98-ae53-3f23ec63c80b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185098,"FileName":"707fabd8-b90c-4bff-8245-4fb1156afbdb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185098,"FileName":"df9be0a5-957d-4afc-afd4-0a0f4e8bc132.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185098,"FileName":"4dc62c02-7850-4064-885a-d80a00e20510.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185098,"FileName":"470a7741-1e1c-4045-9a2b-708d8381d87f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185098,"AlternateName":"Far Side Moon: The Earth Self-Defense Force II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188907,"Name":"Farce: Yuuwaku Hakusho","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Tachioki Izumi holds a detective office with his childhood friend as his assistant.

There is also a cursor shaped like an eye that the player can periodically use, but it serves mostly to click on the visible body part and advance the conversation.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cat's Pro","Publisher":"Cat's Pro","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189842,"FileName":"e85ad5dd-d613-49ef-bc82-d546f5902a7a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189842,"FileName":"f2733368-c65a-42be-b417-c9ca0f2a7849.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188912,"Name":"Fifth Element II: Hikari to Yami no Ouji","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fifth Element II: Hikari to Yami no Ouji is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by You-en-tai, which was released in Japan in 1993","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"You-En-Tai","Publisher":"You-en-tai","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188912,"FileName":"bde70eda-9559-4236-a50a-ca87b94477cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188912,"FileName":"9cedf2f1-d4e6-4732-b640-65378293cfaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188912,"FileName":"17cc40a0-a4f0-4acd-873e-9e185609fbb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188912,"FileName":"59d2ded7-0e71-4f29-8667-d80d6f75ef2a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188908,"Name":"Fifth Element: Tamashii no Genso","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fifth Element: Tamashii no Genso is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by You-en-tai, which was released in Japan in 1992","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"You-En-Tai","Publisher":"You-en-tai","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188908,"FileName":"9e8d6ec3-167b-40b9-af20-197151ed6e12.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188908,"FileName":"9c6c7206-ddb5-4919-923a-7fdbde38763c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188908,"FileName":"51ecbffc-7172-4164-8554-a31381456d21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188908,"FileName":"7df6ffa2-1325-437c-b216-4db50c81f84e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197634,"Name":"Figure: Ubawareta Houkago","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An oligarch named Takanashi has built a prestigious girl's high school, known as the Hanatsuki High.

Battles occur when the player navigates the main character to a spot occupied by a girl and chooses to attack her.

It is divided into many small kingdoms, different nations trying to live in peace with each other. But the queen of Ornic, one of these nations, had plans of her own. She sent her troops to the south, invading the kingdom of elves. The army of Ornic started conquering one country after the other. The king and queen of Cardic, a powerful country in the south, decided to stop the madness, sending their soldiers, under the commands of general Richmond, to find allies wherever possible and to defeat the army of Ornic.\n\nFirst Queen is a mixture of RPG and strategy game with real-time combat. In a RPG fashion, the party of heroes roams the world, fighting enemies, buying items, and leveling up. However, the focus of the game is shifted towards recruiting soldiers and fighting against whole armies. The player-controlled unit may contain a dozen or more characters, and it is also possible to build more than one, making the player-controlled group more similar to an army than to a standard RPG-type party. Like the earlier Silver Ghost by the same developer, the game utilizes the so-called gocha-kyara (\"mixed-up characters\") combat system, which they later employed in several other games. The player is able to control only one character at a time; the others act according to the computer AI. Attacking an enemy is a matter of simply bumping into him.

Humans have to unite against the common enemy. But years of existence as separate nations did little to strengthen their bonds. The powerful kingdom of Ilion was the first to take action in uniting the humans. Aided by the goddess Athena, the female general Ayla and her army begin a journey to seek the help of other nations and to defeat the demons.\n\nThe third entry in First Queen series retains the gameplay formula from the previous games, but emphasizes fantasy elements, anime/manga aesthetics, and more detailed characterization of the main heroes, typically for traditional Japanese RPGs. The strategic angle of commanding large armies is unchanged, as is the gocha-kyara (\"mixed-up characters\") battle system, featuring large-scale fights with dozens of friendly and enemy characters.

When the humans arrived, the cultural differences between the races were not enough to provoke a war, so for a while they co-existed peacefully. Afterwards, the humans have split into several smaller nations. The nation of Barcia in the north had a small population, and its king Zenel was worried his country will be conquered by others. To prevent that, he invited the dark magician Zon, who cast a spell over his soldiers. But nothing comes without a price. Insanity seized the king and its army. Barcia began invading other countries. A warrior named Ares and his friends try to assassinate the king, but as a result, Ares is thrown in prison. A mysterious man with magical powers saves Ares, telling him that it's time to sort out the differences between nations and races, and lead an army to stop the madness of Barcia...\n\nThe fourth entry in First Queen series utilizes the trademark \"mixed-up characters\" battle system, with dozens of characters on both sides fighting each other in real time. The game features a new point-and-click interface, with battle tactics accessible at any moment from the battle screen. It is also possible to focus attacks on an enemy simply by clicking on him with the mouse. Compared to the previous entries, First Queen IV emphasizes the war game aspect, with less focus on RPG-like exploration and more strategic challenge. The movement on the map has grown into an important gameplay device: different armies move simultaneously, and the player has to pay attention for enemy forces advancing to different locations. It is possible to split units, create new ones, exchange soldiers, and send different units to different locations. An enemy army may join forces with the heroes upon defeat; diplomacy can also be used to make agreements with sovereign city-states.

The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.\n\nEach unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.\n\nBetween the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183344,"FileName":"e6ff5f38-e5d3-4319-8309-c55830ad0e85.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183344,"FileName":"296ff726-1216-482b-87c5-7208f3140216.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183344,"FileName":"08ca3d3b-55aa-4578-ad46-ebd072a1df55.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183344,"FileName":"cdc36edf-d726-462b-b6f1-bcf4b6831818.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183344,"FileName":"1ff4cba3-1e89-4cff-ad11-b9266bd2589c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183345,"Name":"Foxy 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the near future, mankind has abandoned the Earth, which has become unsuitable for human life.

She studies magic in a university for three years and afterwards begins a long journey to find Latok and to help him in his battle against evil.\n\nThis is a top-down action game, which can be called a shooter of the run and gun variety, even though it is set in a medieval world. Fray can only use her staff, which works as a ranged weapon, casting projectiles. By pressing down the action button, it is possible to increase the size and the power of the projected missile. With the exception of towns, the screen scrolls vertically when Fray moves forward. Like in most shooters of this type, Fray receives damage when she touches an enemy or hit by its projectile attack. Fray visits towns on the way, where she can buy weapons, armor, potions, and magical spells.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/XpNtHYBa5wY","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187200,"FileName":"a6f588a4-e9a8-493f-ad0f-38a97322bcb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187200,"FileName":"8f8c60f0-c100-4b42-a9d1-73b2d2aa4d65.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187200,"FileName":"24b56fe9-3137-42c8-acd4-4e892db3705e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187200,"FileName":"2ba6464c-2d81-4ce4-8ab0-9f065a9d8439.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187201,"Name":"Free Will: Knight of Argent","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"The hero of the game is an apprentice swordsman who lives in a secluded tower, studying martial arts with the old master Daido.

Receiving the blessings of the wise teacher, the hero immediately begins the long journey, hoping to find companions who would help him on his quest to find the missing knight.\n\nFree Will: Knight of Argent contains elements of a traditional Japanese-style RPG, such as top-down world map navigation, random battles, simple character growth (automatic level up), etc. However, it has several features rarely found in games belonging to this genre. Each dialogue with an NPC brings a menu with four options: Information, Companion, Justice, and Negotiate. \"Information\" corresponds to standard NPC conversation; \"Negotiate\" is mostly used in shops to buy items, but can also be used in specific situations to trigger events. The two other commands are the more interesting ones. It is possible to convince an NPC to join the party; this doesn't rely on story events, and since there are many characters who would join, it is possible to build completely different and quite large parties. The \"Justice\" commands is basically attacking an NPC on the spot. It is possible to attack anyone, even key plot characters - although in most cases, naturally, the battle will be over very quickly, and the hero would be \"welcome to heaven\", as the game itself calls it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Kinpukurin","Publisher":"Kinpukurin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187201,"FileName":"1ddaf715-22e8-4fd9-925f-eac141bbc75c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187201,"FileName":"e975dd19-aaef-4f4c-be36-0c0ec1f5edae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187201,"FileName":"149334f2-e58c-445e-96a6-87e65ac521b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187201,"FileName":"cbda562d-d80c-4d1f-907d-808b4ce5407b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182668,"Name":"Frontier","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A collection of three stories:\n1. 遠雷ワイバーン is about a bounty hunter who stays at the inn and is requested to rescue a kidnapped girl.\n2. 快感空間「愛」is about a couple who get summoned to another world one day.

They had high hopes of building the \"Japan of the future\" and educating the young ones: the central place on the island was dedicated to a high school.

Amatsukami Hidehiko, the last (and youngest) of the oligarchs, decides to change the way of things. Using his charisma, but also more violent tactics, he goes to the troubled school to deal personally with anyone who dares oppose him.\n\nGakuen King is a peculiar mixture of typical Japanese RPG with random turn-based battles, strategy elements (recruiting students to join Hidehiko's army), and adventure elements (\"search\" command, finding and manipulating items), with extended sex scenes that have Japanese adventure-style menu-based interaction. The basic gameplay is that of a top-down RPG: Hidehiko walks around, fights random enemies, levels up, etc. The combat system is rather basic: Hidehiko's party (or, better to say, army) is treated like a single character - the player is only able to give general commands (attack, use special powers, retreat, etc.), after which the battle unfolds automatically. That is why the player also has to focus on adventure-like exploration to solve problems and overcome obstacles, as well as constantly enlarging the army to become stronger.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Alice Soft","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183676,"FileName":"65b96862-057b-428b-8196-bc8ba45c3f9a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183676,"FileName":"becd92eb-f872-481c-820a-dfc149331bd4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183676,"FileName":"92d1ea69-eeb3-44b8-bafb-147d3d54566f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183676,"FileName":"7e3e5bc2-2905-4dcc-8850-de087fe53d3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183676,"FileName":"8a1cd3ac-290e-4279-97a5-ce74b8fab9b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183676,"FileName":"0c095f63-85e8-4237-953f-ccc82a7e3fbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183676,"AlternateName":"Gakuen King: Hidehiko Gakkō o Tsukuru","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187212,"Name":"Gakuen Monogatari '93: The Instinct","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Millions of light years away from Earth, on a planet called Cicero, there existed a highly advanced civilization.

Indeed, it is based off of the arcade version of Gradius III, and uses much of the graphics and music from that title. All of the signature weapons, like the laser, ripple, twin shot, and even the options, are present. Iconic Gradius enemies like the Big Core even show up.\n\nHowever, this game was not produced or authorized by Konami; it is the work of an independent doujin fan-game circle known as CO2-PRO. It is also different from the other entries in the series: though much of the artwork and music is lifted from Konami's game, the stages themselves are not.

Most of the planet turned into a desert. But humanity survived. Humans built new cities in the wilderness, and new organizations emerged.

With the exception of the original post-apocalyptic theme and a few original gameplay elements, the game looks, feels, and plays very similarly to early Ultimas.\n\nIn the beginning of the game the player has to create and name the protagonist. Four classes are available: Soldier, an all-purpose fighter type; Karateka, specialist in unarmed combat; Esper, who relies on psychic forces; and Doctor, who focuses on healing. The player can freely allocate points into the four available character attributes: Strength, Duration (Endurance), Dexterity, and IQ.\n\nAfterwards, the player is thrown into the game world. Gameplay process is non-linear; rather than following a narrative with scripted events, the player explores the world and travels to its locations in any order. Interaction with the world is performed with menu commands such as \"Attack\", \"Enter\" (a location represented on the map as an icon), \"Transaction\", etc. Enemies are visibly roaming the world map; a contact with any of them leads to a separate small isometric battle screen, on which the playable character can freely move, attack physically, or use psychic powers in turn-based fashion.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Square Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Square Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183761,"FileName":"4e8757fa-ae69-4238-9999-c044ab8016d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183761,"FileName":"2587e4e9-a87f-4ad8-a4fa-777455ac9853.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183761,"FileName":"ec3ceab2-18d4-4528-95b0-ef3eedbfcbba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183761,"FileName":"532cfdd0-fdeb-4714-8394-d81c34832d9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196513,"Name":"Genji","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Main character is legendary Genji who searches for a killer.\nThe first three games of Hot-B were original and left a really good impression.

The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.\n\nThe game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around \"historical\" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.\n\nThe combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space.

The enemies are a weird mixture of half- or completely naked women (demonic or otherwise), strange-looking monsters, or ordinary types, such as a beer-drinking or suitcase-carrying man. It is possible to talk to some of the enemies to avoid combat.

Naturally, it was no coincidence that Akira ended up there: the balance of both worlds is in danger, and only a person from our dimension can restore it. To do that, Akira has to travel to the spirit kings of the five elements, and complete a magical ritual that would prevent both universes from collapsing.\n\nGrounseed could be called a \"minimalist Japanese RPG\", since many typical elements of the genre are omitted: there are no usable items, no money, no equipment, no world map navigation, no random enemies, and even no levels: the characters become stronger immediately after having defeated an enemy (increased strength, HP, etc.). Enemies can be seen wandering on the screen, and usually there aren't many of them around. Akira and his two companions can attack physically or utilize techniques, which deplete technique points (TP). One of the characters also has healing magic spells. To counter the lack of \"hardcore\" Japanese RPG gameplay, the game has extended cut scenes and long conversations between the characters..","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Studio Twinkle","Publisher":"Exit","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187241,"FileName":"7b864a7a-3cda-4b6b-a6ed-a0f7fc60f7b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187241,"FileName":"cf4e23b7-354d-4644-97f3-c1b6975fc5df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187241,"FileName":"d4a5e377-8a55-4716-8657-c6833d1d1f51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187241,"FileName":"3d2f27ab-b38c-43fd-bdd1-533929b980ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187241,"FileName":"949b12c0-772f-45ef-8361-8d247561bd7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187241,"FileName":"632964e8-d98c-4c34-81f7-ce74bf63b66a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189386,"Name":"Group-X","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Compac Inc","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189386,"FileName":"7a2012fc-6849-46a3-89ae-11d53773cc6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189386,"FileName":"a23ea860-7d00-42b5-8f2d-ef09f3569e13.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183019,"Name":"Guardian Recall: Shyugojyuu Shyoukan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Guardian Recall: Shyugojyuu Shyoukan is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Agumix, which was released in Japan in 1996","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Agumix","Publisher":"Agumix","ReleaseDate":"1996-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183019,"FileName":"87397bfa-8485-47e1-b09c-599a6f33c777.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183019,"FileName":"702a1b35-dd05-46b3-a8f7-85f87962a564.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183019,"FileName":"6f6cefc6-cc6c-4a29-898a-e543667f899c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183019,"FileName":"b3f66d50-5e7e-4f96-87d4-b9861ea2e9ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183350,"Name":"Guernica","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long time ago, human passions caused the appearance of a monster tribe that has since become unwelcome in the human society.

There is no party, no monetary system, and no equipment of any kind. Only bars and inns can be accessed in towns. The world map is completely linear, as the protagonist is only able to move on the roads and locations appear on it only when triggered by the plot. Much of the game consists of exploring hostile locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat that allows only physical attacks and usage of healing items that are randomly dropped by the foes.

But the girl (whose name is Jewel) explains that she is being hunted by the mysterious society of Rosenkreuz. Her father was a great scientist who knew how to make items out of pure ether; his zeppelin was attacked, and the Rosenkreuz are after the ether-made necklace Jewel is wearing. Mark, Jewel, and their friends have to find a way to defeat the Rosenkreuz and their leader, the ambitious Irene, who won't stop until the entire world is under her control...\n\nGunBlaze plays like a story-driven Japanese RPG, with the real-world setting adding some unusual gameplay elements. Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.\n\nOtherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.\n\nDespite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Active Software","Publisher":"Active Software","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":180894,"FileName":"e9a7d65c-5f05-479d-915b-ccc73dd58920.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180894,"FileName":"5b82bf59-0550-4727-80f0-0e8f1d5649cc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183490,"Name":"Gunship","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gunship depicts one of the Western world's finest attack helicopters: The AH-64A Apache.

However, this co-existence is anything but peaceful, since androids are going rampant, and a special police force known as ACP (\"Anti Criminal-cyborg Police\") is specifically assigned to deal with them. Two young and lovely police officers, Angelica and Apple, receive a S.O.S. signal from two army pilots, who were attacked by a mysterious female cyborg who called herself Patricia von Kreuzel. Upon arriving at the crime scene, the heroines find no survivors. Together with their colleague, a young detective named Keith, they must investigate and solve this case.\n\nDespite the title, the game focuses on the depiction of the futuristic world and detective/mystery narrative much more than on display of attractive young women. The game focuses on text and story-related information rather than interaction; whenever it is possible to interact with the environment, the player (controlling Keith) is usually confined to one screen. Clicking on various objects/people on the screen calls forth a menu with verb commands, but usually only one or two are present (\"Examine\" or \"Talk\"). Examining all or most of the objects triggers the advancement of the story.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/c0E-IwsYZgI","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cat's Pro","Publisher":"Cat's Pro","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"ea3a2a92-8915-4ba0-8121-d225251ecbac.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"db6721de-1858-46b2-b1ff-b72db57296e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"51fbb48d-a788-47ca-ba30-69e22266ad41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"4f1820e1-bc1c-4c8e-bd30-56ecfeb34cc9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"028488e6-f1f3-4386-8fa1-65d70d75d8fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"c6279555-9a19-44c9-83fb-ff063f56ae21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187287,"FileName":"519888fe-d5fb-4942-af31-45756b7f64d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187277,"Name":"H+","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The title H+ is rather self-explanatory to those who understand the meaning of the letter \"H\" to the Japanese (pronounced \"ecchi\", it basically refers to all things sexual).

The interview begins with taking pictures of the celebrity wearing different costumes, and ends with her removing those costumes and performing activities which turn into a blockbuster porn movie.\n\nThe third story is dedicated to the obligatory \"little girl\", a female high-school student. There are two possible scenarios, both involving seduction of the poor girl: one involves a sexy female teacher, the other an older male schoolmate.\nThe gameplay is identical in all three scenarios, and is that of a visual novel combined with some point-and-click activities. The player first chooses the correct approaches to win the favors of the female counterparts, while the more physical part of the seduction involves clicking on various parts of the partner's body in order to trigger the next scene.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"Desire","Publisher":"Desire","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187277,"FileName":"20367209-cc2a-4082-910f-f5ae47d09a8c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187277,"FileName":"cd0b1816-6078-4824-9366-52fa2875b5e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187277,"FileName":"48f6618f-0bc5-4dca-b5dc-3ad1da4489fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195517,"Name":"Hacchake Ayayo-san","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hacchake Ayayo-san is a very short visual novel starring Ayayo, a seventeen-year-old girl who finds a part-time job as a clerk in Mr. Suzuki's shop.

Each story contained is dedicated to a different heroine:\nSuzuka and her boyfriend escape from ninjas; they are ambushed by amazon warriors and get separated. Suzuka finds herself in a weird mansion overrun by monsters, and must fight her way with a sword. This game is an adventure with top-down movement; the goal is to find the way through the maze-like locations. There are also pre-set turn-based battles - Suzuka can choose between various techniques to defeat the foes. There is no RPG system of any kind. The sex scenes include grotesque encounters with monsters.\n\nEve is a saleswoman in a large company that sells items for skin care and make-up. She has to explore the neighborhood and to convince customers to buy their products. This story plays like a standard Japanese adventure with first-person view and menu-based commands. The sexual content here is mostly of lesbian nature.\n\nThe protagonist in this story is the \"hero\" of the entire game (default name Tatsuya); he offers his services to Selena, the queen of the medieval Rabbi-Rabbi kingdom. Evil bunnies are disturbing the peace in the country side, and the hero, aided by the lovely girl Nina, has to get rid of them and bring back the carrots. This is an action game, with bunnies popping out of holes in different stages, and the player character hitting them on the heads using various items (such as a house shoe).\n\nThe shortest game tells the story of Titis, a lovely mermaid who dreams of marrying a human prince. In search for the love of her life, Titis gets to know the world of humans through a series of sexual encounters. This game is once again a typical Japanese adventure with menu-based commands and no movement of any kind (the player switches locations automatically, as dictated by the story).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187279,"FileName":"c8639acb-e0ad-4c4a-a8b7-70fbe979e5e8.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187279,"FileName":"89fb953b-0fd5-473e-be8c-abc1d87a46f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187279,"FileName":"3084d470-861d-47ce-affb-f2f803b6ea60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187279,"FileName":"d2f10671-8905-48cd-b133-e7db48c5b66f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187279,"FileName":"02442069-f752-4004-bceb-7a7a48a75eb6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187279,"FileName":"5be4c5b8-f643-450f-8475-c8b610fcee15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187280,"Name":"Half-Pipe","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the year 199X, a huge meteorite collided with the Earth. The consequences exceeded every disaster seen before. Even long after the collision, due to the distortion of gravity, volcano eruptions, earthquakes, and other disasters continued to occur. Civilization has shrunk into small cities spread across vast wasteland. The level of violence has raised beyond the imaginable.\n\nIn such a terrible world, the 18-year-old musician named Damian has to earn his living by playing piano in a bar in the city of Gunu. One day, something falls on the Earth right in front of him - this \"something\" being a girl named Nicole, who apparently arrived from the mysterious meteorite. The first task assigned to the hero, if you haven't guessed it, is to get Nicole some clothes. Naturally, this soon develops into a much more sinister story musicians usually don't get involved into...\n\nHalf-Pipe differs from traditional Japanese RPGs in several aspects. Even though there is a party (up to four people), during combat the player has to choose one character at a time. Most of the battles are random, but there are many that can be triggered by talking to a character. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective. Damian is controlled by the player, while the other three (all girls) are controlled by the AI. Only when Damian's HP reaches zero, the game is over. Damian can use a variety of attacks (punches, kicks, etc.). There are no weapons or armor in the game. Even though there is an overworld map heroes can travel on, much of the action happen in the large cities, which take time to explore.\n\nFemale characters disrobe when defeated in combat, and there are plot-related cutscenes with explicit sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Aypio","Publisher":"Aypio","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187280,"FileName":"cd1af87c-cce9-468e-8274-aa6b2a11850d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187280,"FileName":"a872c648-45ed-443d-9b17-2a2338ab3a29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187280,"FileName":"54f6c8cb-6311-44ae-91f2-bbaf7da3918a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187280,"FileName":"51f31d71-0a3d-453b-97a8-b99dc5206d86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187281,"Name":"Hamlet","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"What does the story of this game have to do with Shakespeare's famous masterpiece? Absolutely nothing. The word \"hamlet\" is used here in its original meaning, \"little village\". This was the (somewhat ironic) name that was given to a massive project, which started in the 1980-ies yet was first accomplished in the second decade of the 21th century: a research laboratory built on the surface of the Moon. By the middle of the century, Hamlet become one of the most important industrial centers in the world. It manufactured food, medicine, vehicles, and above all - high-technology weapons. Until one day, the contact between the Earth and Hamlet was broken. Suddenly, Hamlet was cut from the rest of the world.\n\nThe owners of the station send a team of six highly trained agents, piloting advanced giant robots (\"mechs\"), led by Conrad V. Eibol (codename \"Boss\"). The mission: enter Hamlet's facilities and find out what happened. When the heroes arrive, they find the first level completely abandoned... except a few mechanisms which have seemingly gone berserk. The youngest of the team, simply addressed as \"Kid\", is sent to explore the lower level, maintaining communication with the others over the radio.\n\nHamlet is a first-person perspective game, set in the huge 3D maze-like eponymous facility. The auto-map is always visible, showing the player the character's position. Enemies and important objects are also visible on the radar. Whenever an enemy approaches, the playable robot is unable to move. The shooting is actually done in turn-based style; the player can only shoot once the robot's attack meter has filled up, and the rate of shooting depends on the robot's (or enemy's) agility. However, the game doesn't pause when the shooting occurs, creating the illusion of real-time combat.\n\nThough the game looks like a first-person shooter, it is, in its core, an RPG. Player-controlled robot receives experience and levels up after having defeated certain amounts of enemies. Attack, defense, speed, etc. get increased with each level up. It is possible to find and equip various kinds of weapons: a basic gun with infinite ammo, but low damage; powerful rocket launchers which cause high damage, yet have limited ammunition, etc. Two weapons can be equipped in each hand, and the player can switch between them during combat. Shields can also be found and equipped. Weapon energy, body (\"health\"), and shield energy can be restored with appropriate items.\n\nAn updated version of the game (with enhanced graphics and view angles) was later released in The West under the name Space Griffon VF-9.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Panther Software Inc.","Publisher":"Panther Software Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"b5beab23-0dfa-47d4-a94c-55f870461ed4.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"e25a0b8b-afd5-4f0a-8b0b-b8c6eed9b492.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"0a815ec2-4503-4bb0-aafe-60c6b544e826.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"03eec28d-0296-4cf2-b865-2ba691789b98.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"ab4a1adb-3c43-4bb5-9787-30d069a5aadd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"37e5421c-114a-44d3-bdfd-5caec4eeed71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187281,"FileName":"e6ea64dc-42c7-43ae-b72a-9a141069138d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192054,"Name":"Hana no Kioku Dai 2 Shou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Collection of five short erotic stories.\n\n1.

I can only hope it's actually an emulation error and not supposed to sound like that.\n\nThis game later came out in a Windows CD-ROM version, which has full voice acting that sounds fine, but otherwise differs little from the original release. While technically a PC-98 game, the image runs fine under Windows 10 when mounted with a CD emulator.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Active","Publisher":"Active","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189242,"FileName":"c3539c48-d80d-4145-8210-8a8b2f2be7fb.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189242,"FileName":"09654409-46fd-4966-b2fa-e32ce6c25fce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189242,"FileName":"ef6caea9-4790-441f-acb7-a6df70802767.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190722,"Name":"Harajuku After Dark","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The corpse of a fashionably dressed man was discovered in the park spurring the Harajuku police department into action.

The young prince doesn't hesitate. Very soon, he leads the army of monsters into battle, unaware of the price he will have to pay for that...\n\nHiōden is a strategy game with RPG elements. The player navigates several teams of characters, mostly monsters (up to six in each team) through isometric environments. Sometimes cooperation between different player-controlled teams is required to advance. The game plays in real time, i.e. enemy parties also move and perform actions without waiting for player's input. The RPG angle is present in form of character levels - characters grow stronger after defeating enemies. It is possible to put the teams on \"auto-mode\", having some of them move and perform actions on their own.\n\nThe game has a mouse-driven interface with a somewhat unusual feature for its time: windows. The movement field of different teams, character statistics, overview map, team management screen - everything has its own window. It is possible to enlarge any window to full screen, close it, open several small windows at the same time, and drag windows to arrange them on the screen in any way.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"55e049db-8eb9-4baa-bb9d-7c878f3a9ce1.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"bd4f359a-5626-4d58-b9af-968c9f26bc8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"e078add5-5bd2-43a9-b3a3-43853e27c4fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"889eb7fe-931d-42c1-bdb7-5f404a62b75b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"e16465ca-a8cb-46df-bf4f-e82ecc752206.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"a8c8d7ba-d55b-4794-9ba0-2ba086c00c5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187288,"FileName":"c698f874-bcec-45b6-88af-19c7a2be46d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187291,"Name":"Hiouden II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"When Richard MacIntyre, the hero of the first Hiōden, became old, he retired from his duties, intending to spend the rest of his days in a secluded location together with the dryad Beatrix.

The player commands one or more teams at the same time. The battles are mostly automatic, with preparation having more weight that the actual commands during battles. There is an option to \"stop the clock\" and adjust the strategy. Most of the gameplay involves exploring the maze-like isometric location with the player's teams, fighting enemies on the way, gathering treasure, and solving (mostly very simple) puzzles to advance to the next area.

But so did crime. Huge corporations, which were in fact criminal organizations, came to control the world. Finally, a mega-corporation known as Connection has taken the power in its hands. Everything was sponsored with its money; the governments and the law were silent. Only vigilante groups called \"Connection-Killers\" still tried to resist. In 2015, in Detroit, one of those people, nicknamed DD, witnessed the death of his comrades...\n\nA year has passed. DD moves to Brain City - a highly developed, modern city, the center of scientific research. It was built on an island in the Atlantic Ocean, which appeared after a volcano eruption. It is controlled by Connection. DD opens an investigation office in the city, trying to get to the heart of Connection and defeat his old nemesis, despite the hostile atmosphere and the grave dangers that await him there...\n\nHis Name is Diamond is a RPG with top-down navigation and first-person turn-based combat. The player controls DD as he moves through the urban environments of the game. The enemies appear randomly and are mostly grotesquely exaggerated everyday people (workers, journalists, etc.), with a large amount of sexy women. DD deals with the enemies through various menu commands. Instead of a simple \"attack\" option, there are various techniques and extensive item usage, so that many of the fights feel almost like mini-puzzles.

Later the hero understood that what he did was wrong; Reiko was just a child back then. His atonement was perhaps a bit strange; he traveled to China, and studied there the game of mahjong. So now he is back, and he is determined to invite the now fully-grown Reiko (and other pretty girls in the town) to... more strip mahjong games!\n\nThe game unfolds pretty much the way you'd expect from a strip mahjong game: the player must beat the girls in mahjong, one by one.

They can build hotels, hire chefs and managers, train them, get loans from banks, buy or sell stocks to increase their revenue. Players can use a telephone to call financial advisors that will give them information about their competitors, an insurance company to avoid losing too much money in case of a fire, a Yakuza member who will help players hijack their competitor's hotel (At the cost of extorting money from the player each month) and the police which will fine players for using the services of the Yakuza but will protect them from future payments to the mafia. Players can also take over the hotels of their competitors. Players that have gone bankrupt will have their hotels bought out by their competition.\n\nThe game progresses on a monthly basis and each time players choose what to do, the game displays their monthly earnings and losses. Economic factors also play a key role in the game as the game pinpoints the state of economy during gameplay. In order to win this game, players must be the first to build a chain of 10 hotels and make a revenue of $5000000. In case no player has achieved this goal, the game continues until the deadline assigned by the player in the beginning of the game.\n\nThere are a few events to look out for in the game:\nIn April, a tax inspection will take place.

In case players can't pay the fine, they will have their hotel seized.\nDepending on the skills of the chefs, the hotel visitors may get food poisoning, especially during Summer. If that happens, the hotel where the food poisoning occured will be suspended for one month.\nThere is high probability of catching fire in Winter. When this happens, players will permanently lose their hotel. This probability is connected to the manager's skills, as well as the state of the economy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Bothtec, Inc.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187308,"FileName":"f5849df4-e42f-4738-ad83-65b31fed774d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187308,"FileName":"afbbd9f7-9136-4af2-a210-109576ed3134.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187308,"FileName":"1758fc52-eb28-4a98-922a-0aeb401038a1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187308,"FileName":"62a0f9e3-8180-45ab-a83f-228b63ff60a9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197730,"Name":"Houkago wa Betsu no Kao","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"UCom","Publisher":"UCom","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197730,"FileName":"d1ceb6c7-37d6-447f-acd8-eaba24927595.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197730,"FileName":"9cfc438f-a957-4015-bd9f-645fbe1a151f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197730,"FileName":"e66cf078-722e-4b08-a883-31a8bce0913c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188838,"Name":"Houou no Gotoku: Ranse no Hasha Nobunaga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188838,"FileName":"4288b183-b209-4b83-902c-daf1b452df77.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188838,"FileName":"f2c4b06f-0b63-4c5e-bf50-48419d41b533.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188838,"FileName":"85e0be88-13f4-47c3-88c2-238b371161d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188838,"FileName":"cb307e70-fb7d-4c10-9f4d-5c373bfbb10c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188838,"FileName":"812338fb-c6d9-45cb-b7cd-4a263207eea4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203666,"Name":"Houtei Raoyui II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The sequel to Mahjong Houtei Raoyui has the same concept and gameplay as its predecessor.

Will she be able to reclaim him for herself - and if so, by what means?..\nThe gameplay in IF 2 is similar to that of the previous game, though the branching story line concept is somewhat deeper and more complicated. There are more choices to make, and they have a more significant impact on the development on the story. Particularly the second episode is notable for being more open-ended, but also unforgiving and leading to premature endings if the player doesn't choose the right things to do and/or to say.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"Active Software","Publisher":"Active Software","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187313,"FileName":"b93b8da1-49f0-4775-a94d-00136dbb9c1d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187313,"FileName":"d52831a2-475a-4efe-96f6-d82045e2731d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187313,"FileName":"2358b1a0-d2bd-44fc-828d-b5965255767e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187314,"Name":"if 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Like its predecessors in the series, IF 3 contains three scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played directly from the main menu:\nThe first episode, sub-titled Will for Suicide, is indeed about that: a person who tries to commit suicide.

Hong Kong was most affected by the mysterious demonic attack. Terrible diseases turned the once prosperous city into a pale shadow of itself. But once people came back to see what happened to the isolated city, they saw it was ruled by a new order - a corporation called SIVA. The new order proclaimed New Hong Kong to be an independent state. People's Republic of China and United Kingdom signed an agreement in which they both renounced their claims over the city.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Tianren, a \"diver\" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong, he was brought up in the house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the supernatural beings from Chinese myths.\n\nIllusion City is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike most games of the genre, it has no overworld, and takes place entirely in a vast city divided into several districts. The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.\n\nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.\n\nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"9b0cd8bd-2c1f-491d-aa0f-ad5929b28aa9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"d56508d9-cdbe-4fee-a047-97f360f62e6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"f640845c-2cdd-49df-90f2-ea228694e990.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"0f1c81b4-4d29-4395-b9a6-246346ffcc71.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"dc0d2a1f-1abe-4122-810b-b8b3cf665d90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"04382146-c5e0-4c33-a515-b92efe4ed9f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"f0575596-678a-4259-9a7b-a05affa53c02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182549,"FileName":"376b4e81-2f73-436e-a866-ef1ec4f7d531.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182549,"AlternateName":"Illusion City","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189415,"Name":"Imadoki Junjou Monogatari","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Our hero wakes up in a hospital full of pretty nurses after an accident.

All the three episodes are set in medieval/fantasy environment.\nThe first episode tells of a \"cursed\" treasure room somewhere on the outskirts of a town; the only one brave enough to venture there is a young hero named Recardo. In scenario A, Recardo has to find a way to defeat a demon, using objects from the treasure room; in scenario B, he has to face a female demonic creature and seduce her without getting killed in the process. Scenario A has a large turn-based battle that can be lost; the key to winning is usage of items.\n\nThe second episode stars the fighter Rush and his female companion Femir; traveling across the desert, they enter a town, and Rush decides to participate in a fighter competition. This episode differs from the other ones (and most other Japanese-style adventures) by having free movement in top-down environment. Scenario A puts the player into Rush's role; the gameplay here contains slight, mini-game-like elements of role-playing, as Rush has to win turn-based battles, gain money, and buy better weapons, equipment, and items to survive. In Scenario B, the player controls Femir. While Rush is fighting his battles, Femir investigates a strange disappearance of female warriors.\n\nThe third episode is the most traditional one, both from the point of view of story and gameplay. This rather minimalistic episode depicts a meeting between the young boy Fand and the girl Remia, who is from another town. Fand shows her around, the two have a date, and the rest of the episode evolves according to the player's decisions for both characters (Fand in Scenario A, Remia in Scenario B).\nThe gameplay is similar to the one implemented in the first game, with the exception of the episode-specific enhancements described above. Most of the time the player has several verbs at his disposal, sometimes with object sub-menus. Sex scenes are usually handled via a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verb commands.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Software House Parsley","Publisher":"Software House Parsley","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183358,"FileName":"0f65d79b-3d1b-4d4d-8f1b-4f08621deac8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183358,"FileName":"7d881dd6-62d6-44e8-a025-5b80eccc448e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183358,"FileName":"4639dade-c470-4b7a-acc1-90af46538845.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183359,"Name":"Image Room: Banana Club","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Protagonist wanders the Christmas night town without money and in desperation till a flier of Banana Club flies in his face.

The child, who was named Masaya, grew up on the Earth and turned to be a normal teenager, unaware of the magical powers sealed within him - until a messenger from Irium appears on the Earth and tells him that their world is in great trouble, and he is the only one who can save it...\n\nDespite heavy amounts of text, dialogues, and an adventure-like interface (with a menu of verb commands) for all the locations except the dungeons, Irium is still a RPG in its core, more specifically a first-person dungeon crawler. The player controls a party consisting of Masaya and up to three female companions. The dungeons are identically-looking pseudo-3D mazes (with an auto-map), which have to be explored and safely traversed to reach the destination dictated by the story. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. Some of the characters learn offensive and supportive magic, used in combat or outside of it.\n\nThere are sex scenes in the game, all of them rather \"softcore\" (comparable to those seen in Knight of Xentar or other Elf games). The player has no control over their outcome, but has to select menu commands to advance.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Orange House","Publisher":"Orange House","ReleaseDate":"1993-06-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187328,"FileName":"1186fb8d-6fc9-4533-8cb9-2561cad03b14.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187328,"FileName":"183759fe-a4d5-4096-9f7a-787639920207.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187328,"FileName":"7fed2327-b7a4-4d28-a04c-c9eeef9e23ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187328,"FileName":"91b4fd70-4c67-480b-a127-aba0dac167e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187328,"FileName":"571c1128-f3fb-4977-ab70-b2125e66702e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187328,"FileName":"003dfd43-420b-4d0a-92fe-e9b18a09e23d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189627,"Name":"Irokazu Koujou Iinkai for Adult Dai-5-shuu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Irokazu Koujou Iinkai for Adult Dai-5-Shuu is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Arkham Products, which was released in Japan in 1994.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Arkham Products","Publisher":"Arkham Products","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179175,"Name":"Isaku","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kenta is an ordinary Japanese teenager who enjoys his high school life.

When Kenta realizes they were lured there, it is already too late - they are locked in the building, unable to get out.

The gameplay mostly involves exploring the rooms and collecting the necessary information or items to unlock new areas.\n\nThe player is also able to make decisions during the gameplay concerning Kenta's relationship with the various female characters. Depending on these decisions, Kenta will be able to become romantically involved with a girl of the player's choice.\n\nThe adult scenes in the game are very rare and occur only during the ending sequence, or in case Kenta allows one of the girls to be directly captured by the evil mastermind behind their imprisonment.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179175,"FileName":"bfea6a1d-e424-4dff-98bc-3922a52bca49.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179175,"FileName":"b85efd1d-d3fa-485c-ab8d-1b1281295271.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179175,"FileName":"60970e70-9780-4aa5-b7a8-db91abcd498b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179175,"FileName":"95105b2e-bc16-4419-af7b-f725677ef388.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187329,"Name":"Ishidō: The Way of Stones","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ishido is a solitaire board game played with tiles, similar to Shanghai.

In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.\n\nThis strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187331,"FileName":"4a53bf88-32bd-4fa3-9d34-6b3582d36949.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187331,"FileName":"8a460fbc-db33-4234-89f7-cdf7a9d53783.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187331,"FileName":"421369c7-a40d-41ea-bfe7-72d782a2bd4c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187331,"FileName":"14f6ff86-16e3-4be7-8be1-c2c133ac21a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189439,"Name":"Island of Myth","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Nippon Softech","Publisher":"Nippon Softech","ReleaseDate":"1992-04-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189439,"FileName":"a838fa61-6289-4888-9ebd-732979c3cfa0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189439,"FileName":"247e6419-87e3-45bf-a722-816cde55dbea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189439,"FileName":"bb69384d-732e-4b66-bf43-743e9c9ee8b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189440,"Name":"J.

The player can choose between any of the three scenarios, taking place during the fictional 10th to 12th centuries of Joshua's history.

Much of the interaction is menu-driven, as the player conducts interior policies, diplomacy, and military actions of the controlled state. As the ruler of a nation, the player has to keep the population happy, fortify cities, construct catapults for protection, train soldier, supply money and rations to the army, and engage in large-scale turn-based battles that take place on separate overhead screens.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Panther Software Inc.","Publisher":"Panther Software Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183677,"FileName":"c8115695-97b0-4fc5-957a-0d1f87c8e2a9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183677,"FileName":"318fc585-3d8f-4906-bfc2-2f598b10adf9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183677,"FileName":"584fb283-8aac-419c-84ac-98bd001d51cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183677,"AlternateName":"Isekai Denshou Joshua","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189442,"Name":"Jotunn","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"XAIN Soft","Publisher":"XAIN Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189442,"FileName":"339f5b3f-fbca-41c1-8f91-caf10e67e724.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189442,"FileName":"b5418f8f-e4d9-47ea-b3cb-b0c5fad9b017.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189442,"FileName":"8b43f751-6798-44cb-8390-845ddeea1317.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189442,"FileName":"5305ced7-8e2a-4379-aed6-3e2fbeab5676.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189443,"Name":"Juushin Rogus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/JuVjFxiW5OI","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189443,"FileName":"e9a50d54-a224-4fd2-9a10-9f3926df8deb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189443,"FileName":"65e6c85d-0540-4a4e-a102-7c2d99676f62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189443,"FileName":"96c8aafd-da2a-478d-8510-06eab1d00f03.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189443,"FileName":"e096a088-d03e-4c24-ba81-9078cc329ebe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187380,"Name":"JYB","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game's hero, a young man named Otomegawa, encounter Chururu, a cheerful female magical creature, who accidentally curses him to become a woman.

There is no RPG system or character growth of any kind. All the battles are pre-set and dictated by the plot. There is no movement on the battle screen. Typically, the party of five heroes must fight several waves of enemies. The heroes have different parameters, but use the same techniques. Special attacks require Special Points (SP), which are gradually restored as the battle progresses. In the beginning of any battle, the player has to choose one of the characters and can only control him/her; it is possible to switch to another character only if the first one dies. There are also battles in vehicles, unique for each character; however, they follow the exact same pattern. Most of the game is spent repeatedly clicking on the characters' portraits in different order to advance the dialogue. There are some \"Yes/No\" decisions, but in many cases the game will only \"agree\" with whatever decision advances the plot. During a few segments, it is also possible to interact with the environment through a typical Japanese command menu (\"Look\", \"Move\", etc.).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Family Soft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Family Soft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181667,"FileName":"a575127a-0427-4352-a10e-a3c9a48327ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181667,"FileName":"5ecb2415-42ba-44e2-b6cb-8b03790b86af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181667,"FileName":"ce78270e-70be-4543-94c7-b81ce97a7439.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181667,"FileName":"67ac0a48-da0c-4485-a4a1-eaeec9a78ef9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181667,"FileName":"deee9c51-1d27-4b22-9f50-6867682fb610.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181667,"FileName":"445cdeae-40b9-453b-80df-49b3db532bca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":181667,"AlternateName":"Kagaku Ninjatai Gatchaman Taose!

Now Ryoko trains to become the best martial artist, taking on the best fighters in the country...\n\nKakutō Musume is structured like a fighting game, but in reality it is primarily a turn-based card game. The game has two modes, Story and Exhibition. The story mode allows the player to control Ryoko between the cut scenes, fighting female opponents as dictated by the story. The exhibition mode allows the player to fight controlling any of the characters that appear in the story mode.\n\nThe fights are always one-on-one. The player is dealt a deck of five cards, each representing a certain fighting move (attack, defense, heal, etc.). cards of the same type can be used in an accumulative way, increasing their effect. Attack moves also require the player to stop a rotating list of moves to select a specific move. Winning two rounds leads to victory and continuation of the story.\n\nBetween the fights, the actual protagonist of the game (Ryoko's male manager) usually has sex with the defeated girls. The sex scenes are built like a mini-game, in which the player is required to reach a girl's \"pleasure bar\" by repeatedly tapping a button (or clicking the mouse).

During the summer break, Kentarou has been working in a restaurant, run by a relative of his family. Now the summer is over, so Kentarou can finally get his salary and prepare for the school season that is about to begin. With some money in his pocket, and plenty of interest towards representatives of the fairer sex, the boy is determined to make this school year memorable...\n\nThe game is a so-called love adventure, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game with a heavy emphasis on dating, similar to Dōkyūsei, another popular game of that kind by Elf. The word \"kakyūsei\" means \"student(s) from a lower grade\", which in its turn means that younger girls are the primary \"dating focus\" of the game. However, it is also possible to date other women beside the hero's schoolmates, including even a teacher.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dōkyūsei: the player navigates Kentarou through the top-down city, visiting locations that are presented as still screens viewed from first-person perspective. The game has an internal clock, and each visit advances it, so that the number of activities that can be done during one day is limited. Kentarou must usually wait for the next weekend or vacation to be able to explore the city freely.\n\nThe game offers a considerable amount of freedom in exploration, and the possibility to visit diverse locations, such as museum, cinema, parks, game arcades, etc. Kentarou can earn and pend money, buying items that can be given to a girl on a date. The dating mechanics, however, are not very complex, mostly involving being at the right place at the right time, and choosing appropriate answers to impress the girl.\n\nThe game features scenes with nudity and sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"d0a78254-63b8-4489-8700-4b9c8b817a20.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"4e29f66f-dab8-4d52-99bd-49ca77817bc9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"afe4d462-b1bd-48a2-ad92-a9dd3b47ea01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"12ff63ef-4b83-468f-8c6c-5c42444f9dba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"0834f8e8-b3ee-438a-b822-0a96b45c91d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"27c86367-5a5c-4b45-a02b-b6866b2affdc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"76cfc45d-9fb5-4d23-b3e1-b843640554e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187384,"FileName":"d9f41435-0e9f-4f80-9218-76036ab94f98.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181670,"Name":"Kami no Machi","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Kami no Machi is an Adventure game, published by Panther Software, which was released in Japan in 1989","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Panther Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181670,"FileName":"6bbf9a36-3c5f-4e1e-88f7-c86692dca19c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181670,"FileName":"4b461c39-954d-4237-8862-03458ef38046.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181670,"FileName":"210900d2-efd2-41bb-8d6e-fe28e2b84bb4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181670,"FileName":"c548ba81-1b8b-4654-8b5f-4d927af19fdf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181670,"FileName":"b6f82142-1f99-4a9d-b546-c39e941a4ad2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181672,"Name":"Kamigami no Daichi: Kojiki Gaiden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kamigami no Daichi: Kojiki Gaiden is a Role-Playing game, published by Koei, which was released in Japan in 1993.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181672,"FileName":"c8b98d4a-1de4-4dc7-a7f8-6979a45bf62e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181672,"FileName":"08992724-69ff-45f6-a9c6-219aa7a0313d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181672,"FileName":"ff8a79bc-0a69-4822-b9b2-bc1dbde03d81.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181672,"FileName":"a18a6e1e-76a1-410e-8a1b-68f266016576.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190803,"Name":"Kanako","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kanako is a young woman who has just graduated from college and is in a desperate need of a job.

Unlike the first game, the protagonist is not inherently evil here. It is possible to make choices and decide whether he should save the victims or join the torturers. The game keeps track of the hero's alignment, from \"demonic\" to \"angelic\" and anything in between.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Dynamic Production","Publisher":"Dynamic Production","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183422,"FileName":"8c756866-2a40-479e-8603-83253c07b303.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183422,"FileName":"32855409-262d-43e1-807c-d485745e8531.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183422,"FileName":"ff8cd400-0069-44d6-86e0-44adb73d62e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183422,"AlternateName":"Kekkou Kamen 2","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183422,"AlternateName":"Kekkō Kamen 2: O-Shioki Densetsu no Maki","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183421,"Name":"Kekkou Kamen: Oshioki Paradise no Maki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"When a Japanese game's title includes a word that can be understood as \"corporal punishment\" (shioki), it's not hard to guess the theme of the \"story\".

As the protagonist arrives at the school, he quickly attends to his \"duties\". However, the sadist's efforts are thwarted by a mysterious, masked, completely naked woman. The player's job is to make sure this won't happen again - which means defeating the super-heroine, and continuing to torture young girls...\n\nKekkou Kamen has elements of adventure and simulation. The player navigates the \"hero\" through top-down school grounds. Items (mostly instruments of torture) can be collected. When the protagonist is able to capture a victim, he proceeds to torture her; the player is then presented with a point-and-click interface. From time to time, turn-based battles will ensue; however, they are built more like dialogue choices rather than real RPG or strategic fights: the player has to find the right combination of various attacks and the adversary's body parts in order to inflict damage. The simulation element is evident in the detailed torture interaction and in the game's keeping track of the protagonist's \"advancements\" with his victims and opponents.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Dynamic Production","Publisher":"Dynamic Production","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183421,"FileName":"fd20a71d-c682-404d-811e-afff4140a9b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183421,"FileName":"270d1dfd-120c-4cbe-aa60-eaf196e44e58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183421,"FileName":"c9cfa025-76d7-4334-9eec-4aedc939c601.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183421,"AlternateName":"Kekkou Kamen","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183421,"AlternateName":"Kekkō Kamen: O-Shioki Paradise no Maki","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189921,"Name":"Kerakeraboshi","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Hero attends a marginal boys school, hangs out with his friend Tamaki and likes to peep at top class girls school in the neighborhood.

It is possible to build hotels, schools, parks, factories, and other types of urban scenery.\n\nThe key plot element of the movie - the series' trademark giant mechas known as Labors mysteriously going rogue - is also used for gameplay purposes.

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183363,"FileName":"258586c7-c9c7-495d-8fae-e4ebcd77258a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183363,"FileName":"bc20e8f1-5a44-4f8d-b3f5-73ca4a504218.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183363,"FileName":"b2f3b76f-6adc-4e6e-a8c7-682408b8766f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183363,"FileName":"c7ed2dcd-a4e9-4c11-873e-4e5ed6918388.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183363,"FileName":"9f324066-0db6-441c-a402-52357700be4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183363,"FileName":"4d83779c-2896-479b-beb0-1f3afee13f5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183363,"AlternateName":"King's Bounty","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183364,"Name":"King's Dungeon","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"King's Dungeon is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Soft Plan, which was released in Japan in 1992","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183364,"FileName":"994f3d04-8154-4b11-bbd6-7c43056bf70c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183364,"FileName":"fec3e8bd-334b-4585-9df7-4b7763b7aca4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183364,"FileName":"064e6151-ebac-4db9-b19e-4180f3dc9ffe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183365,"Name":"King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line Japan, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-09T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183365,"FileName":"3ba700d8-8f9c-4aa7-a93b-a55b1aec960f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183365,"FileName":"25ad0447-d36c-4db4-8641-842677dac6f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183365,"FileName":"59b4e8a2-a7b4-46e6-aaff-100cc912f2ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183365,"FileName":"004fdff6-43bf-4699-a0fb-7863b6a238a9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183365,"FileName":"b86908d5-7273-4c5c-99c6-8ec95c176625.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183365,"FileName":"6e32a411-43f9-4944-8da5-f5b4468d5a19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183365,"AlternateName":"King's Quest V","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":197744,"Name":"Kinki Taboo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Succubus","Publisher":"Succubus","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197744,"FileName":"59c045cc-2a40-4a0f-9648-89e318c8fcfb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197744,"FileName":"8b44dfc8-d807-4a54-b13d-cfd4465db618.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197744,"FileName":"d3d34a66-d63a-4ba2-aee4-23064ad8e02e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189606,"Name":"Kirakira Megami Sensei!","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"Birdy Soft","Publisher":"Birdy Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"a4468c61-512f-4b35-b067-9175a7b0edce.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"b9fef81d-f711-4561-b98a-48c1d1a6b1b9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"c77b854d-cebb-498b-bd80-eef53a8fd842.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"ba210ee1-7a99-485c-b52e-1ac7575389de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"32c5e2a7-5b15-4757-9fbe-dbaa1514a43b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"ddfd055d-ea50-4d0e-8150-78f3e73bff6b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189606,"FileName":"e6cfa35f-9814-4dbd-bc2a-5ca31788e642.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187389,"Name":"Kirishima Shinryoushitsu no Gogo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kyoko is a young woman who does some counseling in a high school; she must talk to people, listen to their problems, and try to solve them.

Beast. In the future, the Earth is split in two halves. Humans control the Southern hemisphere, while the Northern one is inhabited by various half-human, half-beast tribes. The humans want to conquer the lands of the half-beasts and to possess their sacred statues called jinn. The game begins when the three main heroes, the half-beasts Wan Dabadatta (\"Derbard\" in English anime translation), Bud Mint, and the mermaid Mei Mer have already met each other. They found themselves in the Saihate tower, when the two human warriors V-Darn and V-Sion, accompanied by the imp Akumako, attack the tower and try to capture the heroes, who must now escape and eventually stop the humans' evil plans for world domination.\n\nKO Seiki Beast Sanjūshi: Gaia no Fukkatsu can be described as a \"light\" Japanese RPG. There are no weapons or armor the heroes can equip, very few \"friendly\" areas, and almost no NPC interaction; the game mostly consists of long crawls through maze-like top-down locations. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based combat on an isometric battle screen. The heroes (up to four in a party) can use magical attacks, and later also gain access to magic spells and \"beast transformation\" abilities. Instead of shops that sell items, there are machines for the same purposes found inside the dungeon-like areas.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Matrix","Publisher":"Matrix","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179045,"FileName":"4c4c1786-25d1-46d9-b4a9-9c169730c9b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179045,"FileName":"6726aba5-b26e-442f-a617-1a3395e1d99a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179045,"FileName":"b62a0493-3062-4167-b9a2-458a251c8716.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179045,"FileName":"fe094550-578c-495c-8735-7366a2b519fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179045,"FileName":"41bff2ca-4656-45c0-968d-4c03e5d20ddf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179045,"FileName":"3c2d16dc-f83b-41ec-b41b-0acfd9848779.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179045,"AlternateName":"KO Seiki Beast Sanjūshi: Gaia no Fukkatsu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":184165,"Name":"KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi: Rastak no Joou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Matrix","Publisher":"Matrix","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184165,"FileName":"3e20679c-533e-4f77-8937-c82142f71f87.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184165,"FileName":"40158bc0-d46f-4b5d-abd0-1136c65665ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184165,"FileName":"265bb8fc-e34e-480c-88c2-b5e87ae845d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184165,"FileName":"28c8b6db-dcd2-457a-8ae3-84ef314d4bca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189453,"Name":"Kohakuiro no Yuigon","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Kohakuiro no Yuigon (\"Amber Testament\") is the first in the row of detective games starring the fictional Japanese private investigator Ryūnosuke Tōdō.

The game can be perceived as a sequel to the anime, since it begins roughly where the original story ended, with the former \"nerdy\" spy Tatsuya Mikado already turned good and living by Miho Kuon along with Kotetsu and other heroes.

Most of the times, the player is presented with a menu screen containing two or more choices. Making a choice slightly alters the course of the story (mostly regarding the sex scenes).

Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective.

And so three of them - two young friends, Rezak and Maxen, and their older comrade Badio - started a dangerous journey across the world, to find out what their enemies' intentions truly are...\n\nThe game is a mixture of RPG and strategy. As in most RPGs, the player controls a party of characters (up to 7), who gain experience points from fighting enemies and level up. However, there is no exploration of any kind and no movement outside of the battle field in the game. The game consists of long strategic battles and cut scenes, most of which are presented as still anime-style shots that advance the story. The turn-based battles allow free movement on the battle field. Each action (movement, physical attack, spell, etc.) requires a certain amount of action points. Beside the usual attacks, some player-controlled characters can transform into various types of beasts. While in \"beast mode\", the character gains access to new abilities, but might lose some of those he/she had while in human-like form.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Studio Inferno","Publisher":"Anjin","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186478,"FileName":"c79cb499-8fcb-4f48-97f9-bc1747452b1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186478,"FileName":"f4e31528-36e1-4e29-9ca4-6b499357b708.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186478,"FileName":"bc262178-eca2-443a-8300-b29c1b4a818d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186478,"FileName":"9a0f21e7-283e-4fa4-982e-0baf3e16f19c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186478,"FileName":"7c60e9ee-4149-43d3-a852-dc8f71c26870.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189458,"Name":"Leading Company","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Leading Company is a construction-oriented strategy video game that was released for both the Super Famicom, NEC PC-9801, Sharp X68000 and FM Towns.\n\nThe traditional definition of a leading company is a corporation that currently dominates the \"corporate wars\" against their competitors. Its employees are considered by most people to be winning the \"rat race.\"\n\nBoth versions of this game were released to an exclusively Japanese market. However, the NEC PC-9801 version has sharper graphics and the ability to use a mouse. Instead of abstract colors (to depict control of each square of the board), buildings are used to depict a typical Japanese residential neighborhood. A theme park is shown on an island in the PC-9801 version to depict recreational opportunities while the interior of the corporate headquarters is seen in the Sharp X68000 version.\n\nThe game challenges young people to create their own business empire by researching and marketing better VHS machines for the Japanese consumers. In both version of the game, the player is introduced to jazzy instrumental song being played in the background while neon pictures of various people fly across the screen. As of 2011, there has been no attempt to produce an English language version for this game either through official channels or through unofficial emulator translator groups. This game is considered to be in Japanese for the full duration of the game, making literacy skills in Japanese mandatory. Only the brand names themselves use ASCII letters; all other words use the Japanese alphabet. There are only two time periods in the game and jazz music plays throughout the entire game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189458,"FileName":"17b85b74-e44f-4bd0-8e9e-ebe814135136.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189458,"FileName":"651b22ae-e6d4-4a22-bd60-7737152121f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189458,"FileName":"35bb4c03-2e5b-4399-95e7-e9638fc51de6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189458,"FileName":"6b321f93-4687-4a03-bd81-7d931dc5382d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189458,"FileName":"a50dd0cc-0472-4a42-bb70-249977e43f7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189458,"FileName":"3c2a27e6-5523-41e1-b60a-0c2a7fa21258.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189556,"Name":"Leap: Toki ni Sarawareta Shoujo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Leap Toki ni Sarawareta Shoujo is an Adventure game, developed and published by Ange, which was released in Japan in 1995.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Ange","Publisher":"Ange","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189556,"FileName":"7f602f8b-21f1-4ff5-bb1b-33b248e4a2d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189556,"FileName":"51de6c26-8499-49db-ae58-16ec04229fce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189556,"FileName":"56faa56e-58cb-4372-86b8-87c48a60400b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189556,"FileName":"dd0ca0bb-80d4-4d1a-b0d3-46c47859a244.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203935,"Name":"Legend of Killcool","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"During the ancient war of humans vs demons the goddess descended and erected mountains to protect the humans.

In other aspects, the game plays like a typical Japanese RPG, particularly similar to Phantasy Star series (the battles with abstract backgrounds and over-the-head view of the characters remind of Phantasy Star II). Characters can equip guns, but the way weapons are handled is no different from a standard Japanese RPG. The heroes roam the top-down world and fight random monsters in turn-based combat; there are even magic spells of various kinds - healing, supporting, and offensive. As in most Japanese RPGs, leveling up is automatic.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183368,"FileName":"d736f484-7c0a-4bda-b8b1-e2c595b5aa6b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183368,"FileName":"16f9ee9a-2f9b-4f91-b1fe-964c16694415.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183368,"FileName":"99e1c9ce-47a1-46ab-91da-7dcd008653d1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183368,"FileName":"bad926ab-bb48-4b37-9a2a-562e345987d7.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183368,"FileName":"7e07eec1-f877-4adb-a316-67e721c947a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183368,"FileName":"bfd87f53-b95d-44d0-93ad-f76566dd5a42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187716,"Name":"Liena Crystal: Adventure of Liena","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Europe, 1895.

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\n\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\n\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.\n\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\n\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Audiogenic Software Ltd.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187414,"FileName":"16341229-a41a-4152-b713-360066a06988.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187414,"FileName":"bfb0e4c1-9358-47c0-85b1-7bd38cf122dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187414,"FileName":"7b581460-145e-4b1d-8d32-cf9ecbebc86f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187414,"FileName":"21b5ba88-ae66-485e-9b68-5d5a872e210e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183371,"Name":"Lord Monarch","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are prince Alfred, the son of the great king of Monarch.

But it all ended when the chariots of the terrifying Death God attacked and destroyed the beautiful cities beyond the skies. Humans have lost their memories. And the magical powers from before started serving evil intentions...\n\nAlthough a Japanese game, Lunatic Dawn is much more similar to \"old-school\" Western RPGs than to its compatriots. For once, it is not a story-driven game. There are almost no scripted events, very few dialogues, etc. The overall theme of the game is quite abstract: the cities serve as places to buy equipment and learn combat techniques, but have no real locations (everything is accessed via a menu).\n\nThe game is dedicated to character creation, RPG-style character development, and exploration. In the beginning, the player creates the playable character, choosing age, gender, and even weaknesses - all of which affect the character's parameters such as stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc. Afterwards, the player allocates points into the remaining parameters. The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game.

But it all ended when the chariots of the terrifying Death God attacked and destroyed the beautiful cities beyond the skies. Humans have lost their memories. And the magical powers from before started serving evil intentions...\n\nAlthough a Japanese game, Lunatic Dawn is much more similar to \"old-school\" Western RPGs than to its compatriots. For once, it is not a story-driven game. There are almost no scripted events, very few dialogues, etc. The overall theme of the game is quite abstract: the cities serve as places to buy equipment and learn combat techniques, but have no real locations (everything is accessed via a menu).\n\nThe game is dedicated to character creation, RPG-style character development, and exploration. In the beginning, the player creates the playable character, choosing age, gender, and even weaknesses - all of which affect the character's parameters such as stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc. Afterwards, the player allocates points into the remaining parameters. The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game.

There is no main story line in the game, beside the cryptic mentioning of a legendary group of heroes who fought demons and as a result became demons themselves in the introduction sequence. There are no \"main goal\"in the game, and no plot-advancing events; it is entirely dedicated to free-form exploration and role-playing.\n\nIn the beginning, the player creates the main character (default name Lunatic), choosing gender and background - social status, strengths and weaknesses, etc. All this affects the parameters of the character, which include strength, stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc.\n\nLike in the previous Lunatic Dawn game, the gameplay revolves around exploring the vast game world. The graphics are much more detailed in this installment, with actual locations within a city. There are more shops and places of interest to visit in each city, including the ruler's castle, as well as horse stables, where it is possible to buy a carriage to quickly transport to another city. It is possible to \"call the master\" in every location; some of the masters will join the main character. Also available for recruiting are various NPCs staying in the inn (a party can contain up to six characters). The NPCs have names and different abilities/parameters, but no distinct personalities. As before, there is a real day-by-day calendar in the game, and it is necessary to buy food rations for several days ahead if the player is planning a long journey. \"Jobs\" are available at the inns of various cities, which include treasure hunt, monster-eliminating, etc. The heroes get paid for completing those tasks.\n\nRoaming the top-down world map, the party can enter dungeons, which are viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies are visible on the screen, and a turn-based battle initiates upon contact. The player can assign general strategies to the whole party, but is only able to control directly the main character. The party acts according to its AI, and the rest of the battle evolves automatically until the player interrupts it to input new commands.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Artdink Corporation","Publisher":"Artdink Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"cb64d40b-7280-449b-bce7-715cdd67a3e3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"efced0c0-8eb4-41b3-9714-54169e68ba52.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"e3d3522b-ac17-4f92-8129-73a10e94b6e5.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"3271bde5-5290-48b5-8352-94a6fcdc9436.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"ecb8ce46-6fbd-4c26-87bb-9069a011ede7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"245d76f5-c2ea-4b4c-8002-e3ce987decd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"a6f9a448-d781-4452-a488-a1061f7a4157.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"e552891a-31a6-45fd-95f2-3bf398e087e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187420,"FileName":"870ad9aa-d13e-4576-945d-698a8e051ae2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189222,"Name":"M Hard","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You're a normal college student.

When defeated, enemies turn into various items: hearts, which replenish Piroron's hit points; bombs, which will damage Piroron if she comes too close; and various collectible items (stars etc.) that serve the following purpose: once Piroron has collected enough items of a certain kind (sometimes in combination with other items), she will gain access to powerful special techniques. The more items Piroron has collected, the more times she can execute the special attack. Piroron can also jump, and this ability is required in many areas.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action;

There are implicit erotic situations and innuendo, but no explicit nudity or scenes with sexual content.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Family Soft","Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190889,"FileName":"7cf6498b-e3a8-4b0a-9735-ca7dbd3f90bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190889,"FileName":"134a418b-62e3-42b4-81b1-0447313300ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190889,"FileName":"97adc21d-95d9-44a6-99e8-ed33f4ed2cd9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190889,"FileName":"5e2eff51-cd1a-4dcf-b48c-0154a3b5592b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183139,"Name":"Mai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic.

For example, going to the army increases strength and stamina, but decreases beauty level, etc.\n\nIf Marion focuses on a certain activity, the player will be shown random cut scenes, most of which contain nudity and explicit sex.\n\nThe game can be completed in a very short time, but the various endings and the inability to see all the cut scenes during one play-through encourage replaying it in a different way.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"May-Be Soft","Publisher":"May-Be Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187454,"FileName":"1ee122d7-e4e8-4e73-884a-7ea9c8e04c49.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187454,"FileName":"a55b6495-bb94-4cd5-9637-1717fed1656f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187454,"FileName":"6fe231e0-44f7-4859-a994-3eb37c86ce88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187454,"FileName":"3d6f337e-7b14-4c88-a379-7e032b467e72.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187455,"Name":"Marionette Mind","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Marionette Mind is a collection of three interrelated short stories depicting the adventures of an artificially created young woman.

There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.\n\nThe entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no \"world map\", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on \"level-grinding\"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/PPoSTsvS7bA","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187715,"FileName":"3f1c9dad-c016-47ca-bd71-d36981117936.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187715,"FileName":"af522780-0e70-4e1d-8a13-165f42f5ab24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187715,"FileName":"0e346b6c-60fa-4689-93b3-b07c21758404.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187715,"FileName":"09f1e522-d544-4dcd-950c-d8efe4764822.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197769,"Name":"Mashou no Kao","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Mink","Publisher":"Mink","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197769,"FileName":"bdc57542-3578-48a5-8dc4-74f8bcd00412.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197769,"FileName":"051ff507-07cf-41a6-96ba-941e469018b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197769,"FileName":"6bc22029-b8f2-4aae-a860-69ec3fe7204e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183054,"Name":"Master of Monsters","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death.

Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.).

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.\n\nLand is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.\n\nLater on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.\n\nIf there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.\n\nThe main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents.\n\nYou can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sensible Software","Publisher":"Imagineer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187463,"FileName":"73e89cf9-f129-4a3e-a6b8-d716d1d84a28.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187463,"FileName":"f8c814e2-ce86-4b20-9060-6b46a42e1521.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187463,"FileName":"926b81db-22dc-4053-acbf-e39af2f43309.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187463,"FileName":"e7d4ead9-aec9-4374-8d05-7710e87736fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186484,"Name":"Megaton Arms: Koutetsu no Butoukai","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"System Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186484,"FileName":"6c54b6fa-1ac2-425a-ab3f-9a5aa3435792.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186484,"FileName":"9d80568d-c14c-4ae6-9ef8-41b6f5ba390b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186484,"FileName":"1da707ca-199f-4e0e-a4c2-d2efc1a35932.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187460,"Name":"Meikyuu Gakuensai: Kyuukousha no Nazo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ryouichi is just an ordinary teenager, who prefers spending time with pretty girls or doing nothing instead of going to classes.

Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing","Publisher":"StarCraft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"2d6c99c8-796d-4bc9-975a-d000c5c73f83.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"c5d2e4fb-08df-4333-aaa7-9554676cab4b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"7c664449-fcfc-4481-861c-8d0d2ca7550a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"8ab49c3d-fc45-4174-b2a8-cbca08216702.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"9a21795c-45d2-49cd-9109-c06e7fef3f23.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"27ba9ff0-6040-49f3-93eb-1ee9f8337c95.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"323294a8-4812-4e4d-9bb8-2c98c2080206.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"3f283f13-4751-4b76-992a-2a39144b2813.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"39b038ce-3d76-49e3-b916-3ab95087c5ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201668,"FileName":"b71923fd-8621-45a0-8820-c865fd62b8ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201656,"Name":"Might and Magic: Clouds of Xeen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing","Publisher":"StarCraft","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":201656,"FileName":"dbc64330-a36a-4151-a422-2c751f1884fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201656,"FileName":"f311f6ca-c6c6-4704-b30f-c6cd51533d59.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201656,"FileName":"0b375834-88b8-469b-a08b-6bcd03db8b69.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":201656,"AlternateName":"マイトアンドマジック クラウズオブジーン","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201656,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic IV: Clouds of Xeen","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":201671,"Name":"Might and Magic: Darkside of Xeen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following the trail of Prince Roland, six brave adventurers venture into the Darkside, the other side of the world Xeen.

A somewhat unusual feature is the necessity to choose participants (both enemy and player-controlled) before every battle, which then turns into a one-on-one turn-based fight.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Great Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Great Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184322,"FileName":"d4e16d32-78ed-41a6-92fc-7fadf2f77687.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184322,"FileName":"aa688368-cfb1-436b-af7c-753d36a0f44d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184322,"FileName":"ffc4176f-4240-436b-8f17-8164169dc783.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184322,"FileName":"cd949e34-2508-4a44-876a-76206429ed9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187472,"Name":"Misty Blue","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kazuya Mizukami is a young musician who returns to Japan after having spent four years studying abroad.

One of their plans involves dropping a space colony onto the Earth, to damage its food supply.

Each mission is shaped like a tactical battle, during which the player navigates units (mostly mechas) over the battle field in turn-based fashion.

The seemingly never-ending war between the Federation and Zeon has entered a new phase.\n\nReturn of Zion is a strategy game based on the anime franchise Gundam. The player controls the forces of the Earth Federation. The game is mission-based; each mission is shaped as a tactical turn-based battle that takes place on a defined map.

Young girls have been kidnapped and turned into seductive, but deadly monsters, who kill people with lethal attacks called SEX. It's time for the Mokkoriman to show his true face! With the help of his two superhero-aiding pretty girls, Mokkoriman is out for justice, revenge, and mutual SEX.\n\nMokkoriman RPG mostly plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map, random turn-based battles, party management, levels, equipment, and everything else, albeit with a definite comedic undertone: the enemies are naked girls, regular attacks are called \"sex\" (with choices of one-on-one or group), instead of magic there is \"dirty talk\", and health is restored by reading Japanese porn magazines.\n\nThe game is very heavy on explicit sexual content; even during regular battles the attacks are animated in a very suggestive way. The game marks the beginning of Illusion's career as the maker of interactive sex scenes. The sexual encounters in Mokkoriman RPG have their own gameplay, which involves manipulating the mouse to simulate the movements of the player character during intimate moments. Some of the sex scenes are animated, making the game a RPG pioneer in this field.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Illusion","Publisher":"Illusion","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187477,"FileName":"4262417e-74d4-47ef-89ad-55a5663a3c53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187477,"FileName":"043735b7-0baa-4aa4-afbe-b0bdc84ad44b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187477,"FileName":"1e94b26f-b2df-41ed-9a65-530c185f6755.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187477,"FileName":"e4e48398-c3c5-42fb-be6d-f440721580cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187477,"FileName":"7e634531-c987-4801-a6ce-f0fd56ff4b3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197778,"Name":"Momoiro Mahjong","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"R-Rate","Publisher":"R-Rate","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197778,"FileName":"0c5b32f4-2255-419f-8ff4-4854d2945204.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197778,"FileName":"1ffc3788-47f9-49d6-909c-0638bff647cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197779,"Name":"Momoko-chan for Me: Minarai Kangofu Hen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Momoko-chan for Me: Minarai Kangofu-hen is a visual novel focusing on a young male aspiring physician, the son of a famous doctor who has left on a vacation and entrusted the son with the management of certain hospital-related affairs.

The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by the fact that you are given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with.\n\nThe game has also an edit mode, where you can make your own puzzles given all the options described above.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185446,"FileName":"30203f15-9a75-40ab-b3d0-9c5598c375f6.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185446,"FileName":"5a24bdac-3c21-49c7-a053-a4269604dde2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185446,"FileName":"db82d683-5341-4acf-9210-dbd3d6d9c8a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185446,"FileName":"0aac50c6-4985-4ad0-99b4-5a57d823d761.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185446,"FileName":"a770d55f-605a-45d4-969d-f64271693798.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184811,"Name":"Necronomicon","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Necronomicon is - as the title strongly implies - based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. The story is set in Lovecraft's fictional city Arkham somewhere in New England. It is said that a terrible ritual has taken place there, involving a woman giving birth to a demonic child. A journalist named Jonathan heads to Arkham to find out more about the dreadful rumors, and to explore the ruins of an ancient monastery. In the town, Jonathan meets other characters with their own agendas. Terrifying nightmares, like visions from the past, haunt Jonathan. Will he be able to preserve his sanity and solve the mystery?\n\nNecronomicon plays like a traditional Japanese-style adventure, having no puzzles at all (even though there is a rudimentary inventory in the game). However, unlike most Japanese adventures, it uses a simple point-and-click interface for interaction. Navigation is done either through a menu command, or by selecting a location on the map of Arkham.\n\nDespite the game's connection to Lovecraft stories, its graphics are distinctly Japanese, mostly following anime-manga-style aesthetics. There are disturbing scenes in the game, as well as scenes with nudity.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"FairyTale","Publisher":"FairyTale","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184811,"FileName":"a19653bd-116b-4486-9a6f-ec4b1e0ba72c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184811,"FileName":"bfa33cf6-2288-4e23-8277-81fba0eed3c2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184811,"FileName":"50e9e723-f51d-4362-a4ec-465a0cba3141.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184811,"FileName":"30e90d30-773b-4ab5-98a9-7ff70fcbd926.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184811,"FileName":"0356d228-097e-4903-85c0-e969753b618c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189265,"Name":"Nectaris","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"System Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189265,"FileName":"a0e96a7b-f7b9-4441-bd2e-b8ece7baeac1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189265,"FileName":"1df3b728-0154-410a-b6a3-eca1db2d149f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189612,"Name":"Neji Shiki","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/zsaEThhcdjA","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Zeit Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189612,"FileName":"9415c6a7-8bca-44b8-b2b0-59ee65beb958.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189612,"FileName":"27c9fde6-4bb1-4afd-a7dd-f4db9a26790d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189612,"FileName":"d37f0105-63f1-4637-8331-78d4c494cff1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189612,"FileName":"90ae2fee-80fb-4471-8ccb-b021ea406351.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189612,"FileName":"ac8019ca-5422-4609-9fe4-35674e01bee9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197783,"Name":"Neko Mahjong","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Sea Lion","Publisher":"Sea Lion","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197783,"FileName":"7294d857-473c-43dc-814a-0648d6f8586d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197783,"FileName":"d637ed43-a8dc-4fdf-a4d0-daa5b0adc0e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197783,"FileName":"f3904082-0cf7-4124-bdd1-bb0faedbf160.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197783,"FileName":"9859fb5b-41b7-4b28-bfcd-c6bb5632b4fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197783,"FileName":"b5603a87-1daa-474f-97ac-7f73b27beec1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192085,"Name":"Neko Mamma EX","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Neko Mamma EX is a collection of four small games, unrelated by genre, story, or theme - with the exception of omnipresent adult content:\n\n    The longest of the games is a very simple dungeon crawler; the protagonist explores a pseudo-3D maze, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and gradually leveling up.

The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nNobunaga no Yabou: Zenkoku-ban (Nobunaga's Ambition) is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\n\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/aHZF3ipHkBs","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"4c7961e1-43c4-49c5-b595-7e5672ef92d6.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"58399a57-205d-49e3-9aa4-0d8e5e272399.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"a8effabe-9921-4621-a544-dda0b427d6b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"8f474b97-997b-4c15-a773-6990798287d1.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"edf40de6-47ca-4e0a-bb88-1e7c8d6126b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"b0f2edc1-f5d7-432e-9014-2690e78ec1bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190999,"FileName":"38147406-d6e8-4b12-ab8a-1a6992672f92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192057,"Name":"Noltia","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Noltia contains three scenarios, which are not related to each other story-wise. All the three share traditional Japanese adventure gameplay, with \"Look - Talk - Think\" verb command pattern, no inventory, no puzzles, and plenty of text.\n\nThe first one can be played as either of its two main characters - the boy Aruto or the girl Kyoko. Both are not what they seem to be: Aruto is working for a registry organization in the World of the Dead, and he has to bring Kyoko to judgment, where it will be decided whether she goes to heaven or hell after death. However, Kyoko is actually an angel, whose goal is to save Aruto from killing himself. Both characters have special bars - the well-being of the protagonist and the proximity of the opponent to the protagonist's goal. Command choices can increase or decrease either of these statistics. Wrong choices can lead to Game Over.\n\nThe second scenario casts the player in the role of a high-school student named Yoshihiko, who is hired by a gym teacher to take erotic pictures of high-school girls and bring them to him. This scenario allows movement through school locations (menu command \"Move\"), and, depending on the player's choices, Yoshihiko can succeed in taking the most erotically satisfying pictures, or achieve one of the \"bad\" endings.\n\nThe third scenario is a realistic depiction of a relationship between a young man named Eiji and his little sister Miwa. The player can choose to play as either one of them. Eiji is dating Miwa's schoolmate, and Miwa tries to understand the change in her own feelings.

Teaming up with a young female journalist, Kitahara begins to explore the city, searching for clues to solve the mystery and seeking meeting with onryō - ghosts of people who were wronged in their lifetime and who are back for revenge.\n\nOnryō Senki is a Japanese-style adventure game. There are no puzzles and no items to pick up or manipulate. Interaction with the environment is done by selecting commands from a menu. Four standard commands (Look, Listen, Think, and Go) appear on most screens and sometimes lead to sub-menus with objects. For the most part the player is free to visit various locations in the town in any order. At the protagonist's home it is also possible to use the computer to review people's dossiers and information.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"Soft Studio Wing","Publisher":"Soft Studio Wing","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187507,"FileName":"c4922ff4-370e-4b06-ae58-09a146761d6f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187507,"FileName":"fb414423-eb59-482c-b34c-59208adcdebd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187507,"FileName":"c7bf00ad-5ede-499c-92ae-4209a11dacf2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187507,"FileName":"dbeb9fe0-a443-41b2-8c78-77a81166e8f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189266,"Name":"Ooedo Renaissance","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Neo-Geten","Publisher":"Hokusho","ReleaseDate":"1995-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189266,"FileName":"92c31daf-f64a-498f-ae98-5a7eb9b951c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189266,"FileName":"eba125e0-d1ce-47b8-8ac3-08d51f9a4abb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189266,"FileName":"674ff87a-993a-466e-9991-9285a0ea93ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189266,"FileName":"20d5b296-bcbf-47be-bf52-a0f1af9ec1d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192620,"Name":"Ore wa Shugorei sama!","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Grocer","Publisher":"Grocer","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192168,"Name":"Otome Party","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"There is a short story prepared for each game character, but story is chosen according to gender and one of the five age categories selected.

The plot of the game is rather simple: an unnamed princess is kidnapped by demons, and the warlord Oda Nobunaga calls the bravest warriors to rescue her. However, all the men are either gravely wounded or unwilling to fight. Nine young maidens join forces and venture into a monster-infested dungeon to rescue the princess.\n\nThe game is a pseudo-3D dungeon crawler. Most of the game is spent exploring the maze-like dungeon (no auto-map feature), solving the simple puzzles (such as pulling switches) and finding the correct way. Enemies appear randomly and are engaged in turn-based combat. Each one of the nine heroines has different combat statistics and abilities: some are oriented towards sword techniques, others focus on support, etc. The player can build a party of four maidens out of the available nine. If the entire party is defeated in the dungeon, the player can assemble a second party and continue the game.\n\nOtome Senki contains scenes with nudity. Some of the enemies in the game are half- or completely naked young women.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Alice Soft","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189398,"FileName":"2a86408a-4493-43d0-ad57-1985ed669215.jpg","Type":"Screenshot -

Their current adversary is the evil warlord Barado and his emissary, the sexy yet deadly monster-summoner Kyuuma. The three girls turn into the super-heroines Phoenix Rose, Tiger Lily, and Tortoise Cheery - the Power Dolls - and venture into Barado's dungeons to defeat him once and for all...\n\n...only the player won't be helping them. In a sudden twist, the player is given control of the evil Kyuuma. The girls are automatically walking through the isometric, maze-like dungeons, trying to find the exit. The player's goal is to help Kyuuma summon monsters to stop them. As the girls walk, their attack level increases (from 0 to 4), and so does Kyuuma's summoning level. At level 4, she can summon the most powerful monsters in each category (giants, demons, spirits, etc.). When the monster is placed into the dungeon, it will try to find its way to the girls. Depending on the girls' level and the monster's level, the battle will decrease the girls' level by a certain number. The trick is to position different monsters in such a way that the girls will have to face a monster when they are all at level 0. Losing a battle at level 0 will cause a girl to become disoriented and wander off, turning into easier prey for the monsters, and eventually getting killed in a battle.\n\nThe game doesn't stop if the girls successfully traverse a dungeon. The player can simply let them walk and advance to the next dungeon screen. Depending on where and how the player disposes of the girls, the game ends with a different scene.\n\nThe game has cut-scenes with explicit sexual content.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Nihon Plantech","Publisher":"Nihon Plantech","ReleaseDate":"1996-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183396,"FileName":"c046b617-5c8c-440d-a7d1-ccd35768305a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183396,"FileName":"9ff5c2fc-95df-4247-ab05-49994c1c37ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183396,"FileName":"6e03257f-7941-48d7-a87f-00f9ae608784.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183396,"FileName":"0e7242f9-7400-484e-9ed9-aeda5378615c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183396,"FileName":"77955634-a584-4d9e-b3bd-d998791922a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187508,"Name":"Panorama Club","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Panorama Club is a turn-based game with similarities to board games with adventure-like elements.

Gameplay-wise and visually, the game is very similar to the previous installments. The player creates a party of adventurers (up to six active combatants, including the series' trademark \"random creatures\", such as ogres, minotaurs, lizardmen, etc.), which then roams the top-down world-map, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. Battles allow specific commands such as \"Thrust\", \"Parry\", \"Throw\", etc., and - similarly to the third game - placement of the characters in rows on the battle screen.\n\nA new feature is the possibility to choose parents for the characters the player creates. They can both belong to the same race, or produce an offspring in a mixed marriage - which, naturally, influences the newborn's parameters, affinities, etc. Theoretically, it is possible to create a party that consists entirely of children born to troll fathers and gnoll mothers; however, these \"random creatures\" (unlike the privileged races such as humans, dwarves, and elves) can only be either thieves or fighters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"StarCraft, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183401,"FileName":"9fa8f50a-f2ed-404f-a8bd-00daa247e3b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183401,"FileName":"83607795-6c71-43b2-81d6-624bbb0b6580.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183401,"FileName":"be054e46-8ab4-4704-9690-8c6c3a2f5ea4.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183401,"FileName":"6307087d-df5e-4c5b-b7e8-21a40b2efb7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183401,"FileName":"f263b649-cfe9-4072-a0f6-1ca18988ec62.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183401,"AlternateName":"Phantasie IV","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187514,"Name":"Phobos","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the future, mankind successfully colonized Mars.

Thus begins an adventure much more exciting than the summer vacation he has dreamed about: he gets to know many beautiful girls in the restaurant, and has to decide which one is the love of his life...\n\nThe game is a true dating simulation, with the gameplay focusing on making schedules and choosing activities for the protagonist. In the beginning of each day, the player typically choose an action before it's time to go to work. These actions range from giving a call to any of the girls the hero meets during the game, going to different locations, simply resting, etc. While at work, the player should make a schedule for Yusuke, sending him to work in different places (kitchen, basement, counter, etc.). After work, it's time to choose which girl to talk to. There are also many events that prompt the player to choose an action or a conversation option.\n\nAll these actions influence Yusuke's statistics, ultimately making him more (or less) attractive to the various girls he meets on his path.

To do so, she acquires a ship (which she calls Shock), and begins to explore the land in search of crew and adventure.\n\nPink Shock Pirates is a hybrid of strategy and role-playing. Rather than following a linear narrative with scripted events, the game allows the player to sail through the sea and visit towns on all the continents right from the beginning. Towns are represented by small pictures of places of interest, such as weapon shop, item shop, church, etc. Crew members can be hired in towns, or by performing quests. Instead of a usual RPG \"party\", the player manages and controls the crew of an entire ship (their number can get as high as 50).\n\nEnemy ships will randomly attack Shock. Before the battle, the player has to position all the crew members on the deck. The player can buy and upgrade the ship cannons, as well as other long-ranged weapons that can be used in battles without engaging in melee. These cannons have limited ammunition; if the player hasn't succeeded to scare the enemy ship away or runs out of ammo, the enemy might get aboard Shock and attack the crew. The battles are turn-based and involve the player moving the crew members on the screen, attacking when an enemy is in range. Attacks are graphically represented as animated sequences appearing in small windows.\n\nRole-playing elements are present in the leveling up of crew members, as well as in the possibility to explore the land on foot. The player navigates Pink over the top-down \"world map\", entering and exploring hostile areas. Enemies will attack randomly; land battles are handled the same way as the melee combat on the sea.\n\nAll the crew members are female, and during combat they might lose parts of their clothes. Despite these suggestive themes, there is no explicit nudity or sexual situations in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Soft Plan","Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187520,"FileName":"6cd98324-c32f-4d06-b603-84afa2d37815.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187520,"FileName":"57e29dcc-97a3-44f4-bf03-f89f70af3a82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187520,"FileName":"33a94098-6289-4d2f-8446-ae86aa055bad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187521,"Name":"Pink Shock Pirates 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After the brave pirate Pink has defeated the evil Temujin in the first game, peace was restored in the land of Thanatos. However, demonic forces cannot be annihilated so easily; the spirit of Temujin is still alive, looking for a body to possess once the power of the seal that imprisons his soul is gone. The king of the land is concerned, particularly because Pink herself has disappeared, possibly abducted by Temujin's agents. The king summons four female knights under the command of Sara, and orders them to rescue Pink and stop the forces of evil once again.\n\nPink Shock Pirates 2 retains many gameplay elements of the original; however, rather than being a hybrid between two full-fledged genres (strategy and role-playing), it is more of an RPG with strategy elements. Instead of controlling Pink alone and hiring crew members, the player controls a standard RPG party (up to five characters). More gameplay time is now dedicated to exploring the land masses on foot, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style. Despite the drastically reduced amount of active combatants, the battles still have a strategic edge: the player has to position the five girls on the battle field and navigate them over it, attacking when an enemy is in range. The towns are now viewed from the same top-down view as the rest of the game, and can be physically explored.\n\nSea exploration and ship customization is still present in the sequel. It is no longer possible to fight with ship cannons; instead, the player can acquire multiple ships.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Bullet Proof Software","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":184699,"FileName":"41614ead-a7b5-4d53-97da-d2210fabc592.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184699,"FileName":"e3045879-1f2d-4c13-925a-805e725d8d3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184699,"FileName":"e36f31ae-1ffe-4697-bfc0-75d24045a3b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184699,"FileName":"c3e21786-e19e-4ce9-80c0-d9f24cf9716a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186485,"Name":"Pixy Garden: Yousei Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Head Room","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186485,"FileName":"3034c3d3-31d0-4030-9b67-6cd90d6fb0c8.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186485,"FileName":"658c9bb6-f38a-44a3-8951-d920a19222a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186485,"FileName":"ab0637c0-f919-46dd-b42d-34f4355cd1db.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186485,"FileName":"874d70eb-a6a3-429b-87a6-10d93418410c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186485,"FileName":"167c5d54-6ba1-41b4-8725-3a2fbbf3282b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186485,"FileName":"b3d54f67-f936-4ef0-81ae-4a25dcb155d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183793,"Name":"Planet's Edge: Point of no Return","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The discovery of an alien craft entering our solar system causes quite a stir. When the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the Earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical Earth simply isn't there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, builds an interstellar ship. A team of four specialists is then sent into deep space to find unique parts for the construction of the Centauri Drive, a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect.\n\nPlanet's Edge is a sci-fi role-playing game with space exploration and other gameplay elements, including spaceship combat, mining for resources, trading, and light puzzle-solving. The game begins on the moonbase, where the player can access the shipyard, crew quarters, warehouse, and research lab. The player is put in control of four pre-made characters: William Dean (pilot), Katya Mershova (weapons officer), Nelson Ngatadatu (engineer), and Osai Tsakafuchi (medic) . Each of these characters can be cloned for different attribute rolls, while retaining their primary skills: astrogation and ship weapons for William; light, heavy, and hand weapons for Katya; ship repair and computers for Nelson; and first aid and xenobiology for Osai. Unlike most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points and can only become stronger by equipping better weapons and armor.\n\nThe game is completely open-ended, allowing the player to travel to any of the dozens of stars. The player physically navigates the ship on an overhead screen. Entering a star system enlarges the view, allowing the ship to orbit a planet. Though most planets cannot be landed on, a large amount remains that can be explored on foot from a top-down view similar to that of Ultima VI. Each planet is represented by an enclosed populated area, usually containing friendly NPCs as well as enemies. Advancing the storyline involves gathering clues from various characters as well as obtaining objects, many of which have to be used in other locations in a puzzle-like fashion. Combat on the ground is turn-based and can be avoided in most cases.\n\nPlanets can also be mined for various elements such as organics, metals, liquids, etc. These elements can be then brought back to the moonbase, where they can be used to produce better equipment for the crew members or upgrade the spaceship. Alien technological blueprints can also be recovered and used in the research laboratory to develop new ship models. The spaceship can carry cargo between planets, which can be traded or used to bribe hostile aliens. If the bribe is unsuccessful or the player decides not to resort to it, a fight against a hostile ship ensues. These fights are action-based, requiring the player to manoeuvre the ship in real time while shooting at the opponent.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"Ving Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183793,"FileName":"289d9561-bc0c-4f18-8411-6bb1c2306a79.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183793,"FileName":"a49df01e-b09f-4a61-9abb-61ba0b803441.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183793,"FileName":"6fe655e3-4504-404b-94cb-0fd558419d3a.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183793,"FileName":"dad2f1b1-1d9b-4e08-ae65-6247d46fbfce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183793,"FileName":"f5e815df-962a-4e59-b895-03edbee439b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183176,"Name":"Planets of Dragon","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Rare Japanese fairy tale style adventure game with excellent graphics and really worth a play.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/LhH-jfHUlqs","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"ASCII","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183176,"FileName":"0e5273eb-d51c-497a-ad64-7a07b15557f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183176,"FileName":"7e50fa74-945b-4a79-ae69-83c829a047c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183176,"FileName":"f052c62a-6eeb-4aaf-b72b-4ecb65c33793.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197804,"Name":"Pleria: The Royal Emblem","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Orange House","Publisher":"Orange House","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197804,"FileName":"f92f1459-eace-4ad2-b8bb-3bab373d0e33.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197804,"FileName":"be4d4156-48fd-4417-a674-3ff2934a10d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197804,"FileName":"0ba4ccec-9593-4a76-a57a-ed0ef6558f08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187524,"Name":"Pocky","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"The principal of the Pocky Private High School is a lecherous man who thinks only about having sex with female students.

After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...\n\nUsing Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/w4RwlqaFq4M","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line Japan, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183503,"FileName":"dea0e31f-8b68-4acc-8409-1babcb4c328c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183503,"FileName":"96e5324d-8798-415c-82d3-d30fb0375663.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183503,"FileName":"197eecd8-fd96-43bd-911e-60327d5152f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183503,"FileName":"007f48dc-4b2b-4ab3-9e1b-45ce32ae3597.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183503,"FileName":"d92fdb1f-b049-4883-86e9-662c310fe7c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183503,"FileName":"7a62abe0-13fe-4ba0-8e70-07ead06dfbee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183503,"AlternateName":"Police Quest 2","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183503,"AlternateName":"Police Quest II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":156088,"Name":"Policenauts","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the year 2010 mankind has built its first space colony, Beyond Coast.

However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.\n\nPool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.\n\nExploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest.

But not all is lost: Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for!\n\nThis version of Popful Mail is quite different from later releases, even though it has the same story and basic gameplay. However, the layout of locations, regular enemies, bosses, concrete events - everything is entirely different. This version is less of a fast-paced platformer and is more focused on exploration, with more maze-like levels and back-tracking. As in the other versions, there are \"friendly\" areas where Mail can buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no \"attack button\": Mail attacks by simply running into enemies or jumping on them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1992-05-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183404,"FileName":"e2d3321a-02fe-4419-9368-111283ea5276.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183404,"FileName":"3cf08eb7-36b4-4553-bc5b-6f2244094a79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183404,"FileName":"35238382-4e90-485f-962f-810baddaf0a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183404,"FileName":"328f39df-143a-4207-a0d2-ac5d867d40ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183404,"AlternateName":"Popful Mail: Magical Fantasy Adventure","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187526,"Name":"Populous","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest. To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.\n\nEach god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.\n\nWhen you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.\n\nBut you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground.\n\nAnd when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.

Instead, it follows the simpler, more basic template, with plot-dictated companionship and automatized conversations. Enemies are superimposed on backgrounds, and combat is strictly round-based. Overworld and towns are shown from top-down view, but dungeons are navigated in a pseudo-3D first-person fashion (without an automap), similarly to Phantasy Star.

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.\n\nThere are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"55060a3e-c502-487b-943a-d5bd6f82cb55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"68cc78c6-a0c4-4ee8-8489-6e3adb385e5d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"7c0197ad-9b31-4a35-b8ba-ce5836715e0e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"f08716c8-acef-4134-aaf2-e553ea87ab4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"f09cfaea-1921-4d4c-a252-0d079e52b9d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"1139b78f-51a4-4324-ba6a-f5375fb96157.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187535,"FileName":"8829ff5d-dbd8-4983-8963-8e33263cbcaf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192203,"Name":"Qu Niang no Namida","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"General Software","Publisher":"General Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184704,"Name":"Quarterstaff: The Tomb of Setmoth","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The player takes the part of Titus, a former blacksmith sent by the Druid Council to explore the remains of an underground colony of druids who vanished without a trace.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use.\n\nQuest For Glory: So You Want To Be A Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories.\n\nThe main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics.\n\nThe game features a day/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line Japan, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183353,"FileName":"ecd585f6-562d-4ed8-b9ce-5f5b42702867.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183353,"FileName":"e5cf6a99-8edf-4dac-83cf-058481dc9a7a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183353,"FileName":"2dd8e3dd-3d60-47ab-af4f-91403147ab0f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183353,"FileName":"c49f6d33-4be1-4f74-a284-5db85e2fb211.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183353,"AlternateName":"Quest For Glory","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187540,"Name":"Quintia Road","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The year is 1944, and the landings in Normandy have begun, turning the tide of World War II.

The gameplay is quite straightforward, requiring minimal input from the player and offering no puzzles or other challenges. The player is normally expected to repeatedly select various verb commands (such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) from a text menu. There are no objects lists to combine these commands with.

Game progression is for the most part strictly linear, with only a few instances allowing the player to choose the next destination.\n\nLike in the previous game, there are sporadic scripted turn-based battles. The sequel features a more developed RPG-like system that allows the player to distribute experience points gained after battle to raise the combatants' attributes.

Actions are represented as icons corresponding to looking, talking, moving, and using an item, including portraits of different characters for multiple conversations. There are also a few turn-based battles adopting a rock-scissors-paper system.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Quest Corporation","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179032,"FileName":"ca75da42-f303-4a7d-a989-2d7458472234.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179032,"FileName":"0c48ab57-1db6-4462-9b63-313d8007f2f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179032,"FileName":"9918f9bc-be9b-4c27-a46a-64ae40d6dc97.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179032,"FileName":"324b85bf-55d1-418d-ba9a-803688f0e2ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179032,"FileName":"ef4aa845-848a-4c7c-87b8-5d08c7b02b57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179032,"AlternateName":"Ranma 1/2: Hiryū Densetsu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187538,"Name":"Ranma 1/2: Ougi Jaanken","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In a response to a challenge issued by the Gambling King that anyone who can beat him at a game of janken will earn a wish, Ranma and Genma Saotome, Akane Tendo, Ryoga Hibiki, Shampoo, Mousse head off to face him.\n\nThere are two modes.

The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.\n\nAfter the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.\n\nBattles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"d259bce6-fd70-4165-8b64-5c01bbc57240.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"cc53bf9a-fa60-4e84-aa95-92bb67c7e9a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"5cd67515-c7fd-418e-8ec2-728e58c5c65e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"092ee268-51c4-475a-8550-d16475fd89f8.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"2a6478a6-dd60-454e-a623-ff2ec0fc56ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"6ddf9ca5-d83f-4b4e-9a36-d16807e862c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"b98594c4-c3ee-4736-b0d6-9b37357af481.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183772,"FileName":"e445bc89-1657-482d-951d-d7eba4f88f3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183772,"AlternateName":"Lodoss Tou Senki: Haiiro no Majo","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183504,"Name":"RED","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Investigation assistant got a letter mentioning Luna city and the letter was posted a month ago from the location of explosion accident.

The player can choose to go through a campaign, choose any of the five available scenarios in it right in the beginning, or create an own scenario in a randomly generated space map. The background for the available scenarios is fairly abstract, with the player always taking control of a nameless high commander with a few generic politicians and admirals to manage.\n\nEach planet in the player-controlled space can be used for colonizations. Space stations can be built in the orbit, and cities, factories, and other facilities constructed on the surface. All these activities are automatized and not displayed visually. The player can also build combat spaceships and outfit them with various bodies, engines, and weapons such as lasers, missiles, etc. New types of craft and accessories can be researched and eventually produced. Diplomacy and spying can be used for contact with other nations; however, the emphasis is on internal development of the fleet and fortification of the player-controlled planets.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cosmos Computer","Publisher":"Cosmos Computer","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186573,"FileName":"80509b95-28d2-47f6-ac7d-6e2c35cff376.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186573,"FileName":"7e47dc8a-f77c-4bf6-a87e-1ddea63c7906.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186573,"FileName":"ac39d8fb-2ea4-41ad-9123-6b5c66881542.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186573,"FileName":"3d742131-2ebc-4dc8-b7f6-3ec2ccd5d9f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186573,"FileName":"d2872b23-4ea4-4959-8cc7-de6f7321d80e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186573,"FileName":"404013e6-4389-4e0b-878f-0ab6574c9a4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186574,"Name":"Regional Power III","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Regional Power III is a space strategy game.

There is no option to select a scenario from the campaign directly from the main menu.\n\nThe game is very similar to its predecessor visually as well as gameplay-wise. The interface is nearly identical, though a few adjustments and refinements have been made: for example, planet surfaces are more detailed, and there are more precise options for colonization, construction, spaceship customization and research. The most noticeable choice is the addition of a new group in the command menu, which deals with interplanetary construction in player-controlled space, such as for example transportation routes between planets.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/zghRo1rN01M","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cosmos Computer","Publisher":"Cosmos Computer","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186574,"FileName":"0daaa541-54d1-4b54-acb3-8fdb35a210fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186574,"FileName":"3c1f1b33-31de-4a24-882e-cd11b8e1bac6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186574,"FileName":"40ee9d04-5bf8-4e51-bca3-d25fa3a1291f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186574,"FileName":"139bb96d-65b9-4229-93c6-a44e2fd92826.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186574,"FileName":"7e732b5b-7dfa-4e1d-a3f1-2e5af7b3d6c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186574,"FileName":"e4a8815a-fb61-4843-ab54-ae6547b532ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190336,"Name":"Regional Power III Special","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Regional Power III Special is a Strategy game, developed and published by Cosmos Computer, which was released in Japan in 1994.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cosmos Computer","Publisher":"Cosmos Computer","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190336,"FileName":"9b1cebbe-f923-4a88-9d86-32a95e59c117.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189487,"Name":"Reichsritter: Teikoku Kishidan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Reichsritter: Teikoku Kishidan is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1991","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Enix","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"e66c1e4f-56c2-4ee9-ae0d-dcc84c215415.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"b86d2049-3444-49a9-b71d-dcf6df15a7cb.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"ff0e2091-5f19-4179-8c76-98f8ed6fffba.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"51f90930-409d-4c59-9211-6a232abacf53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"d9760078-d2de-480a-90ad-7d1a867a74fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"e56dce78-8dd9-4a6d-90b7-13dc18be657c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189487,"FileName":"7985f897-bc2c-4515-9f4f-4d737bbb99ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187564,"Name":"Reijou Monogatari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Three sisters of the Saijō family - Michie, Saki, and Erika - lived together peacefully in a quiet house.

Most of these lead to dead ends, while others open new choices and trigger the next scene. There are no branches in the story, but the player can choose to go through the scenario from the point of view of either of the sisters.

As the danger was averted, however, the usage of androids gradually shifted towards mundane life. Female androids, known as \"slave dolls\", were used for sexual purposes until some of them rebelled and turned to crime. Special agents called \"hunters\" were dispatched to capture rogue slave dolls. Ryō Kanō is one of those hunters, and he is sent on a mission to apprehend an android named Reira.\n\nReira is a Japanese-style adventure game. The game is set entirely in an android factory, and much of the gameplay is dedicated to selecting sub-locations from a menu and triggering events that advance the plot.

Few of those are left in the world, and unfortunately, not all of them use their powers for good...\n\nTyfana is a young girl who was living together with her father, Alfred. One day, a mysterious man named Wolfgang came to her father's house, demanding a magical artifact known as the Staff of Freya. Wolfgang cast a spell on Alfred, petrifying him. At the last moment, Alfred ordered Tyfana to grab the staff. Then he created a portal, and Tyfana disappeared...\n\nThe young girl finds herself in an unknown forest, with the staff in her hands. Armed with her newly acquired magical power, she swears to find a way to return home and rescue her father.\n\nRevery: Izanai no Masuishō is a role-playing game with a rather unusual combat system. There are no separate battle screens; the combat takes place on the exploration field and in real time. The player directly controls only Tyfana, but other characters can join the party and fight on her side, controlled by the AI; the player is able to assign general strategies to them (attack, defend, run away, etc.). Since Tyfana is armed with a staff and casts magical spells, the player-controlled combat in the game entirely consists of long-ranged magical attacks that require aiming (the game pauses for that moment). Tyfana needs magic points to cast spells, which (like her HP) are gradually restored when she walks. She can equip rings, bracelets, and necklaces to enhance her defenses.\n\nA somewhat unusual (for Japanese RPGs) feature of Revery: Izanai no Masuishō is the leveling-up system, which is controlled by the player. Every time Tyfana levels up, the player is given a certain amount of points, which he/she can freely use to raise any of the player character's attributes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"4a62c98d-777c-48af-b3e9-24b997abdb6a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"87f8cfac-a127-43e4-9550-7fe894cda66f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"25b75af5-0b63-4e80-8834-d9e53995e8c3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"1168d6d6-a682-4764-aaba-660953ef54bd.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"8ada3761-5e73-477a-bd27-cc9ba7cc6984.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"36a9cf6f-f21b-4cae-ba21-508c15b0c0ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"b2fbad3e-3b73-4fb7-b0ff-1698ebf7479e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187554,"FileName":"d4e369d9-9b5e-41a0-8d56-e69c54297582.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197824,"Name":"Review: Jashin Fukkatsu","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Schoolgirl gets magically transported to a magic kingdom where she becomes a warrior","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Orange House","Publisher":"Orange House","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197824,"FileName":"52c1fb84-0be9-461f-b8ce-ba16f3373227.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197824,"FileName":"abfdeb90-35e8-4820-a928-70aa6a71d361.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183474,"Name":"Revival Xanadu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Revival Xanadu is a remake of Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II.\n\nThe remake distinguishes itself with the more detailed, graphically more advanced character portraits and backgrounds in the various places of interest (inns, temples, shops, etc.).

Watching how the princess was taken back to the castle by a zealous knight, Rune swears that he will do anything to become worthy of her love.

There are no random battles: enemies can be seen walking around. Once the player character and the enemy have contact, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. The turn-based battles have a strategy element: it is possible to move characters on the battlefield, and attack physically when enemies are close. There is a variety of healing, supporting, and offensive magical spells in the game. Characters belong to different classes (warrior, priest, etc.), and have access to different abilities.\n\nProbably the most unusual (for a Japanese RPG) feature of the game is the player-controlled leveling up.

It uses a split-screen side-scrolling view and can be player against computer-controlled opponents or in a two-player mode. The latter allows players to choose any stage, while the former follows a linear set of levels, starting in Tokyo and advancing to the USA via China and Europe. The courses typically feature platforming sections alongside flat terrain; it is usually required to jump in a timed fashion to succeed, and jumps can vary in height and length depending on how long the player holds the correspondent key. Runners would also take falling damage in certain spots.\n\nPlayers have ten female runners at their disposal. Each has her own attributes in four categories: jumping, speed, vitality, and stamina. The vitality parameter affects the time needed for the runner to recover after falling down; stamina influences the steadiness of the speed throughout the whole course. Each stage consists of the three races. If the player loses one but wins the other two, a mildly explicit erotic picture of a generic girl corresponding to the stage's country is shown. Should the player win the first two races two more explicit images are shown.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Racing","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190913,"FileName":"c3079aeb-22dc-4719-9663-b0e7b1d344af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189496,"Name":"Rune Worth 2: Jikuu no Shinsen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/LGxkvhieAJA","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189496,"FileName":"8633de04-8699-4a58-af2e-bde29af9fe00.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189496,"FileName":"0c76048c-c60e-4fcf-bf8a-233b61f850b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189496,"FileName":"e2ac1f75-b687-4b27-b10a-ce7f50e7dc4b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189496,"FileName":"1f9ef9a5-8a58-4c0d-9935-afc1f0437f0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189497,"Name":"Rune Worth 3: Shinseiki Kourin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/YMZLEnNiT00","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189497,"FileName":"b1c4fbe1-7f69-4dfc-a694-5d39895dac94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189497,"FileName":"a077ce91-aa35-4d35-9371-7c56e8234aa4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189497,"FileName":"743e85c4-4371-4f92-a331-f689e27b034c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189495,"Name":"Rune Worth: Kokui no Kikoushi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189495,"FileName":"68d20bec-9db1-4d67-9592-32c5bf7bbdc4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189495,"FileName":"e348c4e9-653a-4d9f-9f68-2ba6343c9c0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189495,"FileName":"b340bb83-1e41-41a3-b52a-1a79371b86e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156154,"Name":"Runner's High","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You control a girl with a jetpack along three different courses, with a kind of pseudo-3D racetrack seen in many older racing games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1996-05-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156154,"FileName":"d16b9f00-eb3f-4689-9e41-ed2299cf7d9d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156154,"FileName":"b6db425e-0385-49b0-a0ec-67ac3c93e327.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156154,"FileName":"a2e2c412-2f4b-404d-adf9-fb7702e5e000.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156154,"FileName":"0d23dfc9-f001-4dba-877c-c4bda9eaeeb1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156154,"FileName":"e770f413-9a1e-4089-b182-7145092eed9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156154,"AlternateName":"ランナーズ・ハイ","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":183419,"Name":"Ruriiro no Yuki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The protagonist of the game is a high school student who has lost his parents in a car accident.

A new \"Reputation\" parameter directly affects the people's opinion of you as the leader. Multiplayer allows participation of up to eight players (playing the eight main characters).\n\nThe game was never translated into English.

Like before, the focus of the game is on grand strategy — resource management, research, diplomacy, etc., rather than on combat tactics. Like in the preceding games, combat occurs automatically and the player can only choose general commands during his turn. The interface has been revamped, with a much larger viewing area of the star system and no fixed windows for menus. Wakusei Desperan is more character-oriented than the previous entries in the series, depicting unique alien races and assigning personality traits and distinct visual appearance to each leader and general.

The game deals mostly with large-scale space battles and preparations for them. There is little focus on political management within a single country, though there are various diplomatic options available. As the player acquires and deploys spaceships, they move and fight according to pre-defined commands. There are no separate battles where the player inputs active orders; instead, the player can opt to change the movement trajectory or tactics of a ship, watching the events unfold when the turn is over.

Mokkoriman is a super-hero. Perhaps a little unusual one. You see, Mokkoriman is famous for his... how should I say that... manly powers. That's why he is called \"sei senshi\", which means sex warrior. Mokkoriman is determined to make women happy (or so he thinks) by having sex with them. But the path to each beautiful woman is filled with dangerous creatures and traps. Death awaits our hero at every corner, so he must prove that his other super-powers - jumping and shooting - will be as effective as his main talent...\n\nAn early game by Illusion, \"Sei Senshi Mokkoriman\" marks the beginning of this company's long tradition of fusing mainstream game genres with sex scenes. This particular game experiments with platform genre. It is a full-fledged platformer with complex levels that have to be solved in a unique way: there are teleporters that connect various areas of the level, and Mokkoriman can use them only if he has gathered enough energy - which he does when defeating enemies. If his energy count is too low, he should return and fight more enemies (which respawn on each screen). Mokkoriman has no melee attack: he shoots small energy balls at enemies. Various upgrades can be found, which enhance Mokkoriman's shooting abilities, making him shoot two or more balls. Rather than instantly dying when hit by an enemy, Mokkoriman has a proper health bar. Health packs are also scattered around.\n\nEach level ends with a sex scene between the hero and the \"boss girl\" of the level. Trademark interactive sex scenes make their first appearance in this game, though in a rather basic form: the player has to hold a mouse button and quickly drag the mouse, imitating Mokkoriman's movements on screen. The goal is to fill the girl's \"pleasure meter\", while not running out of \"spirit\", as the game calls it (read: premature ejaculation is not an option!).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Illusion","Publisher":"Illusion","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187600,"FileName":"656b275e-1cab-491d-aece-b26b6d72de94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187600,"FileName":"59ca4a63-d0be-4e52-a88f-a340e8bc998c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187600,"FileName":"37f143e9-fd68-44e4-bea6-9b2186ae7d0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197840,"Name":"Seiyoku Gakuen Seraphita","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Space Project","Publisher":"Space Project","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197840,"FileName":"a7b06f3d-d2d0-4a04-bf61-9a8b5827d112.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197840,"FileName":"0d47d2ab-297f-4f44-bba0-2ec1131550e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189943,"Name":"Sekai de Ichiban Kimi ga Suki!","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"You are a show-business reporter who helps idols.

Throughout the game, he will be able to transform into magical creatures, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, which must be taken into account during combat and exploration.

One day he was taking a stroll with his girlfriend and the two followed a strange cat to a mysterious castle. There, they met an old man who said he was Fermata, the court magician of the Kingdom of Nyuckel located in a parallel dimension where magic dominates over technology. A great war is taking place there. Erion, prince of Nyuckel, was cursed, and his soul transmigrated into Tooru's body. Taking the role of the prince, Tooru must command ten female officers and their armies and repel the invaders.\n\nShangrlia is a turn-based tactical game. The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order. Each of them transfers the player to a different location (alternating between urban, dungeon-like, and rural areas) where a tactical battle takes place. Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority.\n\nThe battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters.\n\nAfter each round of victory, the female general removes an item of her clothing. The final result for each general is an erotic picture with partial nudity and implicit sexual scene, but no explicit images.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183430,"FileName":"482456f4-a150-4287-b195-2933d495ab97.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183430,"FileName":"0bfc68e4-a88f-40f3-bbce-08748d8dfca0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183430,"FileName":"8449eddb-1d9d-41cc-a28c-a986168d3b80.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183430,"FileName":"659ba073-7c15-474d-a459-4f22e93b902d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183431,"Name":"Shangrlia 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"For a while peace was reigning in the magical Kingdom of Hyunckel.

New units include different types of horsemen, chariots, winged horses, golem commanders, etc. In addition, each unit comes in three variations, e.g. catapults and cannons are considered the same type, variants of which can be unlocked by completing battles and freeing them. Each unit gradually advances in strength, and must reach a \"master\" level to be actively selected by the player and positioned on the battle. This time, enemy units are mostly completely different and mainly consist of various monster types such as skeletons, minotaurs, dragons, undead mages, assorted hell creatures etc.\n\nWinning battles gradually unlocks erotic pictures of the female generals.

True to its Japanese origins, the game has no inventory management, puzzles, dialogue trees, or other elements of a Western adventure. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, Shinwaden: Hatou no Shou has real physical movement. Most of the game is spent navigating the top-down districts of Osaka, entering buildings, and talking to people, trying to advance the plot.

You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation.\n\nIf you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working.\n\nThere are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them).\n\nNot all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World.\n\nScientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur.\n\nHow your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy","Developer":"MPS Labs","Publisher":"MicroProse Japan K.K.","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185654,"FileName":"ae8c38dd-9582-4286-8ad7-8750ea5d6453.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185654,"FileName":"65f70f98-75ba-468f-b899-60395f4a5a74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185654,"FileName":"ede78cc5-240f-4cd1-a7d6-5f5c3aa34760.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185654,"FileName":"15997667-e74f-4c10-b5a2-97bcc2a835e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185654,"FileName":"3e1675bd-16bf-4eca-827e-17d7ab4f7148.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184703,"Name":"Sid Meier's Pirates!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy!

It is said that people were using devastating magical spells against each other. But years have passed, and the knowledge of magic was forgotten. Legend persists that somewhere there is the Book of Magic, the greatest treasure anyone could dream of. The legend captivated Nash, a young careless thief who decides to ignore the obvious danger and ventures to the borders of the kingdom in search of the treasure. Naturally, he encounters evil forces who won't let him reach his goal; and that's how the thief turns into a hero who will eventually save the world...\n\nSorcer Kingdom (no relation to the similarly named Genesis/MegaDrive game) can be described as a \"pseudo-RPG\". The premise and the structure of the game (top-down navigation, vast dungeon-like areas, towns, etc.) imply role-playing elements; however, these are too light to consider the game a \"true\" RPG. Rather, it contains exploration segments and dialogue alongside action-based battles. The battles aren't very frequent, and can even be set on auto; they are confined to a small area and are triggered whenever an enemy is near the hero. There are no experience points, equipment, or comparable RPG system. The game contains a few scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Aypio","Publisher":"Aypio","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189720,"FileName":"26bd7620-718b-4f0e-a741-9421ccb6707f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189720,"FileName":"12932fd5-7119-4068-a57b-3932f9afec93.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189720,"FileName":"4d596e68-51e8-464c-a6fa-70a274e9000e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189720,"FileName":"158f12c9-2ecc-4c06-afb5-3fb971d8aaad.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189720,"FileName":"9802b031-70c3-4e2f-973b-2de9ce139653.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189720,"FileName":"13be19b4-49e0-4ec8-aea3-736cbbb6dc5b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187618,"Name":"Sorcerian","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-25T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187618,"FileName":"15752fbe-040d-4513-ace3-cac2aadaf8a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187618,"FileName":"beeaadee-79e6-48d6-906d-a9b20683461c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187618,"FileName":"8b3e832d-227c-41f9-958b-e7ee2c2fa812.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187626,"Name":"Sorcerian System Scenario Vol. 1","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This is the first additional scenario developed by Nippon Falcom that appeared eight months after the release of the PC-8801 version of Sorcerian, and the PC-9801 version was released one week ahead of other models","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187626,"FileName":"30847e79-e70c-4da8-8f8c-5a7d7c1a8520.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187626,"FileName":"64166e51-a154-4e99-9303-6210ff5f94fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187626,"FileName":"47eb5067-722d-4c9e-8807-9c28155ff604.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187626,"FileName":"ffb1b381-8997-4616-829b-936f3c9aa269.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187626,"AlternateName":"Sorcerian Tsuika Scenario Vol. 1","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187627,"Name":"Sorcerian System Scenario Vol. 2: Sengoku Sorcerian","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This is the second additional scenario developed by Nippon Falcom that was released on four different platforms three months after the release of additional scenario Vol.1.

You begin the game with a limited number of laser cannons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Wiz","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183440,"FileName":"98d88a51-b351-4a30-a7e3-1ed6889a2b3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183440,"FileName":"7fb47e28-ca04-46ef-9dd0-7969fa1a5c62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183440,"FileName":"916f9e25-f6ea-4e39-9657-e1f3ccc78cf0.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183440,"FileName":"82ba3a15-c825-43a5-a0ae-19c140f5ee34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183440,"FileName":"01cac0cf-15cc-4386-94dd-12c68d7c05d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179036,"Name":"Space Pirate Captain Harlock","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Space Pirate Captain Harlock is a strategy game developed by Family Soft and released by Takeru on June 13, 1992 in Japan for the PC-98.\n\nThere are two game modes: \"Campaign\" where Harlock fights consecutive battlefields and \"Scenario\" where players can play against each other.\n\nYou can choose \"fleet battle story\" in which you fight against the Mazon fleet on the Arcadia, and a \"hand-to-hand combat story\" that reproduces the confrontation with Queen Rafflesia in a Harlock-based fighting battle.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOOLbOMJBA","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Takeru","Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"3d03c101-aaf7-4d40-a4a9-7355d11af3ab.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"9c995677-4a5d-467c-8c9a-c39fa4931555.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"b7c00746-aece-405a-ba7f-0b4e3fcd45a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"73cfbcaf-2111-4c27-b926-89b828fd7f55.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"f9e87775-4ef3-4a78-a573-1382ce457698.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"c6af5d02-bc56-4705-b4ae-fa2569dc6edf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"ceff929b-fd8c-4210-89be-9f87a39927a9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179036,"FileName":"529ed0b2-a373-4dc4-82e8-4e51f30c7513.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179036,"AlternateName":"Space Pirate Captain Herlock","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183441,"Name":"Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following his humorous adventures in previous game, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room.

In that expansion, by random chance humanity encountered an alien kingdom, the Galaxy Alliance. The human Federation wished to develop peaceful relations, but there were those who did not trust the Galaxy Alliance, and mounted a fierce rebellion. The rebellion was quickly put down, but its leader, Geist Needman, went missing. Having expanded too quickly, the Federation was unable to maintain control over its territories, and more remote regions quickly soon to rebel in great numbers.\n\nIn the middle of this, an unknown group called VOID began to amass power at a frightening rate, and unafraid of involving civilians, they became known as the \"dark destroyers\". It appears that a dark age in space is about to begin. However, there were those brave few still willing to stand up against such evil: Hunters. This is the story of Brian Light, one of those hunters.\n\nStar Cruiser is a 3D action game with light RPG elements from the creators of Wibarm. The player explores various labyrinthine locations on foot, interacting with NPCs and shops and fighting various alien and robotic enemies. Combat takes place in real-time, consisting of basic first-person shooting. Additionally, there are also space-flight battle and exploration segments where the player controls Brian's ship.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Arsys Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Arsys Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186487,"FileName":"651a2d6f-7e20-4342-9e19-09697df46be8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186487,"FileName":"fd54a0ac-eb96-45d5-8a64-064c9d2dfda0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186487,"FileName":"d54a0822-e83f-4df9-ad03-e9516aef24ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186488,"Name":"Star Cruiser II: The Odysseus Project","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"As humans evolved and began to colonize space, they encountered a large alien organization known as the Galaxy Alliance.

One day, the goddess had to leave the shrine to attend a meeting of the many gods, leaving the girl alone at the shrine. The goddess warned her to leave alone a box of star-souls within the shrine, and that under no circumstances should she open it. Naturally, as soon as the goddess had left, the girl's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box.\n\nThe star-souls escaped, turned the girl into a small fairy, and fled down towards the Earth. She must track down and capture the star-souls, now causing mischief on Earth, before the goddess returns to the shrine. However, while chasing several of the star-souls through the sky, the girl crashes through the window of a young man who lives on Earth. She decides that since he can somehow see her, that he's going to help her out, and so the two of them begin their adventure.\n\nStar Platinum is an erotic visual novel combined with a basic card game. The player reads through the story as it progresses, accompanied by still illustrations of the events as they unfold. Whenever a character in need of exorcising is encountered, the game switches to the battle mode. In the battle mode, the player and the computer take turns matching and collecting cards that feature various astrological symbols. If one collects enough cards of a certain type to create a set, then the player can attack, reducing the opponent's health by a set amount and resetting the cards to their neutral state.\n\nIf the player can deplete the opponent's health, then the story will continue and the player will be rewarded with increasingly erotic images of the opponent (which can be viewed again later through the main menu).

Inevitably events unfold that leave you as the only one who can prevent a mysterious invader from taking control of the galaxy.\n\nStarcraft Inc. is mainly known for porting numerous popular western games from DOS to Japanese home computer systems like PC-98 and FM Towns. Starfire is one of their few original games, but uses an engine taken from the Might & Magic series of games they translated and ported to PC-98 in the early 90's. It retains the 3D first person dungeon crawler navigation and sprite based graphics, but the classic RPG encounters are replaced with a simple real time action-based combat where you shoot the enemies as they appear on screen. Instead of levels and experience points you increase your combat stats through upgrades from engineers and doctors. Killing enemies provide you with credits to spend at item shops and arms dealers.\n\nEventually you gain access to a space ship, which enables you to travel the galaxy. That also means running into hostile space ships that you will have to fend off in simple space battles. To unravel the plot you have to visit the various systems and their space stations and talk with the characters that live on them, eliminating space pirates and alien forces along the way.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"StarCraft, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182453,"FileName":"fed6fc09-0df1-4c4b-9cf8-a457b7ef07c5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182453,"FileName":"73fa33b6-0304-45df-93af-7764e51ae473.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182453,"FileName":"3fee4016-8eef-4556-af19-fc34b1ff6096.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182453,"FileName":"6aac7d8e-a236-43fc-9a61-cda3cde3f846.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187630,"Name":"Starglider 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"More space combat and strategy in this sequel, which challenges you to collect the elements to form a bomb to destroy a resistance force, before delivering them through heavy fighting.

In a chain of events, Alaska declared independence, and major powers of the world began fighting over its oil-rich territory. Japan turned into the world's most powerful nation, while United States and the Catholic Church were weakened; by the year 2011, humanity's dreams of unification have become completely shattered, and the fate of the world was decided by mercenary organizations.\n\nSimilar to Wing Commander in gameplay style and visual presentation, Strike Commander is a flight simulator with action-oriented combat. You lead a rag-tag mercenary fighter squadron known as the Wildcats, trying to make a living in a dangerous, chaotic world. Somewhat simplified dogfights in your blackmarket-purchased F-16s are supplemented by interactive cutscenes where you converse with your teammates, or go into town to buy new contracts.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183098,"FileName":"4db17e98-9b5c-494e-bcf1-7c140c05aecf.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183098,"FileName":"a3611e6a-ea24-4641-9284-8ec721464250.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183098,"FileName":"ca972521-b87d-4950-8660-f264cc4baaa9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183098,"FileName":"bdce02b3-a644-4141-8cf3-5cd61d2722d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183098,"FileName":"37070d23-d423-4229-8693-b16c806fcb89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190871,"Name":"Strike Commander Plus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The CD-ROM release of Strike Commander includes the following:\n\n    Strike Commander\n    Strike Commander: Tactical Operations\n    An additional opening cinematic and menu to choose between these two products\n    digitized speech for every character, a feature which expands on what was available in the Strike Commander Speech Pack","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190871,"FileName":"400488cc-db34-43e7-85c3-b2737bf666b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197857,"Name":"Strip Roulette","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Studio Milk","Publisher":"Studio Milk","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197857,"FileName":"0a97875d-c4ec-41fb-91ab-6978ab750812.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197857,"FileName":"8898126b-4cc0-46ad-9b77-ccd92f02fe6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197857,"FileName":"bb770f30-2303-4b6c-8cdd-57511130e7e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197858,"Name":"Strip Roulette: Kageki Hen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Studio Milk","Publisher":"Studio Milk","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197858,"FileName":"0edbe357-0bb7-4acf-bfc2-9245c9345ea2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197858,"FileName":"6a6a0ea0-2e08-40f0-b16b-bdaedc26689a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197858,"FileName":"19086dbb-f221-4756-92a4-7f53c5ae3184.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197859,"Name":"Strip Roulette: Lolita Hen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Studio Milk","Publisher":"Studio Milk","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197859,"FileName":"0b58fff0-18cb-4644-b5f1-3d1fd26149cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197859,"FileName":"782bb4e0-748d-4ceb-be1d-c3beb67b0b9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197859,"FileName":"9c668eb7-a00a-48fa-af77-56f0b2251b4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197860,"Name":"Strush","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Orange House","Publisher":"Orange House","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197860,"FileName":"88e3647d-7734-4b2f-8d4a-a0bd098dc2e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197860,"FileName":"25ea1865-f86c-4c0b-870b-fdb9cbaaf5a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189253,"Name":"Suikoden: Tenmei no Chikai","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu.

At least he was ordinary until he met Mimi, the charming new exchange student. One day, being a perfect gentleman, Arigawa walked her home after the school, but was attacked by angry female martial artists. Mimi reveals to him that she has studied esoteric martial skills by a man known simply as \"The Teacher\". Unfortunately, not every one who knows these secret techniques uses them for the good. The young hero gets involved in a conflict from which there is no escape...\n\nSuper Battle Skin Panic is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. During the adventure part, the player clicks on one of the three available commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Move\") to interact with the environment. As in most Japanese adventures, there is no puzzles or other kind of challenge, and at most screens the player simply has to deplete all the commands to proceed.\n\nThe battles are pre-set and follow a turn-based pattern. The player controls Mimi. Both player-controlled character and the enemy are dealt five cards, one of which the player has to \"play\"; after the turn is over, the player is dealt a new card. The cards work like battle command: attack, defense, etc. A special card is \"undress\", which, unsurprisingly, makes the character remove some of her clothes or even get completely naked. Both Mimi and the enemy have a \"shame\" meter, which can be reduced (or raised) by playing certain cards. The higher the shame meter, the more the character feels ashamed of her nudity, which leads to decrease in combat performance.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183505,"FileName":"3b9250a8-006a-48b4-968b-f6549e5af453.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183505,"FileName":"10c57050-51fa-46d4-9ce6-7d224ca8d04c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183505,"FileName":"647bb3aa-1b9d-4cc1-809d-c2bd66399699.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183505,"FileName":"19cef2f4-5e8a-4879-9d7f-4024bb185368.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183505,"FileName":"055ff11e-2c1e-4d71-bdf0-74b1f3faa375.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183443,"Name":"Super D.P.S","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super D.P.S. is the fifth entry in the D.P.S./Dream Program System series.

Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.\n\nThe scenarios in this game include:\n\nA rather disturbing tale entitled Maria and Kanpan, which focuses on a young female robot specialist who falls asleep and is sexually \"explored\" by one of the robots. The player can view the events from either the girl's or the robot's point of view.\n\nAn adventurous scenario, which depicts the dangers encountered by a young couple in a tropical forest populated by local tribes. The two are imprisoned and have to find a way to escape. The player can choose to control either the heroine or the hero.\n\nA scenario with sci-fi elements, involving a famous female space pirate named Camelia, who raids a space ship together with her pretty lieutenant. The story varies according to the player's choice to control Camelia herself, or a male soldier on the ship who captures Camelia's lieutenant.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are \"neutral\", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered \"bad\" by the game, leading to Game Over.

The hero, an ordinary young man (default name Fukai Rei), is happy to look at pretty women. But everything goes terribly wrong. A huge demon appears, sending his minions and invading the town. Accidentally, the hero meets several angel-like girls with supernatural powers. They tell him that they were banned to live on the Earth for hundreds of years, but time has come for them to reunite and to fight the forces of darkness - naturally, under the hero's guidance!\n\nSuper Erecto Taisen: S・EX is a strategy game with strong RPG elements. The player commands a party consisting of the hero and the angelic female fighters. The goal is to fight through several stages (marked on the map) in any order, defeating the occupying demonic forces.

The young hero swears to bring her back, restoring his honor and the peace in his country.\n\nSword Dancer has top-down navigation, linear story progression, automatic leveling up, and randomly appearing enemies, which effectively makes it a Japanese-style RPG; however, unlike in most other games of the genre, the battles here aren't turn-based. Taking place on small side-scrolling areas, the battles switch to action gameplay, with the hero being able to jump, duck, and execute different kinds of attacks.\n\nVarious characters will join the party, but the player can only control one at a time. Any character can be chosen to be the lead of the party, and hence the active character in battles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Technical Group Laboratory, Inc.","Publisher":"Technical Group Laboratory, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-25T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183509,"FileName":"55679c41-fd40-4fbc-898a-bac789ced4fe.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183509,"FileName":"d0f73fbd-ae77-435c-a7d4-9e8c868ac1ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183509,"FileName":"7de138dc-d0b7-4d71-8ad1-ca09c509478a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183509,"FileName":"316433b3-4677-438f-835d-a0c4e8360979.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183509,"FileName":"c4e2c529-1b4b-4310-84c1-47e901e98ca3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156178,"Name":"Sword Dancer Zoukangou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An update to the original featuring all four playable characters and additional enemies and bosses of the first game along with an all new Story Mode.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"TGL","Publisher":"TGL","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"36f1ea46-9b1d-4f24-b213-e35fb4cbf13d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"b6ad55bf-4d32-4e1c-b178-255807104ba3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"2b59523d-a921-455b-9bed-706bcce40db2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"7c68753e-c441-4f6c-a7b3-bdf3871fa9b6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"a720e1ec-6ec1-4f2d-9613-e588746841ea.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"0fe4dd3f-d502-455d-bb35-7ebd299e590a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156178,"FileName":"9eecc924-5128-4353-b673-8aa2526acc91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156178,"AlternateName":"ソードダンサー増刊号","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":183507,"Name":"Sword Dancer: Kyoojin no Megami","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Goddess of the Evil Blade is a direct sequel to the first Sword Dancer. The story continues to chronicle the adventures of the \"sword dancer\" Hien and his mentor, the warrior Tetsuta.

Setsuna's life might be in danger, and the watchful eye of the evil Black Dragon continues to follow the heroes. The adherents of the benevolent White Dragon have to prepare for the decisive battle against the forces of evil...\n\nThe game plays very similarly to its predecessor. The overall structure corresponds to that of a traditional Japanese RPG: the player navigates the heroes through top-down environments, buying supplies in town, advancing the narrative in a linear way, and fighting enemies to gain experience and level up automatically. Like in the first game, the battles are action sequences that take place in small side-scrolling areas, similarly to fighting games. However, unlike in the predecessor, the enemies are visibly walking on the screen.\n\nThe fighting game element is more developed in the second game; two additional modes (beside the main story mode) are accessible from the main menu: \"monster attack\" and \"vs. mode\". Monster attack mode allows the player to select one of the game's heroes and fight increasingly stronger monsters; \"vs. mode\" features two-player competition.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Technical Group Laboratory, Inc.","Publisher":"Technical Group Laboratory, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183507,"FileName":"d4a531c2-bf78-4ed9-9b4d-454e8beb957e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183507,"FileName":"230782e8-d0e7-4278-aea5-8f649bd96cfd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183507,"FileName":"4ef84f30-1f9b-48ee-8c35-d6a15359456d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183507,"FileName":"2f1281a3-67f7-4f4c-99b5-bda94f3c8f95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183507,"AlternateName":"Sword Dancer: Goddess of the Evil Blade","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183508,"Name":"Sword Dancer: Zoukangou '93","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Technical Group Laboratory, Inc.","Publisher":"Technical Group Laboratory, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183508,"FileName":"d1a90917-6197-40d2-8795-12a82ec5439b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183508,"FileName":"cb961f97-a6f2-4445-9e90-44326f7a47e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183508,"FileName":"552b1f02-058b-4283-980e-11ffc45f6fa2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183445,"Name":"Sword World PC","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sword World PC is based on the Japanese table role-playing game Sword World, itself based on the Record of Lodoss Wars light novels which were initially created as role-playing \"replays\" of Dungeons & Dragons. It is set in the medieval world of Forcelia, which includes both the Lodoss island and the continent of Crystania from a series spin-off. The setting is similar to D&D games, having familiar medieval fantasy elements such as magic, races like elves and dwarves, etc.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visuals, the game is closer to Western RPG format and attempts to recreate a table role-playing experience without focusing on character development or a linear plot. Though certain quests must be completed and events triggered in order to advance in the game, the player is for the most part free to venture to any city of the game world in any order. Navigation between the cities is menu-based, i.e. there is no wilderness exploration. Specific dungeons and other hostile areas can be accessed only by receiving respective missions. In such areas, as well as in locations within towns, player-controlled party can be physically navigated from an overhead perspective.\n\nCharacter creation involves choosing a race (Human, Dwarf, Elf, two types of Half-Elves, or a halfling-like GrassRunner) and a class (Bard, Fighter, Priest, Ranger, Sage, Shaman, Sorcerer, or Thief). Character statistics and abilities are similar to those of D&D games. The player creates only one character, while the rest of the party consists of NPCs that can be convinced to join. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration and is of the tactical turn-based variety, allowing characters to move on the screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft, Inc.","Publisher":"T&E Soft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183445,"FileName":"27cc9f69-3362-4189-836a-d23d76e44a76.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183445,"FileName":"3d54ffc4-4725-49ca-9e96-d6f3d3c2b237.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183445,"FileName":"2120150e-f0c1-4de8-8a64-8be86cc6714d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183445,"FileName":"a8357ecb-470e-458b-bdc7-88d3a7f41494.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183445,"FileName":"6a66930e-4caf-4b48-b5ee-7fa5ee95e5c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183445,"FileName":"061f2b72-85ba-4a2f-9fb9-13b6709a22fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183510,"Name":"Syndicate","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).

Ryō-ōki is based on the manga and anime series Tenchi Muyo, in particular the 20-episode OVA Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-ohki (same name as the game, but with a slightly different official romanization). The story centers around a seemingly ordinary boy Tenchi Masaki, who lives in the countryside on the Earth. After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...\n\nThe game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/cNQ9D29Juic","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"AIC Spirits","Publisher":"Banpresto Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":177809,"FileName":"b3dc0e9f-3ba5-477d-855a-34224d113f37.jpg","Type":"Box -

All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.\n\nSome quirks add tactical depth: The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between.

A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.\n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Evryware","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183252,"FileName":"d7b2278f-fc19-4a8f-8ddc-a882f5dfbbce.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183252,"FileName":"2edc56d8-1c10-4c1f-804e-05860b8c9054.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183252,"FileName":"91547c7b-1c33-446b-8397-b72c2d2b09c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183252,"FileName":"127c3439-0451-4dbe-91f7-e3eaa952a923.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183252,"FileName":"19fe5191-df4e-4b5c-b2db-eb5dcba51556.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183252,"FileName":"c1873024-5efe-4a6e-82f8-b130dbf668fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187049,"Name":"The Atlas","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Atlas is a historical business and discovery game.

Nobody dares to venture inside - except, naturally, the protagonist of this game...\n\nThe game is a somewhat unusual mixture of first-person dungeon crawler and side-scrolling action. Following a simple character creation, the player is taken to the Beast City, where it is possible to rest, buy equipment for the hero, and hear the latest gossip. Afterwards, the player can venture into the depths of BIAS, which is a huge maze-like dungeon. Enemies attack randomly; however, instead of the usual turn-based battle screen, the hero and the enemy are taken to a small side-scrolling area. \n\nAt that point, the game plays similarly to a side-scrolling shooter: the hero can jump, duck, and shoot at the enemies in real time. Due to the RPG nature of the game, the outcome of the battle depends on the hero's level as well as the player's dexterity.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Shooter","Developer":"MagicalZoo","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156671,"FileName":"9321a31b-da3e-40af-b657-903446bbb565.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156671,"FileName":"e75f7ffe-1501-427e-aabf-f6aa26decca8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183436,"Name":"The Silent Service: Chinmoku no Kantai","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Chinmoku no Kantai is a Strategy game, developed and published by G.A.M, which was released in Japan in 1991","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":null,"Publisher":"G.A.M.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183436,"FileName":"91627155-821f-4859-b5cb-0bbd92868120.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183436,"FileName":"71b97b9f-0ba0-4e62-99bf-cc4f0a4b4ce7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183436,"FileName":"a0a6481a-e238-4370-aa22-733f3a2bb994.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183436,"FileName":"2e2f6d36-51ce-42e6-9264-97e71222106a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183436,"FileName":"6d99aafe-87ef-47a8-8c06-4ccd73de5bf7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183436,"AlternateName":"Chinmoku no Kantai","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187637,"Name":"The Story of King Aress","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Story of King Aress is a turn-based strategy game taking place in the world of Elenes.

Aress goes out on an adventure with his two friends to claim the throne and restore his home country.\n\nThe game takes place in a world map where players choose where they want to go. After making a choice, players will encounter dialogues or cutscenes which will be accompanied with a battle. Combat is turn-based with the players clicking on the characters they wish to control and moving them to an available area. When players attack the enemy or vice versa, the attacks will be shown in a different perspective. Combat is quite slow paced as both characters take turns to approach each other and land a hit with each character attacking multiple times in one turn.

This game is basically a mix of two earlier Macross games by Family Soft, namely Skull Leader and Love Stories. There are naturally certain changes and improvements to the formula, but by and large this is what this particular release is. It is an interesting take on the plot of Macross.\n\nThe core of the plot is based on the movie “Do You Remember Love?”, as you can see from the designs of the pilot suits and the Zentradi; however, it uses the TV series to fill any hole that the movie doesn’t show (for example, how the Macross leaves the planet). In order to mix the two versions together, the role of Minmay in the TV series is “taken” by one of the original characters in the game. This game is split into two stories: Hikaru (the main character of the original series and movie) and Kei (an original character made for this game). Hikaru’s story has more chapters, and a route split that changes the story, making it more similar to the TV series in one version, and more similar to the movie in the other; Kei’s story is shorter, but has a dating sim element, with different endings based on your choices.\n\nAs to the gameplay itself, it’s a mixture of the aforementioned VN segments and strategy battles. Strategy battles are fairly involved, since you can utilize a wide variety of units, strategies, formations, transformations and weapon types. Your goal is usually to destroy all the enemy units, get to a certain point or escort some unit as fast as possible. VN segments and strategy segments complement each other quite well, and the story itself has some original elements to it.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":134846,"FileName":"51c28060-5ebe-4e15-a17e-5dbbd22c3ff0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":134846,"FileName":"a8e7171d-0d8b-486e-ba0c-39d8e1e5ff27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":134846,"AlternateName":"Chou Jikuu Yousai Macross: Skull Leader Complete Pack","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":189518,"Name":"The Super Las Vegas II","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Casino","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Nippon Dexter","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189518,"FileName":"8fc2abb1-d90d-437b-ba8c-248f5e4975ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189518,"FileName":"f96a0f68-0048-4aff-af62-32cd4af6988d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189518,"FileName":"3863b889-8cd0-439d-bba6-48da33cc0a3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189272,"Name":"The Tower? of Cabin: Cabin Panic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189272,"FileName":"290d5d99-949a-45be-a34a-3d18a2ac051d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189272,"FileName":"62dd8fa3-d6fa-45eb-8c39-31f73a27daab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189272,"FileName":"ea763d21-0d0e-453c-8cdd-3c584caccc8d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189272,"FileName":"0a4131e8-5090-4b45-bd73-dbbf2c056155.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189272,"FileName":"aefbba89-7dd5-4de7-9a7a-4a94de4ee6a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190872,"Name":"Theme Park","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog.

Aided by a simple village girl, he bravely descends into a dungeon full of seductive monsters - but he should beware of the competition...\n\nThemm plays very similarly to Raidy games: it is one big first-person dungeon crawl (solo) with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat. The enemies are, as the story implies, pretty and female; they disrobe upon defeat, which would already qualify this game for the adult genre, even if it weren't for the boss enemies who engage in full-fledged sexual activity with the hero.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Hervest","Publisher":"Hervest","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187648,"FileName":"6b488ef0-1e21-4f4d-920f-747ef966ea18.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187648,"FileName":"47a338ae-8700-44cb-8ef1-32cd628c292d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187648,"FileName":"f7a44002-bf81-4fc5-b4b4-b992f065069d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187648,"FileName":"705590f1-fd57-453e-a745-41e79e176e0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187649,"Name":"Thexder","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty.

The game begins with the player controlling a single pre-defined character, though some NPCs will be able to join the party. All navigation in the game is done by moving an arrow representing the party on the world map or through the dungeons, which are viewed from a top-down perspective as well. Towns have no graphics at all and all interaction there is menu-based.

Basically, it makes fun of some of the most venerable Chinese myths, presenting legendary pseudo-historical characters in a comical and obscene way. The story begins as a young warrior named Li is playing \"peeping Tom\" with the goddess/empress Xiwangmu, the Queen-Mother of West. Enraged by Li's actions, the old court magician Taishang Laojun casts a spell on him, turning him into a woman. Now the poor guy has to find a way to reverse to his true macho self - but not before he defeats the best female warriors of the country in combat...\n\nTōgenkyō is an adventure game with strategic battles. The player navigates Li through the top-down world; dialogues are displayed as still shots with menu choices, viewed from first-person perspective, typically for Japanese adventures. At certain points Li will have to fight other girls. The battles are turn-based. Both Li and the enemy character are dealt a deck of cards. The player has to choose a card (attacking, healing, etc.) for the attack move, and click on a rapidly spinning additional card to enhance the attack - or make it fail. During the enemy turn, the player also must click on a card, with different results.\n\nThe game features a lot of explicit sexual situations, some of which are quite \"hardcore\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Strategy; Visual Novel","Developer":"Swat","Publisher":"Swat","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187653,"FileName":"ee7aa967-386f-4ffb-aa24-cbcae9f6be67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187653,"FileName":"4e1a76e4-1cbb-4a51-9fad-793f5a8a0f24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187653,"FileName":"6e330fc2-f641-48d0-91da-f77db0a879de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200844,"Name":"Touhai Yuugi: Jankihi Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Misty","Publisher":"Misty","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122360,"Name":"Touhou 01: The Highly Responsive to Prayers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Something has wrecked the Hakurei Shrine, and the resident Shrine Maiden isn't going to take it lying down.

The bombs also exhibit unique behavior and damage amounts depending upon the character chosen.\n\nLotus Land Story is the first game in the Touhou Project to feature bombs that auto-collect items, graze counting, the ability to move more slowly by holding the shift key, and a non-trivial scoring system that involves the collection of special dream items that boost the player's ultimate scoring potential. The game's scoring system also marks the series' first instance of score bonuses for the elimination of bullets following the defeat of mid-bosses and bosses.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4gETEv9o2s","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"ZUN Soft","Publisher":"Amusement Makers","ReleaseDate":"1998-08-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125782,"FileName":"001fbded-a8c4-4012-ba86-3280c0756d43.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125782,"FileName":"5818cf60-c15b-4bd7-8380-92e145cbab00.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":125782,"FileName":"08ac71ab-3172-4008-b184-e9d07806af72.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125782,"FileName":"d83868a7-96d2-4bbb-bffb-36acb2cd739c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125782,"FileName":"db003771-b128-4156-b1c1-752adc8649e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":125782,"AlternateName":"Touhou Gensoukyou: Lotus Land Story","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125782,"AlternateName":"Touhou Fantasy Land: Lotus Land Story","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":125782,"AlternateName":"東方幻想郷: Lotus Land Story","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":125783,"Name":"Touhou 05: Mystic Square","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"For no apparent reason, large quantities of demons and youkai begin to travel from Makai, the world of demons, to Gensokyo, swamping the land and leaving Reimu Hakurei with a lot of extermination to do.

In his reinterpretation of these stories, Ueda recast them as historical tales set in Japan, weaving together elements of the source tales with a rich array of references to historical events, personages, and literary works, both Japanese and Chinese. In his use of Chinese compounds glossed with Japanese phonetic readings, Ueda frequently incorporates double meanings and word play into his text. Ueda’s penchant for allusion is evident in the Chinese preface, which is also noteworthy for its presentation of the author’s view of fiction as means of expressing truth.\n\nAlthough each story revolves around a supernatural event, Ueda does not stray too far from the affairs of this world. Like other members of the kokugaku (nativist) movement Ueda relied on fiction as a tool to reinvigorate Japan’s past, by bringing to life the aesthetics of antiquity in the present. At the same time, he presents in Ugetsu Monogatari some of the moral views of the kokugaku school. To do so, he employs supernatural elements, such as ghosts who revisit the living to make known the effects they have suffered from the unethical behavior of others. For example, in the story “Asaji ga yado” (“The House Amid the Reeds”), upon which Kenji Mizoguchi’s 1953 film Ugetsu is partially based, a husband who has abandoned his faithful wife returns home only to unknowingly meet her ghost, an experience which leads him to a heartbreaking realization of the effects of his infidelity.[9] However, as Dennis Washburn argues, through his highly literate style and developed narrative technique, Ueda avoids overly emphasizing the moral aspect, and the tales are first and foremost a literary exploration of human emotion.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Tonkin House","Publisher":"Tonkin House","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189525,"FileName":"895438b4-6645-4fca-af1e-11ba43e58bdc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189525,"FileName":"049dfc56-1d0b-4b86-ba55-2d95aab80413.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189525,"FileName":"32eb2aa1-1a87-4284-86d5-e3fcd3646f6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190958,"Name":"Uki Uki Island","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A group of high school students (3 boys and 3 girls) decide to go on a lost island, called Daikokujima (\"big black island\") as a club event of the \"Exploration Club\".

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183329,"FileName":"b7d58ebd-736e-4973-b7b4-13c4d5f258eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183329,"FileName":"9d50dbb9-6984-48c9-9f67-102487247de2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183329,"FileName":"a3a3e371-0549-4a3d-92ec-d678c2ec513b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183329,"AlternateName":"Ultima IV","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183331,"Name":"Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds takes place one year after the events of Ultima VII: The Black Gate.

Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must travel to these worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.\n\nThis sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its 3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender, class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit points and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an interactive world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved.\n\nThe game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of its predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, an alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void.

The player has to draw his weapon, aim at his opponent, and hold the cursor over the game screen to inflict damage; the longer the player holds it, the stronger is the attack.

The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters. The player is also able to conduct extensive conversations with the Avatar's companions, as well as split the party and control the characters separately. Some important topics may be highlighted during text display, to facilitate further dialogue, which requires the player to type the desired conversation topics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183333,"FileName":"9ec6b138-2ebb-4052-bde8-71ace8b44460.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183333,"FileName":"c1e95a79-8929-4ef6-86c3-dd5e36040ffc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183333,"FileName":"297c8faf-63a0-4ee9-808f-f293ab720e08.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183333,"FileName":"13150133-8d73-41a8-a683-6ace68f119ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183333,"FileName":"4d93316a-dcd1-45a1-85ae-e73452e9c5f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183333,"AlternateName":"Ultima VI","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190873,"Name":"Ultima VIII: Pagan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"On the world of Pagan, the Guardian's forces are firmly entrenched and his control is absolute.

To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.\n\nVain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles.

The Japanese style of its RPG system is evident in linear story progression, emphasis on characterization of party members (up to five members, as opposed to three in the previous game), and automatic leveling up. However, as in the first Vain Dream, there are no random battles, and the turn-based combat system allows free movement on the battle field, creating an illusion of real-time combat. The player has direct control only over the party leader; the rest are controlled by AI, but can be assigned general strategies. Leveling up of weapons is possible, if a character keeps using a specific type of weapon in battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183453,"FileName":"3b1c16f4-3f48-4a00-8639-abb4d40121b3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183453,"FileName":"66ce0b99-b9bc-476a-aa3c-c5834b581f57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183453,"FileName":"9e8b3bf7-d033-462e-8f97-d6ff6b7d53b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183453,"FileName":"bc6e2709-646f-4dcb-bc22-57479e6cf66c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187689,"Name":"Valentine Kiss: BirthDays 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Valentine Kiss is a dating simulation game, very similar to Birthdays, only instead of \"conquering\" a girl as a birthday present, the goal here is to \"score\" on Valentine's Day.

Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple.

A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.\n\nLegacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.\n\nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games.

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186823,"FileName":"e4ab659e-c4b7-4d75-943e-b24e597bd73a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186823,"FileName":"3bff5728-97f9-42d1-9738-403d51fcdf6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186823,"FileName":"ecd6006a-916b-4799-b944-ed2db616f337.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186824,"Name":"Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region.

Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion.

Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.\n\nBane of the Cosmic Forge is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.\n\nIn addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.\n\nConversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without the possibility to travel back to the town or create other characters after the game has started.

In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.\n\nThe heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied with.\n\nThe gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events, as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text messages.\n\nA few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/NGQ4u6gZVx4","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186826,"FileName":"56721e78-109e-4d1c-a91f-2291306f4417.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186826,"FileName":"004c5c3f-c12c-42b1-9333-307a17f15bde.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186826,"FileName":"97841f02-8c44-4741-869a-f3ea3adfa9ad.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186826,"FileName":"624c8ec0-862b-4764-93e8-9c68c6d3b898.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186826,"FileName":"27c2a9c3-c3fc-4a79-88e7-fcdc7830f871.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186820,"Name":"Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna.

Like in strategy games, the player can control multiple parties of characters, which can form army units. Different characters take the role of main heroes during the game (Chapter One begins with the king Duran seeking help against demonic invaders), and, beside \"important\" story-related characters, simple soldiers can also be recruited and participate in battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Pandora Box","Publisher":"Pandora Box","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187699,"FileName":"bdc49b8b-78e8-4f52-a351-544d6bf0a809.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187699,"FileName":"cd21c7da-34db-4899-9745-e3560a215148.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187699,"FileName":"05e49107-9ed8-4d2e-b095-2de5d76b7023.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187699,"FileName":"adcf9829-52a7-4ae7-adda-02625d5dca15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187699,"FileName":"4fda5035-7372-4a99-bf27-a1d180b6869f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187699,"FileName":"e309dbce-51b9-4383-b6d2-e3639382eb51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187700,"Name":"Wonpara Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"God has created a paradise called Wandante. Men, women, and animals lived together in peace. But where there is God, there is also Devil; where there is love, there is also hatred. The hatred between men and women grew, until it resulted in a bloody war. Having superior physical strength, men were victorious for a while - until female demons offered their help to women's army. Men's army was nearly destroyed. It was at that time that the hero, named Leopard Chateau-Lyon, appeared in Wandante. He is the only hope of the men, the one who will have to defeat the demonic women and to bring peace to both genders.\n\nWonpara Wars is a strategy board game which is somewhat similar to chess, but with much simpler rules (and decidedly much simpler than the Japanese chess, shogi). Some pieces are identical to those of Western chess (bishop), or move similarly to Western chess pieces, but have different names (\"magicians\" who move similarly to rooks); \"soldiers\" can walk in all directions, including backwards. There are also treasure chess scattered around the board, which can be captured by both the player's and the enemy army.\n\nThe battles are dictated by the plot; there are cut scenes before and after each battle, and they take place in different locations. The enemy army has a \"boss\" piece, unique for each battle. The battle is won when one of the sides has captured enough enemy pieces. Whenever the player's piece captures an enemy piece, a hentai scene occurs, typically showing a girl taking off her battle clothes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/tTatMfEKnS4","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Mink Co.

He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named man, who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country.\n\nWonpara Wars II follows the same principle as its predecessor: defeat the enemy army in chess-like battles, watch the cut scene, advance to the next stage. The rules for the board game itself are more complex. There are new pieces, taken from Western chess (knight) as well as original ones (ninja). The rules differ from known chess variants in several ways (random treasure chests can change the movement rules of a piece; many types of pieces can move only forward, etc.). The pieces also differ by gender: knights look like men, bishops like women, etc. Each army has a \"master\" piece, which represents the hero and the enemy general, correspondingly. Once a general is captured, the battle is won. There are also unique enemy pieces, one for each battle.\n\nLike the first game, capturing an enemy piece is accompanied by hentai pictures. Since there are male and female pieces, different pictures are displayed depending on which player piece has performed the capture.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Mink Co.

Latok hears rumors about a man who looks exactly like him and was last seen near an old tower infested by monsters, which nobody dares enter. Latok and his girlfriend Fray arrive at the tower entrance and meet their friends there. Latok decides to venture into the tower with just one companion, unaware of the fact that the \"false Latok\" was just a trap set by powerful demons, intended to lure him into the den of evil.\n\nXak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel is a side-story in the Xak universe. It differs from the main Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183480,"FileName":"8b05d601-879c-4203-ac84-7fc1f715f34e.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183480,"FileName":"2ea0225a-b03d-4187-b4d5-de8a65a13b33.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183480,"FileName":"ea483911-036e-4b9f-8d28-b51fe6572eac.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":183480,"FileName":"ef013d77-cae3-4c6d-8733-8df6d9d26a09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183480,"FileName":"f9a2590d-a27a-4831-9da0-08c75b9675f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187705,"Name":"Xanadu: Scenario II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Xanadu: Scenario 2 is an expansion pack to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II.

It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on.

Meanwhile, Muhammad's disciples are also threatened external forces – in the west the Crusaders; in the east the Mongols. As the Persian assassin Sadler, you are given the task of murdering the Caliph, hopefully saving the future of the Islamic faith in the process, a process which will have implications ranging as far as 800 years into the future. First, however, you must find your three assassin friends and complete a range of quests, for this is an RPG.\n\nLike many of Falcom's games, XZR (or Exile, as it is pronounced) is played in a traditional top-down view when in villages and towns, and shifts to a side-scrolling platform view when entering dungeons, castles and other action sequences. Apart from equipping your character with an arsenal of weapons and clothes in order to raise hit points and attack points, you can also quaff potions to boost your points. Mind you, these are not ordinary magical potions, but heavy drugs such as hashish, cocaine, LSD, and heroin. The effect of the drugs only lasts a short while, and too liberal usage of the narcotics will corrupt the screen, or even kill you.\n\nEven though your party is made up of as many as four characters, only Sadler can be controlled; others do as they want and must be retrieved once they wander off to finish their specialised tasks. All battles are fought alone as well.

A spy of the Crusaders has been spotted outside of the village; following his trail, Sadler encounters the powerful leader of the Knights Templar. Travelling together to different countries of the world, they try to find a mysterious holy artifact that can supposedly put an end to the religious wars.\n\nXZR II: Kanketsuhen is a sequel to XZR. Like its predecessor, it is an action role-playing game with platforming elements, set in a fictionalized version of the Middle East and other world regions in 13th century. Travel and exploration occur in the traditional overhead view of RPGs, while the battles and dungeons are side-scrolling mazes, similar to Wanderers from Ys. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. Leveling-up automatically raises Sadler's attributes. Sadler fights with swords and can also cast offensive and restorative spells. Weapons, armor and items can be bought and sold in towns.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Renovation Game","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187724,"FileName":"d3e2c220-05d7-4ae4-8648-dfb0167ebf0b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187724,"FileName":"25e2041b-924b-4898-82a7-8a4e9c412320.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187724,"FileName":"4168b81b-c7bc-46bf-aaee-11a1e2d8a844.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187724,"FileName":"ef2b6e56-65ea-411e-8898-d0d8f2088ef6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187724,"FileName":"ca4609ea-fcb6-440c-a873-450c419c055e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187724,"FileName":"8a5e8cae-057f-4704-b9b8-4ecf021003d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189413,"Name":"Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku BS-896","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Allex","Publisher":"Allex","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189413,"FileName":"f9a9b9e9-f56d-4223-9f32-9504fd60275a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189278,"Name":"Yaksa","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/gK_IGizeXM4","Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189278,"FileName":"2e02f03a-9a22-4475-9a7c-c2c3eee3b548.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189278,"FileName":"7c925a45-c5b3-4e02-94e8-9cdb3fb7332d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189278,"FileName":"2d43a843-6de3-43b1-840f-fb14317eef9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189278,"FileName":"005263d7-c53d-4f51-90da-619265d4c34c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187595,"Name":"Yakusoku: Promise","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Yūichi Sayama is a first-year college student.

The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs.\n\nThe sequel offers a longer quest than the first installment, and adds a magic arsenal to Adol's abilities. Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies.

He was defeated by the human prince Isildur, who took the ring to himself. But such was the evil power of the ring that it brought misfortune to whoever dared to bear it, corrupting their souls. Eventually, the ring ended up by Frodo Baggins, a peaceful hobbit who was unaware of his possession's true nature. Realizing that the only way to be free of the ring's power would be to destroy it, the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to carry it to Sauron's land, Mordor, and throw it into the lava rivers of the Orodruin volcano, thus saving Middle Earth from destruction.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I is a fantasy role-playing game based on The Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume of the Lord of the Rings book trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The events of the game follow those depicted in the book rather closely, though a few characters and occurrences are not present, and many quests have been added. Characters belonging to various races and nations join Frodo on his quest; these include key figures from the book as well as several characters unique to the game.\n\nThe game is rather open-ended, allowing the player to roam vast top-down environments and undertake side missions in addition to the main storyline, which must be followed in order to complete the game. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration, and is turn-based. The player has full control over the actions of the characters in the party. These characters can also be swapped, equipped with weapons and armor, and use various skills (individual and shared), such as sneaking, perception (to find hidden items), unique \"words of power\", and others.\n\nUnlike the vast majority of role-playing games, there are no experience points or character levels in the game. Player-controlled party becomes stronger by obtaining better equipment and items, learning new abilities, and recruiting stronger characters that would help the weak hobbits to survive encounters with Nazguls and other dangerous creatures. There are optional ways to access major locations, and much of the combat in the game can be avoided.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"StarCraft, Inc.","Publisher":"Interplay Productions, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187378,"FileName":"83b1e225-79ad-4c86-91d4-72a259e200e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187378,"FileName":"b5b7bf31-ae8e-4951-9cc7-b74da70b56f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187378,"FileName":"44884446-051d-4198-a6b4-052d6ac66552.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187378,"FileName":"169ee10a-e663-418c-9e78-c275272ccc15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187378,"FileName":"90a477d4-7f91-4b1e-becb-d4128b66ade8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187378,"FileName":"c51fa428-a841-4efb-b16b-ff91c249ce81.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187379,"Name":"Yubiwa Monogatari Dai-2-kan: Futatsu no Tou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"J.R.R.

Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.\n\nSimilarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Popcom Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187731,"FileName":"e3bf5992-cf33-4223-bcb8-2698fbd03f78.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187731,"FileName":"ceeead26-8bfe-4135-b801-85e2ef86ebf8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187731,"FileName":"469bcadf-9208-4290-9559-33421db02e90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187731,"FileName":"4a317b64-aa7b-450f-8e87-180c34247229.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187732,"Name":"Zavas II: The Prophecy of Mehitae","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The follow-up to Zavas is, like its predecessor, a fantasy role-playing game with Japanese anime-like aesthetics, but more Western-oriented free-form gameplay with more emphasis on character development than on a character-driven plot. Through a series of choices the player make the protagonist (always named Majon, but with different family names) to be a prince, the son of a merchant, or the son of a fisherman. In the beginning the player character undergoes a series of trials (which may include arcade-style mini-games, mathematical tasks, etc.) which determine his eventual attributes and also follow his growth until he turns sixteen and embarks on a quest to find companions and defeat an evil sorcerer in accordance with an ancient prophecy.\n\nThough the game has a traditional overworld with towns, hostile areas, and fairly simple turn-based battles, many of its gameplay features deviate from the standard Japanese template. Every NPC can be approached with different attitudes (including bribe and usage of items), and often a specific attitude is needed to further the hero's goals. Money can be earned and managed through various activities. Experience points are awarded for conversations and other actions besides combat. An important factor is the party's stamina: a certain amount of it must be reached in order to access key plot-advancing locations, and building up stamina through side quests and other actions occupies a considerable portion of the gameplay. The protagonist has a ship at his disposal from the beginning of the game, and it is possible to physically sail across the sea and access any location, provided the stamina level is high enough.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-9801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Popcom Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187732,"FileName":"4f6cbfd0-0f41-43c1-8325-20b21c793a41.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187732,"FileName":"209424a2-d188-4ce1-bbc7-3f7fc27aa373.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187732,"FileName":"849de87d-7ee8-4e39-a9a8-6c8353d53571.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187732,"FileName":"b7b0a886-ff9b-474a-ba83-ec97ed9f3fcb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187732,"FileName":"d188477c-4153-4355-b86d-227a81ed4c55.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187733,"Name":"Zenith","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zenith, a self-proclaimed \"Full Animation Adventure Series #1\", is a short interactive anime.
