However, a benevolent princess from the same magical realm contacts a simple young girl and tells her that she and other seven chosen humans may stop the catastrophe. Meanwhile, a young man named Gojou is captured by the authorities, but soon thereafter released into the desolate streets of Tokyo with a special mission...\n\nMakyōden is an adventure game; it differs from the vast majority of its Japanese genre brethren by having a third-person view and navigation similar to those found in Western adventures. The interface consists of four icon commands (walk, look, talk, and use) that can be switched with the right mouse button, similarly to Sierra adventures. Despite this unusual feature, the game still resembles Japanese-style adventures in its core: there is no inventory and no puzzles, and the story is advanced simply by exploring areas and talking to characters.","Publisher":"Nihon Create","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"134846":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Chou Jikuu Yousai Macross: Skull Leader Complete Pack","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"51c28060-5ebe-4e15-a17e-5dbbd22c3ff0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a8e7171d-0d8b-486e-ba0c-39d8e1e5ff27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"}],"Name":"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Skull Leader Complete Pack","Overview":"Macross: Skull Leader Complete Pack is a VN\/strategy game hybrid released in July 1995. This game is basically a mix of two earlier Macross games by Family Soft, namely Skull Leader and Love Stories. There are naturally certain changes and improvements to the formula, but by and large this is what this particular release is. It is an interesting take on the plot of Macross.\n\nThe core of the plot is based on the movie “Do You Remember Love?”, as you can see from the designs of the pilot suits and the Zentradi; however, it uses the TV series to fill any hole that the movie doesn’t show (for example, how the Macross leaves the planet). In order to mix the two versions together, the role of Minmay in the TV series is “taken” by one of the original characters in the game. This game is split into two stories: Hikaru (the main character of the original series and movie) and Kei (an original character made for this game). Hikaru’s story has more chapters, and a route split that changes the story, making it more similar to the TV series in one version, and more similar to the movie in the other; Kei’s story is shorter, but has a dating sim element, with different endings based on your choices.\n\nAs to the gameplay itself, it’s a mixture of the aforementioned VN segments and strategy battles. Strategy battles are fairly involved, since you can utilize a wide variety of units, strategies, formations, transformations and weapon types. Your goal is usually to destroy all the enemy units, get to a certain point or escort some unit as fast as possible. VN segments and strategy segments complement each other quite well, and the story itself has some original elements to it.","Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseYear":1995},"139265":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"GIGA Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"478c0fd7-c107-478f-9a34-e01164c517f3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6954f911-de67-42a9-b66a-41211c7c2b44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b4acb0b8-b48c-4bdf-ad21-888dbed9e3fc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"38f42139-a07e-49e4-863c-6e70f5398a04.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1e12c892-5788-47ae-9365-1ec8f684009e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Briganty: The Roots of Darkness","Overview":"Briganty: The Roots of Darkness is a side-scrolling action game with role-playing, platforming and beat-em-up elements.

The second screen features trampolines, which Mario can use to stun enemies; kill all the enemies and an exit platform will appear. The third screen includes conveyor belts which can be used much like the trampolines to stun enemies; the goal here however is to collect money, and eventually a ring will appear at the top of the stage which must be collected.

With only the accelerator, the maximum speed is 327km \/ h, and if the turbo is activated from there, the maximum speed reaches 511km \/ h. The mechanism is that the brake is applied when the accelerator is released.

Afterwards, the player can venture into the depths of BIAS, which is a huge maze-like dungeon.

The game tells the story of Landschaft, a young warrior in the army or Rauschritt. He trains in the Posse camp with his best friend Dienstag and the lovely Jungfer. He is well-known for his courage, but he first needs to prove himself worthy of being a true night. It began as an educational battle for the young hero, but soon a chain of events forced him to fight for his life and for his country.\n\nAmaranth KH is the radical conclusion to the series' tendency to strategy elements; it discards the RPG elements (movement outside of a battle screen, exploration, etc.) in favor of a traditional Japanese-style turn-based strategy game with a RPG angle (leveling up). The player commands Landschaft, his friends, and their units, moving them on the battle screen and attacking enemies when they are in their weapons' range. There are different types of units: infantry, cavalry, archers, magicians, etc. Some battle elements were taken from the previous game (such as archers attacking diagonally). Strong, story-related characters (generals) can fight alone against an entire unit of \"nameless\" characters. Every attack is displayed as a separate picture, graphically depicting ts results.

But shadows from the past keep haunting the young prince. His sister is kidnapped by an old acquaintance. Din, Deinass, and their friends must do everything they can to bring her back and to stop a new threat to the kingdom.\n\nSimilarly to the previous game, Amaranth IV contains elements of strategy RPGs: limited exploration, rare and story-dictated battles, and turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field. However, it gets rid of the \"vigour\" and action points system of the previous game, in favor of simpler gameplay. The player-controlled characters act in turns, and can usually move and execute a physical attack (or cast a spell) one time per turn. Some weapons require specific placement on the field (for example, bows require a character equipped with them to stand diagonally across the enemy in order to be able to attack). Character receive experience points and level up after defeating enemies; fallen character are resurrected to full health after battles.

No side was able to control the island for a long time; after a while, the war raged anew, and the island fell under the control of the other side.\n\nForty years ago, the Light, represented by human being, prevailed in the latest battle. The island was occupied by humans. One day, a strange-looking man appeared on it. He had no memory of his own past, except his name, Dulldeek, and the hatred to humans. Without knowing what this hatred was caused by, Dulldeek feels the rage of the Dark inside him. He decides to infiltrate the castle of Veevik, the humans' fortress, to satisfy his burning anger...\n\nD'ark is a very simple solo first-person dungeon crawler. As Dulldeek, the player navigates maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons (with auto-mapping), encountering randomly appearing enemies and fighting them in turn-based combat to gain experience points and level up. The magic system is very basic, the sole choice being \"attack spell\" or \"healing spell\", both of which consume magic points.

Twenty-four years later, a special all-female unit known as Attacked Mystification Police was formed to combat the enemy.\n\nCase: Titanic is based on the manga and anime Silent Möbius. It presents an original episode that involves the sighting of a strange ship in the clouds above Tokyo. Closer inspection reveals that the ship appears to be identical to the famous RMS Titanic that sank in the Atlantic Ocean in 1912. The game's nameless male protagonist boards the ship along with Rally, Kiddy, Nami and other heroines from the manga in order to investigate this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon.\n\nThe gameplay is done in Japanese-style, puzzle-less adventure format. The entire game is set on the Titanic. The player is generally free to visit various areas of the ship in any order, though access to certain locations is restricted and necessary events must be triggered in order to gain it.

Their first task to get on with the case is to get a vehicle, which they are lent by the headmaster. Before they can leave school grounds, though, they must pass a test to get a driving permit. This is where the other main part of the game commences.\n\nCybernetic Hi-School is not only an adventure game, but also a strip-quiz game, which is slightly novel compared to the more common strip poker and strip mahjongg games. If the player gives the right answers to the driving knowledge test conducted by the female police officer, she will strip for them (for reasons unknown). When she is naked, the player will get their permit, and can leave the premises to find the leader of the school's touring club, who they must also beat in a quiz to see her naked and acquire the driving techniques they will need to beat the Highway Buster. All questions in the game are driving related, although they later on stray from the more mundane legal paragraphs to about car and bike related pop culture trivia.","Publisher":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"179044":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Cybernetic Hi-School Part 4: Ape Hunter J"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"4d1ca83b-fc87-49f0-9afc-dfa4103cf8d8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"05945763-fd28-4048-9841-76c90ccd5776.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a1dda5db-f82d-4a5e-8a60-d7bebc4e8535.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"55ecd5d5-3754-4878-bde8-88c0827e7f09.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dennou Gakuen IV: Ape Hunter J","Overview":"In 2006 the people had just one anxiety - \"Monkey\".

Beast. In the future, the Earth is split in two halves. Humans control the Southern hemisphere, while the Northern one is inhabited by various half-human, half-beast tribes. The humans want to conquer the lands of the half-beasts and to possess their sacred statues called jinn. The game begins when the three main heroes, the half-beasts Wan Dabadatta (\"Derbard\" in English anime translation), Bud Mint, and the mermaid Mei Mer have already met each other. They found themselves in the Saihate tower, when the two human warriors V-Darn and V-Sion, accompanied by the imp Akumako, attack the tower and try to capture the heroes, who must now escape and eventually stop the humans' evil plans for world domination.\n\nKO Seiki Beast Sanjūshi: Gaia no Fukkatsu can be described as a \"light\" Japanese RPG. There are no weapons or armor the heroes can equip, very few \"friendly\" areas, and almost no NPC interaction; the game mostly consists of long crawls through maze-like top-down locations. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based combat on an isometric battle screen. The heroes (up to four in a party) can use magical attacks, and later also gain access to magic spells and \"beast transformation\" abilities. Instead of shops that sell items, there are machines for the same purposes found inside the dungeon-like areas.","Publisher":"Matrix","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"179046":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Kotetsu no Daibōken"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"T2 Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a1ba20a4-5d17-4d18-ad55-75e882e6ca3c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a5d6a66-2de0-4150-839e-d8321f366346.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b6ea3d97-ea08-4022-9709-ea65fb193df6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kotetsu no Daibouken","Overview":"Kotetsu no Daibōken is based on the anime The Adventures of Kotetsu.

The game can be perceived as a sequel to the anime, since it begins roughly where the original story ended, with the former \"nerdy\" spy Tatsuya Mikado already turned good and living by Miho Kuon along with Kotetsu and other heroes. Like the original anime, the game mixes modern setting with bizarre and supernatural elements. Unlike the anime, this game contains many explicit sexual scenes.\n\nThe player-controlled character is for the most part Tatsuya Mikado. The gameplay consists of selecting menu-based commands. The interaction is minimal, and exploration (through menu commands as well) is possible only at a few points in the game. Most of the times, the player is presented with a menu screen containing two or more choices. Making a choice slightly alters the course of the story (mostly regarding the sex scenes). There are also a few turn-based battles in the game, which work a bit like rock-paper-scissors game: it is possible to attack, to raise the attack power of the next turn, or to defend.

Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.\n\nOtherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.\n\nDespite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga\/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.","Publisher":"Active Software","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"180943":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tenshindo","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"43628150-314d-4db2-bddb-6b521afcdd95.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7a5380a-4377-4355-b63c-ce7263764e36.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"529d4682-7357-4aeb-80b5-84ab08429cf3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Jinn: Eternal Hero","Overview":"The hero of this game is much more interested in pretty girls than in ancient prophecies and religious rituals.

Galactor","Overview":"The game is based on the anime Science Ninja Team Gatchaman (also known under differently translated titles Battle of the Planets and G-Force). Set in the future, it describes the adventures of a team of five young superheroes under the command of Dr. Nambu, the head of the International Science Organization, whose goal is to fight evil aliens known as the Galactor. Led by the mysterious Berg Kattse and aided by a robotic construct known as the Turtle King, the Galactor are trying to steal uranium in order to create more machines and conquer the world. The Ninja Team is lead by Ken Washio and includes three other boys and one girl.\n\nThe game is mainly a Japanese-style adventure with simple turn-based battles with isometric perspective thrown in. There is no RPG system or character growth of any kind. All the battles are pre-set and dictated by the plot. There is no movement on the battle screen. Typically, the party of five heroes must fight several waves of enemies. The heroes have different parameters, but use the same techniques. Special attacks require Special Points (SP), which are gradually restored as the battle progresses. In the beginning of any battle, the player has to choose one of the characters and can only control him\/her; it is possible to switch to another character only if the first one dies. There are also battles in vehicles, unique for each character; however, they follow the exact same pattern.

The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1991-05-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182406":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Japan Home Video","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"52def50b-91f0-419a-9ff8-155d252880c5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8662976-d77d-441b-95ec-0a815d3ac3e7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d91073ef-fc4e-40c6-acda-cc503e757f25.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"633d7e93-315f-4c42-95ee-431315c8cb60.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aggregate","Overview":"Aggregate is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Japan Home Video, which was released in Japan in 1994","Publisher":"Japan Home Video","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182407":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lawins","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e5037304-981e-4919-90c3-71f2c8beacb3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5efea7b0-320e-4d8c-8cbe-26358ef4b5fb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8eb29d21-6811-40d0-945f-70e206aa5955.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c252aff4-7f90-436c-abdb-74625bcfa232.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b848a41c-92ac-43ec-966e-89ea12dde00c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aiza: New Generation","Overview":"Somewhere on the continent of Fandell, there is a kingdom known as Wineslem.

Inevitably events unfold that leave you as the only one who can prevent a mysterious invader from taking control of the galaxy.\n\nStarcraft Inc. is mainly known for porting numerous popular western games from DOS to Japanese home computer systems like PC-98 and FM Towns. Starfire is one of their few original games, but uses an engine taken from the Might & Magic series of games they translated and ported to PC-98 in the early 90's. It retains the 3D first person dungeon crawler navigation and sprite based graphics, but the classic RPG encounters are replaced with a simple real time action-based combat where you shoot the enemies as they appear on screen. Instead of levels and experience points you increase your combat stats through upgrades from engineers and doctors. Killing enemies provide you with credits to spend at item shops and arms dealers.\n\nEventually you gain access to a space ship, which enables you to travel the galaxy. That also means running into hostile space ships that you will have to fend off in simple space battles. To unravel the plot you have to visit the various systems and their space stations and talk with the characters that live on them, eliminating space pirates and alien forces along the way.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182477":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Softech","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"a7604091-0987-45c8-a19e-2a4566e469f7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"44e77497-e254-4e3e-ab1d-0c2dce72c499.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d53c3f93-ac22-4e54-ba4e-2ceb480592d9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73c9d9b3-e873-4ae3-8680-d38531f828d8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ce4aaa7c-e9cf-4c90-9b55-f90640c5a0d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1bfc2a97-2d27-4f02-9ca6-685695b895dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"50b622fe-f39a-4bc0-8f5c-c8821b3813c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Executioners","Overview":"Executioners is a Strategy game, developed and published by Nippon Softech, which was released in Japan in 1993.","Publisher":"Nippon Softech","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182478":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Future Wars: Toki no Boukensha"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Delphine Software International","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"fc2af29e-e0e7-4122-8454-74aefc8db752.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"936cb010-12e0-4439-b048-280d703de48b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8f5fca7f-a7d7-4f50-9179-e4221c581165.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab0b4dfe-6c1d-45ad-9b24-637afec38f27.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Future Wars","Overview":"In the year 1989, a simple window cleaner is working outside of a skyscraper.

All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.\n\nSome quirks add tactical depth: The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.\n\n7 Colors can be played against the computer or a human opponent, even over a local network - a rare feature at the time.

The game is set in a fictional medieval fantasy world and its story takes place on the continent of Aglia. Many primary and secondary characters are featured and eventually become controllable by the player, but the initial segment of the story begins in the small southern kingdom of Finice-Deal, focusing on a young knight who has completed his nobility initiation and must protect his country from hostile pagan worshipers.\n\nThe game is divided into scenarios, each built like a large-scale tactical battle that takes place in a location comprising outdoor areas and towns. The player navigates characters in real time on the overhead battle field in a point-and-click fashion, with enemies moving in real time as well. Each character represents a unit of a different type (such as knights, archers, magicians, etc., some with a general leading them). When a player-controlled and an AI-controlled unit are near each other the player can opt to view a full-screen animated battle sequence, the outcome of which is decided depending on the combatant's parameters. Like in regular RPGs, towns can be visited and establishments such as inns, shops and bars can be accessed (however, without free movement through the rest of the town). This can be done in the middle of the battle, provided a character is positioned near a town gate. Characters gain experience points, level up, and can equip a variety of weapons, armor and accessories.","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/eRBudxBAxr8"},"182547":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Wolfpack"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NovaLogic, Inc.","Genres":"Action; Vehicle Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"c98ab70a-cee2-424a-a7fa-16f62052e460.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6913d82c-1d04-4e46-8406-87dfc0bc3fbf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7692caf4-ca78-4a70-9a99-8e406ce83adf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9de67d03-075a-49da-836a-eee123579022.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"77c595ed-9774-486b-8090-b2a96e98a8d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wolf Pack","Overview":"In this WW2 combat simulation one or two players can take command of one of three different sets of naval vessels.

Hong Kong was most affected by the mysterious demonic attack. Terrible diseases turned the once prosperous city into a pale shadow of itself. But once people came back to see what happened to the isolated city, they saw it was ruled by a new order - a corporation called SIVA. The new order proclaimed New Hong Kong to be an independent state. People's Republic of China and United Kingdom signed an agreement in which they both renounced their claims over the city.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Tianren, a \"diver\" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong, he was brought up in the house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the supernatural beings from Chinese myths.\n\nIllusion City is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike most games of the genre, it has no overworld, and takes place entirely in a vast city divided into several districts. The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.\n\nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.\n\nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182667":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullet Proof Software","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"dae050c1-e143-4e1e-ade1-b582b12e339f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b6e61d4-e565-46f2-918b-f575e881f632.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"59fe99d2-7d02-48d5-aa8e-b50f375ae20c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Frontier Universe","Overview":"Frontier Universe is a Strategy game, developed and published by Bullet Proof Software, which was released in Japan in 1993","Publisher":"Bullet Proof Software","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182668":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Frontier","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b4e66ec8-56dc-4bb8-99ec-442bad188842.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1df4ff29-0391-4f27-8c08-6ca2836527ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5cfb1bb0-4d03-4bb8-881f-51cfc3afe9c8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Frontier","Overview":"A collection of three stories:\n1. 遠雷ワイバーン is about a bounty hunter who stays at the inn and is requested to rescue a kidnapped girl.\n2. 快感空間「愛」is about a couple who get summoned to another world one day.

You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.\n\nYour aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.","Publisher":"SystemSoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"183055":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Studio Twinkle","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e17e138a-28a7-49de-91b5-a7af668e1ea9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f65197ab-77db-40e8-b274-3dc1599b2c60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e479db17-5f5b-4352-8203-761a170b57c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2cba9099-1c95-473f-9877-ddadddd47c03.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Twilight","Overview":"In Twilight, the protagonist, who works for a mysterious magic-using organization, is set to Transylvania, to investigate the murder of a nun known as Sister Christa.

The original story was about a little girl named Ruri who received a magic wand from two dice-shaped familiars, and as a result turned into Chiyomi, a sexy gambling queen who abused her new powers to win money. In Viper BTR, the familiars return and give Ruri another chance to use her powers for good. However, she encounters Mai, another girl who underwent a similar transformation, thanks to her own familiar Domino. But unlike Ruri\/Chiyomi, Mai uses her power for good. Will the heroine be able to join her or will envy and greed control her once again?\n\nViper BTR differs from other Viper games by incorporating a new genre into the usual \"choose-your-own-adventure\" gameplay, namely mahjong. There is an obligatory mahjong match in the game that the heroine has to win, and also a special \"mahjong mode\", accessed from the main menu. The rest of the game consists of pictures with text as well as animated sequences; however, unlike in other Viper games, there is rudimentary navigation in \"Viper BTR\" (at certain points it is possible to choose a location to go to from a menu list).

One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...\n\nThe game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","Publisher":"Basho House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"183175":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Navitune"},{"AlternateName":"Dragon Koukaiki"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kougado","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"09c827dc-73dd-4843-8e6e-029f81bc84a4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"179a6800-50ca-48c9-be1f-883365b42c33.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"49de81e5-c674-4d3a-8862-018682b8b213.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"14b7773d-c510-4ee8-b87a-735f12c9f998.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0d9da4a9-08a1-403e-95ec-b103b1d523fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Navitune: Dragon Voyage","Publisher":"Kougado","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"183176":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ASCII","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0e5273eb-d51c-497a-ad64-7a07b15557f2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e50fa74-945b-4a79-ae69-83c829a047c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f052c62a-6eeb-4aaf-b72b-4ecb65c33793.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Planets of Dragon","Overview":"Rare Japanese fairy tale style adventure game with excellent graphics and really worth a play.","Publisher":"ASCII","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/LhH-jfHUlqs"},"183177":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision, Inc.","Genres":"Puzzle; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"8ba92d08-9922-43c6-a0c8-7c7ceb4bfc78.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7be5def6-03b0-48c2-9374-b405bbf7261b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61915905-e348-4472-9297-338e2e1c1ac8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8ba16ebc-55d0-4796-b262-ad0463b3234b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Super Shanghai: Dragon's Eye","Overview":"Dragon's Eye is an installment in the tile-matching game series initiated by Activision.

A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.\n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical\/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Ancient_Art_of_War"},"183253":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft Plan","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d0f8d1cc-6fc9-4168-b096-fe7cced2d700.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"148ade11-664c-497a-8b92-6ae29cfd3878.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b1323b23-96dc-40a9-a778-c4cce5e0efdc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01310b52-c0cf-402e-b4de-f30b15c2aa66.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"92021bd6-4208-4b9d-81f6-c374dbddf7b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"79f19fad-2149-4c2b-b5a0-23e38580fefe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Another Genesis","Overview":"The young Jin has grown up in a quiet secluded hut in a peaceful family, thinking it was his own.

You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map.\n\nOne part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship.\n\nAnother part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province.\n\nWhen you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight.\n\nWhen your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat.\n\nFinally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183275":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Champions of Krynn"},{"AlternateName":"AD&D: Champions of Krynn"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"89cdf43f-7860-46d9-b199-a189aee27e54.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"34edbf2a-c180-4679-a10c-7ddd44f06885.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5ff832c-2a84-4b7b-b30e-4a52c35b1330.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"85ecf759-9217-4519-8385-75afa038ecf5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b7496413-f036-4aa1-89d3-3886131deb22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Champions of Krynn","Overview":"The War of the Lance is over, the dragon armies have been defeated.

Hayashi Ryuusuke is walking through the crowded city, feeling sad that he is alone on such a day. Suddenly, he spots a neon sign: Custom Mate. He enters and sees a strange receptionist with elf-like ears and a magic symbol on the forehead. She creates the girl of his dreams and they get married! But this is just the beginning, and Ryuusuke realizes that marriage is not all about the honeymoon...\n\nThe third Custom Mate game differs from its predecessors by offering much deeper simulation gameplay, which includes different aspects of the life of a married couple beside just sex. In the beginning, the player creates the protagonist, choosing his age, blood type, and personality. The future wife is created the same way. Unlike the previous games, it is impossible to change appearance and physical aspects of the girl; however, there are many more personality traits.\n\nAfter the honeymoon, the couple returns to daily routine. The player can make daily or monthly schedule. The wife's behavior is determined by character creation, but also by the choices the player makes. The wife would often ask questions, make suggestions, etc.; the player's reaction determines future interactions and the overall development of the relationship. The couple has various parameters, from love level to monetary wealth. Sex interaction plays an important role; the player should choose the right actions, depending on the wife's personality, otherwise the relationship will deteriorate. Menu-based interface is utilized for most of the game, but the actual sex interaction is done in point-and-click fashion, with action icons.","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183283":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"20b35c69-72c3-437c-9eca-e84b78581c42.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ded77dea-25e1-4627-8d8c-a19b1da7aea4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1669a207-91ab-4d46-90c6-b0bb5658d3ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Custom Mate","Overview":"A young man finds a mysterious box. Making sure no one is at home, he opens the box and finds a scroll with a magic incantation inside. He chants the magic spell - and immediately a cute female elf appears. She says she can create any girl the hero wants. But once the girl is created, he has to figure out how to win her good graces...\n\nCustom Mate can be called a \"seduction simulator\". Lacking the adventure elements of Cocktail's most famous series, Can Can Bunny, Custom Mate offers much deeper simulation gameplay instead. In the beginning of the game, the player effectively \"creates\" the girl he will need to seduce; it is possible to choose age, height, breast size, hair style, and personality. Mixing all these parameters results in different girls who require different approach. For example, an older, experienced and direct woman might appreciate physical stimulation (kissing etc.), while a young shy girl needs to talk more before the hero can afford any straight-forward actions.\n\nThe gameplay is menu-driven - the player can choose to talk, to ask, to look, to touch, to kiss, and to take off the girl's clothes. Choosing one of these actions usually leads to a sub-menu, which varies depending on the girl and the current situation. For example, the \"talk\" menu usually brings a large sub-menu of more precise actions (\"praise\", \"order\", \"beg\", etc.), each of which opens new sub-menus. Similarly, physical interaction can also become quite detailed: the \"kiss\" command opens a sub-menu (\"lick\", \"bite\", etc.). Physical interaction is made more precise by implementing a point-and-click interface; in many cases, choosing the exact body part to interact with can be a matter of \"life and death\", since it is possible to make a girl very angry, which might lead to a Game Over.","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183284":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Genres":"Adventure; Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"18b7a601-7268-4f23-bd3e-3e9fd1c7fed5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0d425105-ac71-4d6e-b469-ca2884c24906.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cc5763c9-0e2c-49c5-8fd8-27bd6a47cdcd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Custom Mate 2","Overview":"The second game in the Custom Mate series once again allows the hero to create the girl of his dreams; this time not magically, but by engaging the services of Custom Corporation, whose operator is nevertheless still the same cute elf who created the girls in the previous game.\n\nThe \"girl creation\" part offers more possibilities than before, such as exact bra size or the clothes the girl will wear (school girl, nurse, etc.). This allows more combinations and therefore more different girls. The \"seduction simulator\" part is simplified compared to the first game.

They can be accessed from the initial game \"hub\", which is viewed from a top-down perspective and allows the player to control the sexy demon Akuma, the series' mascot, as she runs around a small town, visiting houses that lead to the game's features: playing the scenarios, viewing the pictures, getting acquainted with the developers, etc.\n\nThe first scenario tells the story of a Japanese businessman and treasure hunter named Hiroshi, who has organized a perilous expedition into South American jungle, hoping to find the legendary spring of eternal youth. However, on the way to their discovery, the group has to confront monsters and other dangerous specimens of the jungle...\n\nThe second scenario is set in a pseudo Middle-Eastern environment, and focuses on a man named Farouk, who was cursed by an evil magician. In order to remove the curse, Farouk travels through a vast desert to a nearby town, hoping to find people who would help him in his predicament.\n\nThe third scenario directly continues one of the scenarios of DOR 2. It is sub-titled Armored Fighter Gyleban, and is the second part of the story. The protagonist is the leader of a squad of female fighters, who confront an organization under the leadership of the evil Grauber. Grauber's warrior, a young girl named Meiya, switches sides and decides to help the heroes in their battle.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly similar to other DOR games - picking choices from a menu until the next scene is triggered. However, during certain scenes the interface switches to point-and-click, with selectable icons (\"tongue\" and \"hand\"), which pretty much explains the direction those \"certain scenes\" lead into.","Publisher":"D.O.

The biggest event of the school is an all-female wrestling competition. Kensuke finds himself in a promising situation: in order to secure his support, the young and pretty competitors are willing to go far - very, very far...\n\nThe gameplay in DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is the same as in the previous entries.

But as more adventurers join, the city is overrun by monsters, and Guy realizes it's not about finding job any more - it's about protecting the entire country.\n\nEven though it was made by a Japanese company, Early Kingdom is more similar to Western RPGs, being more exploration-oriented rather than focusing on characters and their personal stories. Graphically, it discards the traditional Japanese manga\/anime aesthetics in favor of realistic character portraits. The entire game is played from top-down perspective. Combat is real-time, utilizing the characteristic Kure Software engine with large parties of both playable characters and enemies, allowing massive battle scenes. The player can control only one character at a time, while the others fight on their own. Attacks are executed simply by bumping into enemies. The characters get experience points and level up from defeating monsters.

The game is set on a nameless island, which has elements of medieval fantasy as well as futuristic civilization. It allows the player to control a party of three female students from the School of Adventuring. The player can name the girls, but not change their unique battle techniques and proficiencies. The goal of the game is to reach a higher rank than the three competing teams (also containing girls only). Each team is accompanied by a guardian elf, and might also meet and\/or hire other NPCs.\n\nThe game has an internal schedule, which reminds the player of the other competitors and what they might have accomplished in the meantime. Game progression is non-linear: the four cities on the island can be accessed right from the beginning. Each city contains special locations where the party can choose to accept a mission. These missions can also be completed in any order; each has an approximate difficulty label. Accepting a mission usually unlocks new hostile areas, which are inaccessible otherwise.\n\nDuring a mission, the game plays the same way as most other Japanese RPGs: exploring the dungeon, the party finds treasure and fights enemies in turn-based combat (viewed from first-person perspective). There are no random battles: all the enemies are visibly walking on screen and can be avoided. Combat largely relies on techniques, which are grouped by classes and are unique to each girl.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183318":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Silky's","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"96734fcd-5c95-4f95-8df6-94ea7440d4f7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cf1d0d61-e9e3-4406-b2d8-1e269ca4707f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0533e1bf-b2f6-490c-b49e-3c918cc1a9f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Premium","Overview":"Premium consists of four scenarios, each one of which is dedicated entirely to sex (sometimes with a bit of conversation and very straight-forward seduction before).

This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar"},"183330":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ultima Underworld"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blue Sky Productions","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"3656593b-129a-4eff-8806-a6444af92f06.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7073e451-28ad-480c-aa66-f254bfbd3822.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ed3a1aaf-dd55-4cd5-9cdb-1d5762321197.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"df849b75-bb62-4648-81cd-05e71eed42b3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bd5b3c03-1c45-4cae-8f02-293b5196ebe3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"03b16fa8-41a6-409a-b316-e1b9cdc52604.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss","Overview":"After having brought peace to Britannia during his previous journey there, the Avatar returns to our world. However, he is haunted by ghostly dreams that warn him of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar decides to travel there once again. Upon his arrival, he witnesses the kidnapping of Baron Almric's daughter. Found guilty of the crime, the Avatar is thrown into the Great Stygian Abyss with the choice of either finding the girl or rotting in the dungeon. On his journey he will have to get along with the many inhabitants of the dungeon, who are survivors of a failed colony, and eventually find out that there's much more to this kidnapping than meets the eye.\n\nUltima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is commonly considered the first role-playing game with fluid first-person movement in a real 3D environment. Unlike earlier first-person RPGs such as Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The player is also able to look up and down with the press of a key, jump, and swim. The dungeon is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion, but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges, underground rivers, and more.\n\nThe game's combat system is action-oriented. The player has to draw his weapon, aim at his opponent, and hold the cursor over the game screen to inflict damage; the longer the player holds it, the stronger is the attack. Some weapons have different types of attacks, depending on where the cursor is held: for example, jabs are executed when the cursor is near the bottom of the screen, while slashes are performed with the cursor in the middle.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultima_Underworld:_The_Stygian_Abyss"},"183331":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ultima Underworld II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Looking Glass Technologies, Inc.","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"2ef6bae3-799b-4ca8-bd3a-83712e0f5c3e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8a8ae16a-485a-40b8-8139-be65994d5df1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a9bc92cf-cef7-4e9b-be2a-7941f1febcf4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"480855d8-a005-4990-a695-a10763f9c966.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8eccc4d1-94a9-41bb-acbd-efc0ecd3275e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d79f195b-96aa-424b-b0f9-c5c8554ba971.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds","Overview":"Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds takes place one year after the events of Ultima VII: The Black Gate. To celebrate the defeat of the Guardian, Lord British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle.

Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must travel to these worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.\n\nThis sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its 3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender, class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit points and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an interactive world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved.\n\nThe game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of its predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, an alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and sound have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been increased, there are new monster graphics and the game now features digitized sound effects.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultima_Underworld_II:_Labyrinth_of_Worlds"},"183332":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ultima V"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"a3918b1d-5b43-4f94-b2f4-c2157bc31738.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4787226a-9a38-4faa-ac1c-40ed6aae568b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08592673-8a51-406e-9464-d4611e55d978.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"933d92d8-9c46-4682-b1f1-52e9f8b99973.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4e340396-3f08-4de6-b0d6-cbdadcb72dea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny","Overview":"The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.\n\nUltima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on.

In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.\n\nUltima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no \"world map\" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved.\n\nThe interface has been re-designed, the original key-bound commands co-existing with selectable command icons and mouse-based interaction. The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters.

She sent her troops to the south, invading the kingdom of elves. The army of Ornic started conquering one country after the other. The king and queen of Cardic, a powerful country in the south, decided to stop the madness, sending their soldiers, under the commands of general Richmond, to find allies wherever possible and to defeat the army of Ornic.\n\nFirst Queen is a mixture of RPG and strategy game with real-time combat. In a RPG fashion, the party of heroes roams the world, fighting enemies, buying items, and leveling up. However, the focus of the game is shifted towards recruiting soldiers and fighting against whole armies.

Instead of menu-based location choice of the previous games, the main character can actually walk on a world map with icons representing locations.","Publisher":"Kure Software Koubou","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"183343":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"First Queen IV: Barcia Senki"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kure Software Koubou","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"dc69ef37-4708-4ef3-bd15-2b84e5596b9e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"46c434ce-7ed7-4078-a450-da1d007b1ae9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3001fe65-e724-4ed5-b00f-1dbdbc002cb7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bbecb839-308e-4c96-a2d9-fd498e8c5748.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"dabac66f-1712-440b-a341-c0a05d34f1c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e4b2cf79-9c27-45d0-a43a-8330cd23bc14.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"First Queen IV","Overview":"The land of Logris was originally inhabited by elves, dwarves, and other magical creatures. When the humans arrived, the cultural differences between the races were not enough to provoke a war, so for a while they co-existed peacefully. Afterwards, the humans have split into several smaller nations. The nation of Barcia in the north had a small population, and its king Zenel was worried his country will be conquered by others. To prevent that, he invited the dark magician Zon, who cast a spell over his soldiers. But nothing comes without a price. Insanity seized the king and its army. Barcia began invading other countries. A warrior named Ares and his friends try to assassinate the king, but as a result, Ares is thrown in prison. A mysterious man with magical powers saves Ares, telling him that it's time to sort out the differences between nations and races, and lead an army to stop the madness of Barcia...\n\nThe fourth entry in First Queen series utilizes the trademark \"mixed-up characters\" battle system, with dozens of characters on both sides fighting each other in real time. The game features a new point-and-click interface, with battle tactics accessible at any moment from the battle screen. It is also possible to focus attacks on an enemy simply by clicking on him with the mouse. Compared to the previous entries, First Queen IV emphasizes the war game aspect, with less focus on RPG-like exploration and more strategic challenge. The movement on the map has grown into an important gameplay device: different armies move simultaneously, and the player has to pay attention for enemy forces advancing to different locations. It is possible to split units, create new ones, exchange soldiers, and send different units to different locations. An enemy army may join forces with the heroes upon defeat; diplomacy can also be used to make agreements with sovereign city-states. Once a location is clear of enemies, it is possible to \"camp\" and to direct other actions from there.","Publisher":"Kure Software Koubou","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"183344":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e6ff5f38-e5d3-4319-8309-c55830ad0e85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"296ff726-1216-482b-87c5-7208f3140216.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08ca3d3b-55aa-4578-ad46-ebd072a1df55.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cdc36edf-d726-462b-b6f1-bcf4b6831818.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1ff4cba3-1e89-4cff-ad11-b9266bd2589c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Foxy","Overview":"The story of Foxy is rather basic: a hostile army from a country known simply as \"Red\" attacks the capital city of the \"Blue\" nation.

Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.\n\nThe game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around \"historical\" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.\n\nThe combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually takes control of a \"home planet\", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map.

The first episode introduces a girl from the tennis club, the protagonist being either an older boy or a younger classmate. The second revolves around a female high school student who stays in the school after classes; the protagonist can be a male classmate or a male teacher. Finally, the third episode is dedicated to the lovely school nurse, with the protagonist taking two alternate routes to win her graces.\n\nThe gameplay usually involves selecting verbs from command menus with different options and sometimes vast sub-menus of objects. The sex scenes (and some others) are handled through a point-and-click interface, with the player selecting an appropriate command (\"Look\", \"Touch\", \"Kiss\", etc.), and clicking on an object on the screen to interact with. Many choices the player is able to make in the game are \"wrong\", leading to Game Over.","Publisher":"Software House Parsley","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183358":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Software House Parsley","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0f65d79b-3d1b-4d4d-8f1b-4f08621deac8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7d881dd6-62d6-44e8-a025-5b80eccc448e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4639dade-c470-4b7a-acc1-90af46538845.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Image II","Overview":"Like its predecessor, Image II consists of three episodes, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be accessed from the main menu; each episode can be played in two different ways (\"scenarios\"). All the three episodes are set in medieval\/fantasy environment.\nThe first episode tells of a \"cursed\" treasure room somewhere on the outskirts of a town; the only one brave enough to venture there is a young hero named Recardo. In scenario A, Recardo has to find a way to defeat a demon, using objects from the treasure room; in scenario B, he has to face a female demonic creature and seduce her without getting killed in the process. Scenario A has a large turn-based battle that can be lost; the key to winning is usage of items.\n\nThe second episode stars the fighter Rush and his female companion Femir; traveling across the desert, they enter a town, and Rush decides to participate in a fighter competition. This episode differs from the other ones (and most other Japanese-style adventures) by having free movement in top-down environment. Scenario A puts the player into Rush's role; the gameplay here contains slight, mini-game-like elements of role-playing, as Rush has to win turn-based battles, gain money, and buy better weapons, equipment, and items to survive. In Scenario B, the player controls Femir. While Rush is fighting his battles, Femir investigates a strange disappearance of female warriors.\n\nThe third episode is the most traditional one, both from the point of view of story and gameplay. This rather minimalistic episode depicts a meeting between the young boy Fand and the girl Remia, who is from another town. Fand shows her around, the two have a date, and the rest of the episode evolves according to the player's decisions for both characters (Fand in Scenario A, Remia in Scenario B).\nThe gameplay is similar to the one implemented in the first game, with the exception of the episode-specific enhancements described above. Most of the time the player has several verbs at his disposal, sometimes with object sub-menus. Sex scenes are usually handled via a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verb commands.","Publisher":"Software House Parsley","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183359":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Swat","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"60c3a6e4-8e5b-46bf-ac06-09a375f13662.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9e9c136-0d5c-4500-92d5-cce8cba3b68a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ad7d72c4-a295-431f-b651-7c4f386f1c74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Image Room: Banana Club","Overview":"Protagonist wanders the Christmas night town without money and in desperation till a flier of Banana Club flies in his face.

Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called \"The Great Disaster\". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...\n\nJoker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles.

The same nightmare pursues him: he sees his sweetheart Laura calling for him, begging him to save her... Wild has to rebuild his life from scratch, but this nightmare ties him to his past... so he ventures out to look for answers once again.\n\nGameplay-wise, Joker II is pretty much identical to its predecessor.

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Bounty"},"183364":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"994f3d04-8154-4b11-bbd6-7c43056bf70c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fec3e8bd-334b-4585-9df7-4b7763b7aca4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"064e6151-ebac-4db9-b19e-4180f3dc9ffe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Dungeon","Overview":"King's Dungeon is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Soft Plan, which was released in Japan in 1992","Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"183365":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"King's Quest V"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3ba700d8-8f9c-4aa7-a93b-a55b1aec960f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"25ad0447-d36c-4db4-8641-842677dac6f8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"59b4e8a2-a7b4-46e6-aaff-100cc912f2ad.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b86908d5-7273-4c5c-99c6-8ec95c176625.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6e32a411-43f9-4944-8da5-f5b4468d5a19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!","Overview":"On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line Japan, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Quest_V"},"183366":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Forest","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"3985f5a8-308c-47b1-af5b-df21b2076f70.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"adfa460e-3992-49bd-a5c6-253c8f7a2463.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd066729-ad0c-4ea4-ba1e-432f50ec5630.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07a82421-85c4-42c5-8077-95fa2627e44c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d70605dc-b594-4e16-8027-1d6ddee03c6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ef4f7242-78a5-45bb-a4b6-a17f20b6b1ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a5cd91c5-0cf1-4350-b1dd-c883861acfda.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kuro no Ken","Overview":"Long time ago, the Black Dragon was destroying human cities and devouring human beings.

It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills.

The story of the game eventually reveals a connection to these mysterious books, but it begins in a more prosaic way. Set in the American Wild West (with fictional locations), it follows the story of Wilfred R. Anderson, or simply Fred. His father left him a gift, a seemingly ordinary gun. But one day, Fred's sweetheart Christina is kidnapped; the ransom note proposes a meeting in a saloon in another town, and demands that gun in exchange for Christina's freedom. Fred and his friend Max and Edward head to the other town - and that is just the beginning of a very long journey, that will force the young men to face grave dangers and unspeakable supernatural forces.\n\nThe stand-out feature of Libros de Chilam Balam is its unusual Wild West setting. In other aspects, the game plays like a typical Japanese RPG, particularly similar to Phantasy Star series (the battles with abstract backgrounds and over-the-head view of the characters remind of Phantasy Star II). Characters can equip guns, but the way weapons are handled is no different from a standard Japanese RPG. The heroes roam the top-down world and fight random monsters in turn-based combat; there are even magic spells of various kinds - healing, supporting, and offensive.

The three girls turn into the super-heroines Phoenix Rose, Tiger Lily, and Tortoise Cheery - the Power Dolls - and venture into Barado's dungeons to defeat him once and for all...\n\n...only the player won't be helping them. In a sudden twist, the player is given control of the evil Kyuuma. The girls are automatically walking through the isometric, maze-like dungeons, trying to find the exit. The player's goal is to help Kyuuma summon monsters to stop them. As the girls walk, their attack level increases (from 0 to 4), and so does Kyuuma's summoning level. At level 4, she can summon the most powerful monsters in each category (giants, demons, spirits, etc.). When the monster is placed into the dungeon, it will try to find its way to the girls. Depending on the girls' level and the monster's level, the battle will decrease the girls' level by a certain number. The trick is to position different monsters in such a way that the girls will have to face a monster when they are all at level 0. Losing a battle at level 0 will cause a girl to become disoriented and wander off, turning into easier prey for the monsters, and eventually getting killed in a battle.\n\nThe game doesn't stop if the girls successfully traverse a dungeon.

In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.\n\nExploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also \"multi-class\" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pool_of_Radiance"},"183403":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Official Dungeons & Dragons Computer Product: Pools of Darkness"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"69429170-a80a-4936-8d0c-04e26e1e938e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1691826d-4a56-401e-9fa2-ec0fe8c08b5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"954afe22-2fdd-4496-b855-813bc8a64748.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pools of Darkness","Overview":"Ten years have passed since the events described in Pool of Radiance, and the heroes return to the city where it all started, Phlan.

The goal is clear: explore the land and rid it of the evil, by taking on Bane's minions one by one...\n\nPools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good\/Evil and Lawful\/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.\n\nThe turn-based combat is done in similar style as other Gold Box games: the player navigates characters one by one on the top-down battle field, assigning various commands. Experience points are gained after successfully defeating enemies. Enemies appear randomly on the world map as well as in dungeons.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pools_of_Darkness"},"183404":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Popful Mail: Magical Fantasy Adventure"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"e2d3321a-02fe-4419-9368-111283ea5276.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3cf08eb7-36b4-4553-bc5b-6f2244094a79.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"35238382-4e90-485f-962f-810baddaf0a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"328f39df-143a-4207-a0d2-ac5d867d40ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Popful Mail","Overview":"Mail is a young, cute, enthusiastic female bounty-hunting elf.

However, shortly thereafter the boy started seeing strange dreams. Upon his arrival he discovered a jar in a hole underneath the floor in his room, and that jar miraculously produced a young woman named Ruri (which means \"lapis lazuli\"), who becomes a part of his life in a way he would never expect.\n\nRuriiro no Yuki plays mostly like a visual novel with light simulation elements. Though certain events will occur regardless of the player's actions, much of the plot is determined by decisions taken by the player, which may include locations to visit or actions to choose when prompted. The game has an internal clock, with each visit to a location occupying a fixed segment of time. The player can also choose to advance the clock in most cases. The game follows the protagonist's daily life, usually beginning with school and evolving into whatever the player may choose - staying at home all day, doing homework, going outside, and so on. Depending on these choices the protagonist will have different relationships with the game's female characters.\n\nThe game contains scenes with explicit nudity, but they can normally only be achieved by following specific paths through the story and pursuing a relationship in a focused way.","Publisher":"AIL","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183420":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"73a9bb82-3965-4d85-b95c-93e290bc0efa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"72d76952-189f-4b79-89ab-657b0220187a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"674785c9-463d-43cd-abe1-cd0d41a3ad19.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"80f72dec-cb5b-449d-ba46-cddefd92eb88.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c46fc6f7-f9a3-44f1-939a-c4f98baec58f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1d45ead0-7303-4c0b-8d78-35fe78c4e443.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Salad no Kuni no Tomato-hime","Overview":"The evil Minister Pumpkin betrayed his king, kidnapped his daughter, the lovely Princess Tomato, and began to terrorize the land of vegetables.

When the protagonist is able to capture a victim, he proceeds to torture her; the player is then presented with a point-and-click interface. From time to time, turn-based battles will ensue; however, they are built more like dialogue choices rather than real RPG or strategic fights: the player has to find the right combination of various attacks and the adversary's body parts in order to inflict damage.

The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order.

One day, he receives just the case he was hoping for: he has to travel to a remote space colony near the Sun - more precisely, to the women school in this colony. The principal of the school has committed suicide. Two agents that were sent to the colony disappeared under mysterious circumstances. It's time for Max to find out what's going on - an interesting side-quest to his main mission: have sex with as many girls as possible!\n\nShiritsu Tantei Max: Sennyuu!! Nazo no Joshikou is primarily an adventure game. Although there are randomly appearing enemies and combat in the game, there are no character statistics of any kind, and no strategy needed for combat: Max simply has to periodically reload his gun to stay alive. The movement is done entirely on the location map, with Max represented as a small dot. The player moves this dot around by using arrow keys; whenever Max reaches a location with a character, the player can choose to initiate conversation. Talking to different characters and gaining access to new locations is the main bulk of the gameplay.\n\nThe game has sexual scenes.","Publisher":"Agumix","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"183433":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Agumix","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d16fa2dc-87a3-41f1-9eb1-d7047e56ff8d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"27a304ac-3de3-4fba-ba66-be220ae36153.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fe005a15-01cc-4e23-9e24-25c34a9c94e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shiritsu Tantei Max 2: Master of Elemental","Overview":"The great womanizing detective Max, whom we met in the first Shiritsu Tantei Max game is back! This time, he is taken to a magical parallel dimension, which is populated by elemental spirits. It turns out that the Galactic Orb that was in Max's possession awakened the evil witch Morgan, who had been previously sealed by the elemental rulers. Balance is destroyed, and magical creatures have gone berserk. Together with his companion, the little pixie Viewer, Max has to undo the damage and stop Morgan from taking over the world.\n\nUnlike the first game, Shiritsu Tantei Max 2: Master of Elemental is an RPG. It plays like a fairly traditional Japanese-style representative of the genre: the player navigates Max over the top-down world, fighting random enemies in turn-based fashion, and visiting towns for rest and supplies. Characters have typical RPG proficiencies (for example, Viewer has low HP and weak attacks, but can cast healing magic, etc.). The characters level up automatically, as per standard Japanese RPG rule.\n\nThe adult content comes in form of over-sexed female demonic enemies, some of which fully undress upon defeat, as well as during Max's dates. In towns, the player can use the special \"Hunt\" command to locate the available girls. Some of them will agree to date Max. Staying at the inn will then trigger an erotic picture with the girl in question.","Publisher":"Agumix","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183434":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Shufflepuck Café"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"8bd90803-8791-4487-814d-0f38d5371db7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8b4052f8-2337-4b1a-83f2-62e9cbf3c284.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c4642c96-f89f-421a-941f-e5b74195afc4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c25ca969-4026-4854-944c-3f71651d49fa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5434a4df-f325-4514-86f3-d53b8b8a50b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"145d1149-12e3-42e9-bd00-1280e387fe02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5da93e25-6dcf-4ec0-8568-3315379045a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shufflepuck Cafe","Overview":"One puck, and only two competitors.

It is set in the medieval world of Forcelia, which includes both the Lodoss island and the continent of Crystania from a series spin-off. The setting is similar to D&D games, having familiar medieval fantasy elements such as magic, races like elves and dwarves, etc.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visuals, the game is closer to Western RPG format and attempts to recreate a table role-playing experience without focusing on character development or a linear plot. Though certain quests must be completed and events triggered in order to advance in the game, the player is for the most part free to venture to any city of the game world in any order. Navigation between the cities is menu-based, i.e. there is no wilderness exploration. Specific dungeons and other hostile areas can be accessed only by receiving respective missions. In such areas, as well as in locations within towns, player-controlled party can be physically navigated from an overhead perspective.\n\nCharacter creation involves choosing a race (Human, Dwarf, Elf, two types of Half-Elves, or a halfling-like GrassRunner) and a class (Bard, Fighter, Priest, Ranger, Sage, Shaman, Sorcerer, or Thief). Character statistics and abilities are similar to those of D&D games. The player creates only one character, while the rest of the party consists of NPCs that can be convinced to join.

It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/-XnSqVPh2I4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xevious"},"183478":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Bitmap Brothers","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"960cdd36-940a-4954-9aef-91c4853ae4c0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a97f7a6c-05b8-439a-897e-d27fbbced459.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ae6d9f9-4796-4eda-a4e6-cf8bbd185ea0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7bdd9843-2119-4cb4-93ad-29878572c8e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Xenon 2: Megablast","Overview":"Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature.

However, Dork is absent, and his sixteen-year-old son Latok decides to do the king's bidding, and even go as far as to confront Badu himself.\n\nXak: The Art of Visual Stage is an action RPG, in which Latok travels through the world of Xak, exploring its outdoor environments and dungeons, and eliminating many enemies encountered on his way.

Latok hears rumors about a man who looks exactly like him and was last seen near an old tower infested by monsters, which nobody dares enter. Latok and his girlfriend Fray arrive at the tower entrance and meet their friends there. Latok decides to venture into the tower with just one companion, unaware of the fact that the \"false Latok\" was just a trap set by powerful demons, intended to lure him into the den of evil.\n\nXak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel is a side-story in the Xak universe. It differs from the main Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xak:_The_Tower_of_Gazzel"},"183481":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"bb2f882c-de81-43ca-b11f-1ffb6e069ec3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1bed6483-cffc-48ed-bc0c-9174efc75f1f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"84a33234-86d9-4d1b-a8c4-df000d32c42d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"191b9da4-227c-4d29-b14c-b133ceb491fc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8184efea-0324-4d3d-9fa7-3aa3469f44cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f7c5b0d1-cfe1-4a71-9be6-a6d7efddc0d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Xak II: Rising of the Redmoon","Overview":"Three years have passed since the brave young warrior Latok Kart defeated the evil demon Badu, bringing peace to Xak, the world of humans.

Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still.

The game also includes a few fight sequences, during which the player has to aim a specific body part and charge a punch to inflict damage to the enemy.","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Fist_of_the_North_Star_video_games#1980s"},"183497":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Enix Corporation","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9cb53980-efe7-47d4-9b88-a1d4431b7e77.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"8a25d1ba-1670-435d-b76f-b153b3d27d0a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"71856d67-7ed5-47fc-8aca-5ccfe3acfc25.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"886cc131-e5ee-4f4d-b8a5-49d052bd3244.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"87ae521a-8b58-4c24-995d-3bad4260fde9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"489f7d5d-6cc4-40a7-998d-626e8b2fd3d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jesus II","Overview":"On board the ship Callisto, sailing through the Mediterranean Sea, are two friends from Japan - Kazuya Goshiki and Shinji Saeki, on their way to Monaco, where they want to compete in a motor race using their three-wheel drive.

Most of the passengers assume it was junk thrown out of a space ship; but shortly afterwards, several crew members are murdered under mysterious circumstances. Kazuya begins to see a connection to a Halley's Comet incident that happened four years ago, and realizes things are much worse than anyone else would assume...\n\nJesus II is a sequel to Jesus: Kyōfu no Bio-Monster. Though the setting and the protagonists are different, characters from the previous game appear in the sequel as well. Gameplay-wise, Jesus II is a Japanese-style adventure with a large amount of dialogue and very simple interaction: the player is only able to choose basic commands such as \"Examine\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", etc., without the possibility of selecting objects to interact with. Most of the game consists of visiting various locations on the ship, and talking to characters, gradually unraveling the mystery.","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183498":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Eiyuu Densetsu III: Shiroki Majoo Renewal"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d97586a1-c91e-4b3a-86b8-53c0ce1aca49.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"543eb4a1-b832-404a-93ca-6a2f748c8139.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2790c622-66b6-432f-8593-74411c124331.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"913454ff-2774-4743-a747-a42bcb5974ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"67371bd1-bca2-48f3-9f40-384bd42a1057.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Legend of Heroes III: Shiroki Majo Renewal","Overview":"Jurio is a young boy who must travel to five sacred shrines as part of his warrior initiation rite.

Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...\n\nUsing Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line Japan, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/w4RwlqaFq4M","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Police_Quest_II:_The_Vengeance"},"183504":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Discovery","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e951eeab-13ea-4b4c-9fed-b1586e181c63.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b9720592-5fe9-45f0-82a8-8be595c342a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5b97f0e5-6164-440e-8c01-fd0056c31fcb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b82c22d4-ed96-4279-92a4-344351f220af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"05cf1ee0-38aa-4b51-b9a0-402898708d87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"RED","Overview":"Investigation assistant got a letter mentioning Luna city and the letter was posted a month ago from the location of explosion accident.

At least he was ordinary until he met Mimi, the charming new exchange student. One day, being a perfect gentleman, Arigawa walked her home after the school, but was attacked by angry female martial artists. Mimi reveals to him that she has studied esoteric martial skills by a man known simply as \"The Teacher\". Unfortunately, not every one who knows these secret techniques uses them for the good. The young hero gets involved in a conflict from which there is no escape...\n\nSuper Battle Skin Panic is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. During the adventure part, the player clicks on one of the three available commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Move\") to interact with the environment. As in most Japanese adventures, there is no puzzles or other kind of challenge, and at most screens the player simply has to deplete all the commands to proceed.\n\nThe battles are pre-set and follow a turn-based pattern. The player controls Mimi. Both player-controlled character and the enemy are dealt five cards, one of which the player has to \"play\"; after the turn is over, the player is dealt a new card. The cards work like battle command: attack, defense, etc. A special card is \"undress\", which, unsurprisingly, makes the character remove some of her clothes or even get completely naked. Both Mimi and the enemy have a \"shame\" meter, which can be reduced (or raised) by playing certain cards. The higher the shame meter, the more the character feels ashamed of her nudity, which leads to decrease in combat performance.","Publisher":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183506":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tose Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"988c70ae-56bc-4211-a07b-9e475dcc4c4f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"13706fee-76e2-4571-8116-6d6bfa3d2132.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"517f1602-26a7-4c9c-89a4-133ebf368c66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss","Overview":"As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss.

But soon rogue organizations collectively known as space pirates began to terrorize space stations. This led to a series of violent conflicts.

The young pilot Gingie and his lovely companion Windy must defend the space station and eventually venture into enemy territory.\n\nMetal Mover Jastrike is a top-down shooter. The player navigates a mech through maze-like hostile areas, fighting enemies on the way. Enemies respawn whenever the protagonist re-enters a screen. The mech possesses a basic melee weapon, mid-range laser attack, as well as powerful missile and grenade launchers with limited ammunition. Defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups which may increase the player character's hit points or shields, eliminate all enemies on screen, etc. Anime-style cutscenes advance the plot between missions. Some of them contain explicit nudity and erotic themes.","Publisher":"Apple Pie","ReleaseDate":"1995-08-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183601":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"bd259fb1-0515-4fe6-9eff-5fd19dc02886.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f6c1e9c3-d0c9-44ff-acbb-d3a8e9942993.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e5ee507f-8ebc-47e5-9ee7-decfcccca165.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35ecd4a7-98ba-466e-a378-4dbf27fbcfaa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"57c0524d-ac4c-4012-b702-53d142eb5f53.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e9380af4-bc1b-48ff-8ba7-b85e583dafe4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c2cf6364-8eaa-4a7a-ad2c-b043fae5e1cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Maison Ikkoku: Omoide no Photograph","Overview":"Maison Ikkoku: Omoide no Photograph is a Japanese menu-based graphical adventure game based on the anime and manga series.

They had high hopes of building the \"Japan of the future\" and educating the young ones: the central place on the island was dedicated to a high school. But years have passed, and the youngsters rebelled against the oligarchs. Chaos reigned on the island, and even terrorist attacks were not uncommon. Amatsukami Hidehiko, the last (and youngest) of the oligarchs, decides to change the way of things. Using his charisma, but also more violent tactics, he goes to the troubled school to deal personally with anyone who dares oppose him.\n\nGakuen King is a peculiar mixture of typical Japanese RPG with random turn-based battles, strategy elements (recruiting students to join Hidehiko's army), and adventure elements (\"search\" command, finding and manipulating items), with extended sex scenes that have Japanese adventure-style menu-based interaction. The basic gameplay is that of a top-down RPG: Hidehiko walks around, fights random enemies, levels up, etc. The combat system is rather basic: Hidehiko's party (or, better to say, army) is treated like a single character - the player is only able to give general commands (attack, use special powers, retreat, etc.), after which the battle unfolds automatically. That is why the player also has to focus on adventure-like exploration to solve problems and overcome obstacles, as well as constantly enlarging the army to become stronger.","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183677":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Isekai Denshou Joshua"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Panther Software Inc.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c8115695-97b0-4fc5-957a-0d1f87c8e2a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"318fc585-3d8f-4906-bfc2-2f598b10adf9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"584fb283-8aac-419c-84ac-98bd001d51cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Joshua","Overview":"Joshua is a grand strategy game set on the fictional semi-medieval continent of the same name.

Gameplay process is non-linear; rather than following a narrative with scripted events, the player explores the world and travels to its locations in any order. Interaction with the world is performed with menu commands such as \"Attack\", \"Enter\" (a location represented on the map as an icon), \"Transaction\", etc. Enemies are visibly roaming the world map; a contact with any of them leads to a separate small isometric battle screen, on which the playable character can freely move, attack physically, or use psychic powers in turn-based fashion.","Publisher":"Square Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"183769":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TamTam Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"23cb62a6-ea81-4f75-95bd-023ea0f2cab4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"48fd12d5-ae7d-4751-b2a8-cd7227355ae9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"19d2d7aa-a088-4b92-8700-8a9145a9f051.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wingman","Overview":"Kenta is a Japanese teenager who is obsessed with superhero stories.

An era of relative peace and stability followed, which soon was disrupted by armed conflicts between different countries and internal turmoil on Marmo.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is a Western-style role-playing game, its Japanese origins and anime aesthetics notwithstanding. Visually and gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the previous game. The player creates a party of heroes (up to six active characters), selecting between four races and seven classes. The party is then free to explore much of the continent in a non-linear fashion, visiting towns and exploring pseudo-3D first-person maze-like dungeons.

The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.\n\nAfter the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.\n\nBattles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"183773":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Lodoss Tou Senki: Fukujinzuke"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Genres":"Action; Puzzle; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"ca1ac975-2e8d-4920-9fb0-e968358d8ffe.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"48c5ca2c-7290-4958-95a5-fc50da3f26a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b71d6b79-7883-4445-a653-b0160d98f0da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Record of Lodoss War: Fukujinzuke","Overview":"Fukujinzuke has little to do with the Japanese pickled vegetables it was named after.

When the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the Earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical Earth simply isn't there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, builds an interstellar ship. A team of four specialists is then sent into deep space to find unique parts for the construction of the Centauri Drive, a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect.\n\nPlanet's Edge is a sci-fi role-playing game with space exploration and other gameplay elements, including spaceship combat, mining for resources, trading, and light puzzle-solving. The game begins on the moonbase, where the player can access the shipyard, crew quarters, warehouse, and research lab. The player is put in control of four pre-made characters: William Dean (pilot), Katya Mershova (weapons officer), Nelson Ngatadatu (engineer), and Osai Tsakafuchi (medic) . Each of these characters can be cloned for different attribute rolls, while retaining their primary skills: astrogation and ship weapons for William; light, heavy, and hand weapons for Katya; ship repair and computers for Nelson; and first aid and xenobiology for Osai. Unlike most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points and can only become stronger by equipping better weapons and armor.\n\nThe game is completely open-ended, allowing the player to travel to any of the dozens of stars. The player physically navigates the ship on an overhead screen. Entering a star system enlarges the view, allowing the ship to orbit a planet. Though most planets cannot be landed on, a large amount remains that can be explored on foot from a top-down view similar to that of Ultima VI. Each planet is represented by an enclosed populated area, usually containing friendly NPCs as well as enemies. Advancing the storyline involves gathering clues from various characters as well as obtaining objects, many of which have to be used in other locations in a puzzle-like fashion. Combat on the ground is turn-based and can be avoided in most cases.\n\nPlanets can also be mined for various elements such as organics, metals, liquids, etc. These elements can be then brought back to the moonbase, where they can be used to produce better equipment for the crew members or upgrade the spaceship. Alien technological blueprints can also be recovered and used in the research laboratory to develop new ship models. The spaceship can carry cargo between planets, which can be traded or used to bribe hostile aliens. If the bribe is unsuccessful or the player decides not to resort to it, a fight against a hostile ship ensues. These fights are action-based, requiring the player to manoeuvre the ship in real time while shooting at the opponent.","Publisher":"Ving Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Planet%27s_Edge"},"183795":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished Omen"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"afa418f2-fa65-4cfe-8828-dce1cf73bacf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"62c5bb58-db5b-49c9-9689-52eb79e3bf73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cc9f7282-fc5d-4f7c-8f97-dbebdc6f5386.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished","Overview":"In this game, the player takes the role of Adol (Aron in the English-language Sega Master System version) Christin, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman.

One day, following a storm, the old man told Kirt that he was the last of The People - an ancient race that possessed the ability to shapeshift into magical creatures. Kurt's parents and the rest of The People were slaughtered by followers of the outcast god Malkor - former renegade shapeshifters who got corrupted by his promises of power. Now, Malkor's minions are after Kirt, and he must recall the techniques of his race to defeat evil.\n\nShadowCaster is a 3D first-person fantasy-themed action game with light role-playing elements. Utilizing an engine similar to that of Wolfenstein 3D, the game adds to it the abilities to jump, swim, and (under certain circumstances) fly. The game's stand-out feature are Kirt's shapeshifting abilities. Throughout the game, he will be able to transform into magical creatures, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, which must be taken into account during combat and exploration. These include a four-armed cat who can see invisible things; a leprechaun who can fit into tight spaces and unleash a swarm of insects; a dragon who can fly, breathe fire and attack with his tail, and others. Some of Kirt's forms can use magic, which requires magic points to cast.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ShadowCaster"},"184383":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Votoms: The Real Battle"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Family Soft","Genres":"Action; Construction and Management Simulation; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"41523f34-f209-4b2f-8672-f465734f988f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07161a64-f0ba-44ce-ba3b-6e5b59cadc8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"144287f5-f2db-420c-9879-6f0d4ad73a63.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"54333e8e-8bbd-42f6-99a3-d5831bd4d2bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Soukou Kihei Votoms: The Real Battle","Overview":"A game of armored combat based off an old anime show.

They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen).

A journalist named Jonathan heads to Arkham to find out more about the dreadful rumors, and to explore the ruins of an ancient monastery. In the town, Jonathan meets other characters with their own agendas. Terrifying nightmares, like visions from the past, haunt Jonathan. Will he be able to preserve his sanity and solve the mystery?\n\nNecronomicon plays like a traditional Japanese-style adventure, having no puzzles at all (even though there is a rudimentary inventory in the game). However, unlike most Japanese adventures, it uses a simple point-and-click interface for interaction. Navigation is done either through a menu command, or by selecting a location on the map of Arkham.\n\nDespite the game's connection to Lovecraft stories, its graphics are distinctly Japanese, mostly following anime-manga-style aesthetics. There are disturbing scenes in the game, as well as scenes with nudity.","Publisher":"FairyTale","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"184829":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Interplay Productions, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"2027f0a0-7176-4fb2-945e-bbe62e2fba63.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6d78816e-1268-41dd-91f7-51b67a109177.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"18e81d53-a7a5-4dc1-bef9-60f7efc3ce99.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3921faf7-1e4d-4eaa-9ebb-018ff2c69c56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0c4ba618-0055-413b-9457-1a932495e153.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Battle Chess","Overview":"Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle.

Hero and company president's daughter go there as guides alongside a tourist group of six women.\nIt is a galge, but it's refreshing that it does not take place at school nor with a student as protagonist.

I tried to play it but stopped when realized that it's a resort type galge with six random women. There might be a side plot line, so let me tell you about first part impressions.

Mankind had to colonize space, and began producing artificial humans (androids) to work in harsh conditions. As the danger was averted, however, the usage of androids gradually shifted towards mundane life. Female androids, known as \"slave dolls\", were used for sexual purposes until some of them rebelled and turned to crime. Special agents called \"hunters\" were dispatched to capture rogue slave dolls. Ryō Kanō is one of those hunters, and he is sent on a mission to apprehend an android named Reira.\n\nReira is a Japanese-style adventure game. The game is set entirely in an android factory, and much of the gameplay is dedicated to selecting sub-locations from a menu and triggering events that advance the plot. Often it is necessary to select (sometimes repeatedly) various verb-object combinations in order to be able to leave a location and attempt to trigger the next scene.","Publisher":"Silky's","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"185104":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Glodia","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"9e20dbde-7776-4ce5-bb6c-ec742a3bc179.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a519b417-18a1-42d9-87fb-f6bf0c546965.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bdd81554-1972-461f-9ef5-078692027b36.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb02619d-aa99-4629-aceb-20a609b7d4ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"abaf8940-acb7-46d1-879b-206b5d66b453.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1570f62f-19d6-4f14-b3f0-9fc4985d45c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Different Realm: Kuon no Kenja","Overview":"The Millennium Science Laboratory is proud to present its most recent and daring discovery: the Energy Shell.

You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation.\n\nIf you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working.\n\nThere are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them).\n\nNot all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World.\n\nScientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur.\n\nHow your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.","Publisher":"MicroProse Japan K.K.","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Civilization_(video_game)"},"185660":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Renovation Game","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"44099c59-a990-475f-9c7f-27c2b6fdbdfa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ea3ccfb-00b0-42a3-83e1-e5c1b8da64be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fb4f16b1-ac9b-4820-b8c8-cd5365459527.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7084e9af-3fe0-4071-a8ed-f9490c2e6074.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mugen Senshi Valis II","Overview":"Rogles, the tyrant who wanted to gain control over the three worlds in the universe, was defeated by Yuko, an ordinary Japanese teenager who was chosen to become the heroic Valis Soldier.

Yuko must now travel to the dream world and defeat the new tyrant and his minions.\n\nLike its predecessor, Mugen Senshi Valis II is an action platformer. Yuko fights and jumps her way through enemies and platform structures, acquiring various power-ups during the course of the game. Various weapons and armor can be found in the stages and equipped on a separate screen. Weapons have their own unique ranged patterns and are always attached to Yuko's default sword attack. Different types of armor may increase Yuko's hit points, offense, and defense ratings.\n\nYuko can also acquire and execute special attacks and techniques, such as for example an ability that freezes all the enemies on screen for a limited amount of time.

Many years ago, two of the gods fought each other, until the god Gaduros emerged victorious, imposing a harsh rule over the nation of the winged Beasts. But the beautiful goddess Typhon defeated Gaduros. It looked like the age of peace finally began. But when the Beasts discovered an ancient disc-like artifact, everything went wrong again. A warrior from the nation of Centaurs and a mysterious religious cult suddenly became very interested in the artifact, making it clear to the Beasts that they will have to fight for their lives. And so three of them - two young friends, Rezak and Maxen, and their older comrade Badio - started a dangerous journey across the world, to find out what their enemies' intentions truly are...\n\nThe game is a mixture of RPG and strategy. As in most RPGs, the player controls a party of characters (up to 7), who gain experience points from fighting enemies and level up. However, there is no exploration of any kind and no movement outside of the battle field in the game. The game consists of long strategic battles and cut scenes, most of which are presented as still anime-style shots that advance the story. The turn-based battles allow free movement on the battle field. Each action (movement, physical attack, spell, etc.) requires a certain amount of action points. Beside the usual attacks, some player-controlled characters can transform into various types of beasts. While in \"beast mode\", the character gains access to new abilities, but might lose some of those he\/she had while in human-like form.","Publisher":"Anjin","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"186479":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Studio Inferno","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"13327552-2989-493c-a87a-13fa2c638577.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dfb0fc92-b501-4339-9b4f-f80539250b1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c3c66664-c639-4598-9bb5-9705775a75d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1e3564d6-cf9f-4781-bf42-f927936f476f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1bad8767-0fc5-4b2f-bd14-547591d959e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Last Guardian 2: Yomi no Fuuin","Overview":"Last Guardian 2: Yomi no Fūin is a direct sequel to the first game in the Last Guardian series.

The sequel focuses on two of the previous game's main characters, Badio and his sweetheart Miriana. Traveling by ship, the couple arrives in a small city in the Eastern continent, where they meet a dying warrior from the Dragon tribe, who is holding a child in his arms, begging the heroes to bring him safely to his people. But Badio and his friends know it won't be easy, when they are attacked by a group of Beast Hunters, and when the powerful enemies continue plotting their schemes against the heroes...\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of the first game, with a few minor changes. As before, there is no exploration or movement outside the battles; the entire game consists of long strategic fights and cut scenes. Once again, the player has access to beast transformation for the characters in the party. The player-controlled characters level up automatically, but this time can level up in the middle of the battle. The \"Defend\" command is now available, requiring 1 action point.

To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1985-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/XyqUSUR6FUQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord"},"186821":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"aa9babc5-277d-44a1-89b8-0f154f7df1bf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc6e5857-6782-4073-8ab3-b960257204ed.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry 2: Knight of Diamonds","Overview":"Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get the staff back along with Gnilda's blessing.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/qt866B8g66k","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_II:_The_Knight_of_Diamonds"},"186822":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"baf3402d-6253-4a34-86ec-87df3ad74b82.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d88f7014-3384-42da-abc5-96724bf4ddfd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dcc2d1e2-332c-4259-a1f1-2847e4b984c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a33f3fbb-c23a-4722-9cd9-8b66387f8e37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry 3: Legacy of Llylgamyn","Overview":"A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.\n\nLegacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.\n\nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1987-06-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_III:_Legacy_of_Llylgamyn"},"186823":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e4ab659e-c4b7-4d75-943e-b24e597bd73a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3bff5728-97f9-42d1-9738-403d51fcdf6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ecd6006a-916b-4799-b944-ed2db616f337.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry 4: The Return of Werdna","Overview":"The fourth game in the Wizardry series, The Return of Werdna takes a decidedly different approach from all the games that preceded it. Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_IV:_The_Return_of_Werdna"},"186824":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"99e88b54-f58b-41fd-ae65-dc5e514b766f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7d510e7-6035-4916-8f79-cd55af77afb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"c1b4a641-1e2a-4d11-b738-39e046908ae5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom","Overview":"After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the \"Maelstrom\" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.\n\nWizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_V:_Heart_of_the_Maelstrom"},"186825":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"403c11c7-98f2-440f-80b8-ca1d809f7d94.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"17ee37f7-6047-4a09-a385-d7b1c8cb4598.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7cd4baaf-bb03-40eb-828d-7433ceb606e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1dd80176-ac88-4ba7-8c2c-bf3c65c4daf2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry: Bane of the Cosmic Forge","Overview":"It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true. A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.\n\nBane of the Cosmic Forge is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.\n\nIn addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.\n\nConversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without the possibility to travel back to the town or create other characters after the game has started. Unlike the previous entries, it is possible to save the game anywhere manually.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_VI:_Bane_of_the_Cosmic_Forge"},"186826":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"56721e78-109e-4d1c-a91f-2291306f4417.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"004c5c3f-c12c-42b1-9333-307a17f15bde.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97841f02-8c44-4741-869a-f3ea3adfa9ad.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"624c8ec0-862b-4764-93e8-9c68c6d3b898.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"27c2a9c3-c3fc-4a79-88e7-fcdc7830f871.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizardry: Crusaders of the Dark Savant","Overview":"Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the seventh installment of the Wizardry series and a direct sequel to Bane of the Cosmic Forge. In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.\n\nThe heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied with.\n\nThe gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events, as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text messages.\n\nA few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/NGQ4u6gZVx4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_VII:_Crusaders_of_the_Dark_Savant"},"186827":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"System Soft","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"cc3427b6-f40b-45e2-b280-de8b5dbeba2b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8cc29a69-bc1d-4d37-9457-4987693026d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab40b148-ca24-48ec-8344-9e75f13b3e4b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9520758e-be29-4c3f-8635-68d4414050d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Zero Senki","Publisher":"System Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ey7WOxrggzc"},"186828":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hervest","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"89d2a5b3-928a-40cc-b525-015de81466b5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"37fd86f8-7712-4ba7-970f-c03996bd156c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d2b2a037-4eeb-4755-bd7a-e574a14ac2a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"44add549-702a-484b-91bc-4691eba56744.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9ef97798-d21a-44d6-af93-5ce6369356b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1b3bff75-3b1c-4977-a1a7-4093cf6e3d17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"μ (Myuu)","Overview":"μ (Myuu) is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Hervest, which was released in Japan in 1995.","Publisher":"Hervest","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1FgwdV4cHBQ"},"186891":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ange","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"38bccf76-68d7-413e-a121-eab7822a7275.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"23c4f629-b01b-4f64-8dc6-aa79987f40e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b8836429-07d6-4fb3-94ce-a7c179eaeb65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"80bf9a42-cddd-4293-b1d7-8bd06efb797f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rose","Overview":"The young private investigator Hiroshi Musō has a troubled past involving amnesia and the death of the man he considered his father.

The player can create trade routes on land and sea, meet important persons, acquire and sell goods, set up offices in other cities, hunt for treasures, and be the first to explore little-known countries in the service of the Portuguese crown.","Publisher":"Artdink Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187056":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Himeya Soft, Inc","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"ab4003a8-2812-41e3-bf70-d7eedfd59d35.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c9918e6a-527a-4803-b93a-3151c54e21dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"73986064-16b5-4846-9356-333e93cedc0f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"393ad340-87b3-43f6-afee-dc3c85e23c0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bacta","Overview":"Jinpachi Tanaka is a paranormal investigator who possesses the powers of detecting and fighting demonic creatures.

Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject.\n\nSim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems.\n\nContrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success.\n\nBalance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.","Publisher":"Acclaim Japan, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Balance_of_the_Planet"},"187062":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FairyTale","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"d89f9414-70fb-4181-abbd-aec37f96e86a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f97b9042-ebf6-43c2-a043-a7e97354a8cb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92263576-8aa9-4e74-b9e6-08db64f53a6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7860118e-ac63-4553-b60e-ee8593ffd88d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"83ccd34e-baa7-4e49-8263-91a4ba38d1ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ballade for Maria","Overview":"In Ballade For Maria the player controls Jake Spikes, a detective from New York.

His son, blessed by his noble ancestors, has to follow his footsteps and bring peace and glory to his homeland.\n\nBlue: Will to Power is a Japanese-style role-playing game with many traditional elements of the genre, including top-down world map navigation, turn-based combat, simple leveling system, etc. A stand-out feature that the game shares with other Kinpukurin RPGs is the conversation system. Each NPC can be approached with any of the four requests: information, joining, negotiation, and battle. Many NPCs would agree to join the party, which can become considerably large for that reason.","Publisher":"Kinpukurin","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187076":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"a06de5fe-3df3-4bc1-90c8-b548d70848d6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15dce16b-68fa-4d14-9082-502ff3f44569.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ef3eda85-39d7-4eff-8e23-c2a5526297fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8568bde7-9816-43c8-abfe-5d4163623ba7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bokosuka Wars","Overview":"King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or turned into rocks and trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...\n\nIn this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/q8M1NAwpQnM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bokosuka_Wars"},"187077":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"c4ef8bbe-f2b9-4b2d-a244-e02e247ed76e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"503776ec-d97c-4411-9eae-ebb16bfcf86a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df64f1f8-0cfa-4ac8-9d24-0f8fc882e88d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bomberman: Panic Bomber","Overview":"Panic Bomber is a falling block puzzle game, somewhat reminiscent of Puyo Puyo games: instead of Tetris-like abstract blocks, little colored heads are falling down and must be arranged in rows of three (vertically or horizontally), by rotating them and matching them with other heads of the same color.

Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in Bard's Tale games.

All they wanted was to use the Grand Card in order to summon the Grand Master who would protect the world, just like the legends said. Surely they could not predict would would happen. That the Grand Master would be a sexy, but decidedly unfriendly girl. That she would quickly realize that she wields the power over all Elves. That she would kill all the Protectors. And that she would swear to destroy humanity...\n\nOnly one person can stop the Grand Master. A simple young human boy named Nemo, but with mysterious ties to the race of Elves. When his father is killed by the Grand Master's minions, he knows that it's not just about saving humanity - it gets personal!...\n\nElemental Ō (\"Elemental King\") is an RPG with several distinct features. For once, there are no random or regular battles - Nemo can freely roam the vast overworld map without fear of being attacked. Navigation is done in top-down fashion, while battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The pre-set battles (mostly against female elves) take place on a separate screen, and utilize a card system. Nemo can buy (or acquire from treasure chests or from other characters) cards, which stand for weapons, armor, magical spells, and items usually used in RPGs. Cards have their own elemental properties, so when choosing cards in battle, the player should pay close attention to the elements of the opponent's cards. It is also possible to fuse two or more cards into a more powerful one by using special cards.\n\nThe game is controlled entirely with the mouse. Like many other Japanese DOS games, Elemental Ō contains nudity and sexual situations.","Publisher":"Apple Pie","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187140":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Horror Soft Ltd.","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c87fdedb-355b-4a7b-a471-32e2e2514d4a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5d8aa26-08aa-453f-b885-73a41a568fdd.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bf9a1d7d-a2d7-4675-9a3a-88788743055f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7ba377cf-b35d-4b06-8725-b500462a9052.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c70534e1-e60a-4bf5-84bf-7f68c7a6afac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Elvira","Overview":"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is an adventure game.

Depending on the player's choices, the hero can become involved in a wide variety of activities, meet many different women, end up drunk, imprisoned, killed, or simply sit at home and play computer games.\n\nReaching different endings adds to the completion percentage of the game, rather than simply being dead ends. The actual goal of the game becomes less to find the \"right\" combination of decisions or reach the best ending, than explore every avenue and see as much content as the game is able to offer.","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187168":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"adf45e51-1e87-453d-8d83-805cc162ac6c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cd3f2ab1-2904-4579-b11e-f5c65e458712.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"03fe46a6-d70c-492d-9e83-b55956817a30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aebb4a20-1790-4178-9052-1af44d9623b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Erotic Baka Novel Series 2: Itsuka Dokoka de.","Overview":"The follower-up to the first Erotic Baka Novel game is similar to it in structure: it is a visual novel with multiple story lines, which take place according to the decisions made by the player during the game.

A group of survivors has escaped into a cave, and it is from there that the nameless hero of the game begins his adventure.\n\nSimilarly to Kinpukurin's earlier RPG Free Will, Faladia combines elements of Japanese RPG (top-down navigation, random turn-based battles with simple mechanics, etc.) with a more \"Western\" approach to RPG design. The gameplay is focused on exploration rather than on linear advancement with scripted story events. Instead of the usual Japanese practice of assigning a few story-related party members, Faladia allows to recruit most of the NPCs the player encounters in towns (up to 9 active characters). The player can also choose one of the four ways of interaction with every NPC: neutral, \"loving\", haggling, and aggressive. Aggressive behavior invariably leads to fight; it is therefore possible to attack every NPC in the game (though in most cases it results in the death of the underpowered hero).","Publisher":"Kinpukurin","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187193":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"365c3b60-42c2-480a-970d-5181bf6419ff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7c50b3da-3087-4b7b-ac20-65ab5078501e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8cc436ed-3be5-4560-bc1e-a971c83d2a0d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0d68cf0c-4b84-4194-bee6-27e80b28281a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"946def39-fbf9-4a02-bd7e-79513f4ded83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2dfc08bc-ff0e-4e08-a1ac-1f049ace2a8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fantasian","Overview":"The magical country of Luizard has been recently terrorized by the minions of the demon king Billades.

As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature.\n\nGirls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game. The story progression relies more on direct dialogue and usage of items than on \"triggering\" events by repeatedly selecting commands. It is possible to look and otherwise interact with objects by moving the arrow keys and highlighting the object on screen. The interaction is still quite limited, though; not every screen has interactive objects, and most of the time the hero is allowed to move between locations only when dictated by the story.","Publisher":"Great Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187230":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"78a8ddf5-583c-46f6-8ed8-789c0c510470.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ccc466e9-2c9a-4a81-96e5-fac03be84013.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40ca7cb4-cfff-4a41-8e35-2fdfff145201.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Goh II","Overview":"Goh II is a historical turn-based war strategy game that takes place entirely during World War II in Asia.

The enemies are a weird mixture of half- or completely naked women (demonic or otherwise), strange-looking monsters, or ordinary types, such as a beer-drinking or suitcase-carrying man. It is possible to talk to some of the enemies to avoid combat.

By the middle of the century, Hamlet become one of the most important industrial centers in the world. It manufactured food, medicine, vehicles, and above all - high-technology weapons. Until one day, the contact between the Earth and Hamlet was broken. Suddenly, Hamlet was cut from the rest of the world.\n\nThe owners of the station send a team of six highly trained agents, piloting advanced giant robots (\"mechs\"), led by Conrad V.

When the heroes arrive, they find the first level completely abandoned... except a few mechanisms which have seemingly gone berserk. The youngest of the team, simply addressed as \"Kid\", is sent to explore the lower level, maintaining communication with the others over the radio.\n\nHamlet is a first-person perspective game, set in the huge 3D maze-like eponymous facility. The auto-map is always visible, showing the player the character's position. Enemies and important objects are also visible on the radar. Whenever an enemy approaches, the playable robot is unable to move. The shooting is actually done in turn-based style; the player can only shoot once the robot's attack meter has filled up, and the rate of shooting depends on the robot's (or enemy's) agility. However, the game doesn't pause when the shooting occurs, creating the illusion of real-time combat.\n\nThough the game looks like a first-person shooter, it is, in its core, an RPG. Player-controlled robot receives experience and levels up after having defeated certain amounts of enemies. Attack, defense, speed, etc. get increased with each level up. It is possible to find and equip various kinds of weapons: a basic gun with infinite ammo, but low damage; powerful rocket launchers which cause high damage, yet have limited ammunition, etc. Two weapons can be equipped in each hand, and the player can switch between them during combat. Shields can also be found and equipped. Weapon energy, body (\"health\"), and shield energy can be restored with appropriate items.\n\nAn updated version of the game (with enhanced graphics and view angles) was later released in The West under the name Space Griffon VF-9.","Publisher":"Panther Software Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187282":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Foster","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"fdaeaa6c-c3e2-4345-bedd-c06c41953bbd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"64506c7a-147e-4ab2-9a4a-9893d46a17d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"87026143-4f0a-4e20-a921-666a14485d65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hana no Kiouku","Overview":"Hana no Kioku consists of five episodes, all of which can be accessed from the main menu, in no particular order:\nThe young school girl Chiko is taking a subway train and is sexually molested by what she thinks is a chihan (a person with the popular Japanese \"hobby\" of touching young girls on the trains).

The only clue Gen can find right away are strange letters written in blood: H and O. What do they mean? Why would anyone want to harm the young boy? With the help of the many pretty girls at the boarding house and its surroundings, Gen begins the investigation, determined to find the criminal...\n\nHoshi no Suna Monogatari 2 plays almost identically to the first game, the only interface-related difference being the addition of a mouse. Otherwise, the player follows the same procedure: look at everything; talk to everyone; find the items needed to advance the investigation; ask the right person the right question, and show the right item to the right person - all done by selecting commands and topics from the extensive verb menu.","Publisher":"D.O.

Luckily, one of the girls he teaches has a rich family, which sends her on a vacation at the fashionable boarding house on the sea shore, owned by a relative named Uminoya; the private teacher accompanies her.

He is taken to the hospital, and Mine begins to investigate the boarding house and its surrounding, suspecting foul play...\n\nLike the previous entries in the series, Hoshi no Suna Monogatari 3 is a detective\/mystery adventure. There are no significant changes to the interface, beside the addition of several context-related verbs (such as \"Take\") to the list of available commands. The navigation is also done through a menu, basically \"jumping\" from screen to screen. There is some investigating work (questioning, gathering items, etc.) to be done, but like in many Japanese adventures, advancing the story is often a matter of visiting all the locations and hoping to trigger events by \"bumping\" into characters.","Publisher":"D.O.

They can build hotels, hire chefs and managers, train them, get loans from banks, buy or sell stocks to increase their revenue. Players can use a telephone to call financial advisors that will give them information about their competitors, an insurance company to avoid losing too much money in case of a fire, a Yakuza member who will help players hijack their competitor's hotel (At the cost of extorting money from the player each month) and the police which will fine players for using the services of the Yakuza but will protect them from future payments to the mafia. Players can also take over the hotels of their competitors. Players that have gone bankrupt will have their hotels bought out by their competition.\n\nThe game progresses on a monthly basis and each time players choose what to do, the game displays their monthly earnings and losses. Economic factors also play a key role in the game as the game pinpoints the state of economy during gameplay. In order to win this game, players must be the first to build a chain of 10 hotels and make a revenue of $5000000. In case no player has achieved this goal, the game continues until the deadline assigned by the player in the beginning of the game.\n\nThere are a few events to look out for in the game:\nIn April, a tax inspection will take place. Depending on the skills of the manager, players may have to pay a fine of up to $100000. If players haven't hired a manager before the tax inspection, they will be fined $20000. In case players can't pay the fine, they will have their hotel seized.\nDepending on the skills of the chefs, the hotel visitors may get food poisoning, especially during Summer. If that happens, the hotel where the food poisoning occured will be suspended for one month.\nThere is high probability of catching fire in Winter. When this happens, players will permanently lose their hotel. This probability is connected to the manager's skills, as well as the state of the economy.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"187310":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SystemSoft","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"e6f68891-ab90-44e7-ab00-6b9cb78db7bb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0e20d91a-fea0-4547-b981-50a46b1bdf45.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e2bb4ba3-ac36-4b62-bf96-a09b5016bd05.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"87028f14-4fe7-4399-9990-8f5f4d410006.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a656c3b1-5f5b-4578-98b3-2d75033acdf7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8daa99a8-ae6a-47e5-af3f-96dd2f1a2367.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f7f75b51-3988-4479-9203-039937f8b1ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b8b67785-b2ad-43ce-b7ac-75f8274e833f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hozonban Lode Runner","Overview":"Hozonban Lode Runner is a variant of the original Lode Runner game, but with new music and colorful graphics.

The player controls a party consisting of Masaya and up to three female companions. The dungeons are identically-looking pseudo-3D mazes (with an auto-map), which have to be explored and safely traversed to reach the destination dictated by the story. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. Some of the characters learn offensive and supportive magic, used in combat or outside of it.\n\nThere are sex scenes in the game, all of them rather \"softcore\" (comparable to those seen in Knight of Xentar or other Elf games).

Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion.

He was defeated by the human prince Isildur, who took the ring to himself. But such was the evil power of the ring that it brought misfortune to whoever dared to bear it, corrupting their souls. Eventually, the ring ended up by Frodo Baggins, a peaceful hobbit who was unaware of his possession's true nature. Realizing that the only way to be free of the ring's power would be to destroy it, the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to carry it to Sauron's land, Mordor, and throw it into the lava rivers of the Orodruin volcano, thus saving Middle Earth from destruction.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I is a fantasy role-playing game based on The Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume of the Lord of the Rings book trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The events of the game follow those depicted in the book rather closely, though a few characters and occurrences are not present, and many quests have been added. Characters belonging to various races and nations join Frodo on his quest; these include key figures from the book as well as several characters unique to the game.\n\nThe game is rather open-ended, allowing the player to roam vast top-down environments and undertake side missions in addition to the main storyline, which must be followed in order to complete the game. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration, and is turn-based. The player has full control over the actions of the characters in the party.

There is no main story line in the game, beside the cryptic mentioning of a legendary group of heroes who fought demons and as a result became demons themselves in the introduction sequence. There are no \"main goal\"in the game, and no plot-advancing events; it is entirely dedicated to free-form exploration and role-playing.\n\nIn the beginning, the player creates the main character (default name Lunatic), choosing gender and background - social status, strengths and weaknesses, etc. All this affects the parameters of the character, which include strength, stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc.\n\nLike in the previous Lunatic Dawn game, the gameplay revolves around exploring the vast game world. The graphics are much more detailed in this installment, with actual locations within a city. There are more shops and places of interest to visit in each city, including the ruler's castle, as well as horse stables, where it is possible to buy a carriage to quickly transport to another city. It is possible to \"call the master\" in every location; some of the masters will join the main character. Also available for recruiting are various NPCs staying in the inn (a party can contain up to six characters). The NPCs have names and different abilities\/parameters, but no distinct personalities. As before, there is a real day-by-day calendar in the game, and it is necessary to buy food rations for several days ahead if the player is planning a long journey. \"Jobs\" are available at the inns of various cities, which include treasure hunt, monster-eliminating, etc. The heroes get paid for completing those tasks.\n\nRoaming the top-down world map, the party can enter dungeons, which are viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies are visible on the screen, and a turn-based battle initiates upon contact. The player can assign general strategies to the whole party, but is only able to control directly the main character. The party acts according to its AI, and the rest of the battle evolves automatically until the player interrupts it to input new commands.","Publisher":"Artdink Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187421":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fairy Dust","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"a08253b0-4d30-40c4-92f7-600d1302a5cf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a5ca660b-4bef-4f35-ab83-07581926718e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fe33bb15-e1a4-4193-980d-98c9d09d5ad1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ca0a78d2-9ae5-40eb-b39a-d642a8d3dde9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ma Doll","Overview":"In Ma Doll, the player controls a young man named Kazuya.

The first game starts as the little Arle attempts to graduate from her magic school by conquering the evil Satan tower. The second game jumps forward in time to a 16-year old Arle, now an accomplished magician, who must escape a dungeon and defeat those that imprisoned her. The third and final game in the package faces Arle off against an evil sorceress that aims to avenge the deeds Arle did on Satan tower back in the first game. She must now escape a dungeon and defeat the evil minotaur that has been sent to destroy her.\n\nAll three games share the same engine and gameplay mechanics, playing as first-person RPGs in which your main view is composed of a 2.5D view of the dungeons you are trapped in, and the rest of the interface is used to give graphic feedback to the player instead of relying on stats and numbers (for instance, a picture of Arle serves as the means of telling how damaged she is, and a group of gems that encircle the screen show how closer you are to advancing a level). Combat is turn-based and involves selecting and casting spells to obliterate the many baddies in the dungeon. There's also a fair amount of puzzle solving and plenty of NPCs to run across in each dungeon, all being characters from the Puyo Puyo series.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/sNp6lBnwOkQ"},"187433":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"6cceeada-88aa-4ede-8aa8-24dcbfc56454.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"27ac05d1-1906-49af-96f3-9c6fdb46709b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c00b0c7-5eb3-4ee2-b3a0-d6489071a714.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e5a36cae-98c3-4b97-9cb7-788d35c279e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cd62968a-1112-4b38-9eda-1d51e03d92a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Madou Monogatari A.R.S","Overview":"The heroine of Madō Monogatari: ARS is, like in all other games in the Madō Monogatari series, the young apprentice magician Arle (in this game, she is still a little girl). However, Madō Monogatari: ARS contains two other stories dedicated to Rurue (Rulue) and She-Zo (Schezo), who are known as antagonists in Puyo-Puyo games, but here act as protagonists. All the three stories can be played directly from the main menu.\n\nIn Arle's story, the little girl is walking through a forest and suddenly sees the cute Carbuncle (Compile's mascot). The little guy runs away, and Arle follows him into the depths of the forest, facing dangerous monsters.\n\nRurue's story begins when she is taken to a mysterious castle. She has lost her memory and must now find her way out of the castle, which is populated by vicious enemies.\n\nShe-Zo, who is otherwise a powerful magician, is just a school boy in this game. His class is having a tour in the ruins of a 200-year-old dungeon. While the rest of the children follow the guide, the curious boy touches a strange mirror, and is sucked into the dungeon, the way it was once...\n\nThe gameplay is traditional Madō Monogatari style: crawl through pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. As in other games in the series, there is a distinct \"wacky\" edge to enemy design, and - despite it being an RPG - no numbers at all. All statistics pointing to damage in battle, conditions, etc., are depicted through animations and text comments.\n\nArle and She-Zo can only cast magic spells. Being a little girl, Arle starts with only two spells, aptly named \"Hot\" and \"Cold\". She-Zo has a vast array of elemental magic. Rurue uses \"techniques\" instead of magic, but they work pretty much the same way.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187435":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NIC","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b6a8c096-33d8-44d6-8a68-0ca94b30a7e5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"43937525-6d81-423f-98f3-225808af2921.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6960c4a1-712a-41f8-93cb-a9766d4a9a67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7921c8de-a2ea-4d35-b1fd-40f824369818.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Magic Knight","Overview":"The heroine of Magic Knight is called Diamond Annabel Blackdiamond (sic).

The game consists of exploring maze-like pseudo-3D locations, fighting random enemies in turn-based style. In a certain way this game is a counterpart of Madou Monogatari: the heroine can only use magic, there is no equipment, and no damage feedback in combat (only text messages that describe the condition of the heroine and the enemy).

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.\n\nLand is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.\n\nLater on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.\n\nIf there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.\n\nThe main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents.\n\nYou can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.","Publisher":"Imagineer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mega-Lo-Mania"},"187465":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mischief","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"4ebc8f2a-6c36-40a9-9202-3f627018592f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ad3dca62-6155-4710-a89e-61f846976cc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b9f23ffa-2f00-4edb-9f4b-b1b04709a1df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"afd901c2-cc75-40d2-954f-e0b59344ada6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d3095f4d-f614-4e29-8ea7-0f1e46858377.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Merry Go Round","Overview":"Merry Go Round is set in Yokohama, in year 2197.

With the help of his two superhero-aiding pretty girls, Mokkoriman is out for justice, revenge, and mutual SEX.\n\nMokkoriman RPG mostly plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map, random turn-based battles, party management, levels, equipment, and everything else, albeit with a definite comedic undertone: the enemies are naked girls, regular attacks are called \"sex\" (with choices of one-on-one or group), instead of magic there is \"dirty talk\", and health is restored by reading Japanese porn magazines.\n\nThe game is very heavy on explicit sexual content; even during regular battles the attacks are animated in a very suggestive way. The game marks the beginning of Illusion's career as the maker of interactive sex scenes. The sexual encounters in Mokkoriman RPG have their own gameplay, which involves manipulating the mouse to simulate the movements of the player character during intimate moments. Some of the sex scenes are animated, making the game a RPG pioneer in this field.","Publisher":"Illusion","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187478":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Inter Heart","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"6b7eb16a-d76f-41b0-8de1-b6082bc8d890.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7a32a7c8-ae4c-4997-a88d-0d41750dc90c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aa0074e4-0623-461c-8f6d-b6ffbf89a27e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Moonlight Energy","Overview":"Moonlight Enegy is a Japanese-style adventure.

Now in New Daikoukai Jidai II, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:\nJoão Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\n\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. He yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great privateer in the name of king and country.\nRegardless of the character chosen, Daikoukai Jidai II is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number\/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: the Inn, the Item Shop, the Shipyard, the Tavern, the Castle, the Guild Hall, the Church, the Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncharted_Waters#Uncharted_Waters:_New_Horizons"},"187491":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e6f67e0b-a3f7-4b17-9bd6-be3071316792.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a9b61347-c7c1-4a20-ac15-cf2db081aa56.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bda64b62-888b-4f8c-a95c-4026d1d10803.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"362c12ca-cdfe-4c6f-872a-c5c6a876fba7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2159b33f-e3ad-46a2-a0b4-f867b8516f92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5d819568-5bcc-4de2-8f55-323e637e9132.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki","Overview":"Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki is a Strategy game, developed and published by Koei, which was released in Japan in 1994","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187493":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FairyTale","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a0283d0a-5ee4-48a2-b403-7e019c9ec0d8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"50d38ed5-ce9b-447b-9455-793a348b1c67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"820b9214-761c-4886-80a0-48bda3af37cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e0e126f8-9bbe-4c58-a5a4-c97efe751237.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nightmare Collection II: Marine Philt","Overview":"In the first half of the 21st century, humanity started building space satellites, trying to sustain the working conditions in outer space by using a drug known as Marine Philt.

When this counter reaches zero the game is over.","Publisher":"Janis","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187511":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Softech","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0df3a5eb-d1aa-4825-ae97-897e217ebb96.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73c21705-09ff-4680-8aa8-1a72ad35b312.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c639687b-a6bd-43b0-8658-168368e08117.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pinball Pinball","Publisher":"Nippon Softech","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"187512":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Softech","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"308906b9-dc33-46b3-b962-d0ae3c1304fb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"863f143f-93a0-4fce-a64d-93072e252797.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3be880b8-424d-4c4d-bf91-3340cdd001d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7b085779-9bb4-4004-8183-92b6774cb693.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pinball Pinball 2","Publisher":"Nippon Softech","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"187513":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sorcière","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"319038d2-1de7-4e5b-8762-6977b4638b05.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"66dd34d4-3960-4f49-b7ac-8b124b9fbd06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"57229aae-c0a4-484f-8a1f-f81501f119c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7cc25b12-a557-4224-9cde-90166165ecb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f9ebc3c8-a6d3-4333-9f13-aef077ce35a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Persona: Ingyaku no Kamen","Overview":"A series of gruesome murders shocks Japan.

Thus begins an adventure much more exciting than the summer vacation he has dreamed about: he gets to know many beautiful girls in the restaurant, and has to decide which one is the love of his life...\n\nThe game is a true dating simulation, with the gameplay focusing on making schedules and choosing activities for the protagonist.

To do so, she acquires a ship (which she calls Shock), and begins to explore the land in search of crew and adventure.\n\nPink Shock Pirates is a hybrid of strategy and role-playing. Rather than following a linear narrative with scripted events, the game allows the player to sail through the sea and visit towns on all the continents right from the beginning. Towns are represented by small pictures of places of interest, such as weapon shop, item shop, church, etc. Crew members can be hired in towns, or by performing quests. Instead of a usual RPG \"party\", the player manages and controls the crew of an entire ship (their number can get as high as 50).\n\nEnemy ships will randomly attack Shock. Before the battle, the player has to position all the crew members on the deck. The player can buy and upgrade the ship cannons, as well as other long-ranged weapons that can be used in battles without engaging in melee. These cannons have limited ammunition; if the player hasn't succeeded to scare the enemy ship away or runs out of ammo, the enemy might get aboard Shock and attack the crew. The battles are turn-based and involve the player moving the crew members on the screen, attacking when an enemy is in range. Attacks are graphically represented as animated sequences appearing in small windows.\n\nRole-playing elements are present in the leveling up of crew members, as well as in the possibility to explore the land on foot. The player navigates Pink over the top-down \"world map\", entering and exploring hostile areas. Enemies will attack randomly; land battles are handled the same way as the melee combat on the sea.\n\nAll the crew members are female, and during combat they might lose parts of their clothes. Despite these suggestive themes, there is no explicit nudity or sexual situations in the game.","Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187521":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft Plan","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"fe6cd556-de3e-48c3-8a9c-5d0f8648b241.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a3a9106-6087-48ff-85f1-f4fb9da66896.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"924a0c1e-57ba-4a2a-b43c-1ccaafa1c95b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"827cc479-2fb2-4884-9e0d-94cbca825b19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1a1c8f49-5775-4575-b609-d6353ce18203.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2c78d93a-8148-4df6-92f0-d6e1633b3785.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pink Shock Pirates 2","Overview":"After the brave pirate Pink has defeated the evil Temujin in the first game, peace was restored in the land of Thanatos. However, demonic forces cannot be annihilated so easily; the spirit of Temujin is still alive, looking for a body to possess once the power of the seal that imprisons his soul is gone. The king of the land is concerned, particularly because Pink herself has disappeared, possibly abducted by Temujin's agents. The king summons four female knights under the command of Sara, and orders them to rescue Pink and stop the forces of evil once again.\n\nPink Shock Pirates 2 retains many gameplay elements of the original; however, rather than being a hybrid between two full-fledged genres (strategy and role-playing), it is more of an RPG with strategy elements. Instead of controlling Pink alone and hiring crew members, the player controls a standard RPG party (up to five characters). More gameplay time is now dedicated to exploring the land masses on foot, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style. Despite the drastically reduced amount of active combatants, the battles still have a strategic edge: the player has to position the five girls on the battle field and navigate them over it, attacking when an enemy is in range. The towns are now viewed from the same top-down view as the rest of the game, and can be physically explored.\n\nSea exploration and ship customization is still present in the sequel. It is no longer possible to fight with ship cannons; instead, the player can acquire multiple ships. From time to time, a whole armada of ships will attack the protagonists, which leads to turn-based battles that are played similarly to the regular ones, the combatants being represented as separate ships rather than individual characters. As in the first game, the enemies can decide to board the player-controlled ship; a battle with a larger number of combatants (including \"nameless\" crew members) ensues.","Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187522":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft Plan","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"dd5d3f07-84ea-427f-bd37-ac327e1ae007.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a080c742-4b16-4d9f-a61d-5e21314c8455.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"941b5108-c4fd-4bab-b15b-d042ead2019f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pink Shock Pirates 3","Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187523":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ZyX","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1c1f720e-237e-4b84-a610-187e7bd46f0e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d276ed85-c870-4907-9199-2ed5372d64b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1e789868-9a26-4915-820a-24d36b709e63.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Let's!

The king asks an Alfa Knight named Romeo to escort his daughter to a safe passage, but war interrupts the gathering. Romeo finds himself in a coastal town, rescued by a nun named Maria, who agrees to accompany him on a quest to find the princess and fulfill the wishes of his sovereign.\n\nProvvidenza is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. Unlike other RPGs by Kinpukurin, it does not feature the trademark dialogue and party-recruiting system. Instead, it follows the simpler, more basic template, with plot-dictated companionship and automatized conversations. Enemies are superimposed on backgrounds, and combat is strictly round-based. Overworld and towns are shown from top-down view, but dungeons are navigated in a pseudo-3D first-person fashion (without an automap), similarly to Phantasy Star.

The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System.

Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzznic"},"187538":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rumic Soft","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b5ea8d5f-1a96-4b95-98d9-5bce55196aba.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"535b03b4-0014-48a6-a8bb-fb1d72dae047.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"45230f35-ff51-4eb0-8e8b-5b341682f33f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2574ad10-842a-4caa-89c0-839e8a4b3c55.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ranma 1\/2: Ougi Jaanken","Overview":"In a response to a challenge issued by the Gambling King that anyone who can beat him at a game of janken will earn a wish, Ranma and Genma Saotome, Akane Tendo, Ryoga Hibiki, Shampoo, Mousse head off to face him.\n\nThere are two modes.

One day, a mysterious man named Wolfgang came to her father's house, demanding a magical artifact known as the Staff of Freya. Wolfgang cast a spell on Alfred, petrifying him. At the last moment, Alfred ordered Tyfana to grab the staff. Then he created a portal, and Tyfana disappeared...\n\nThe young girl finds herself in an unknown forest, with the staff in her hands. Armed with her newly acquired magical power, she swears to find a way to return home and rescue her father.\n\nRevery: Izanai no Masuishō is a role-playing game with a rather unusual combat system. There are no separate battle screens; the combat takes place on the exploration field and in real time. The player directly controls only Tyfana, but other characters can join the party and fight on her side, controlled by the AI; the player is able to assign general strategies to them (attack, defend, run away, etc.). Since Tyfana is armed with a staff and casts magical spells, the player-controlled combat in the game entirely consists of long-ranged magical attacks that require aiming (the game pauses for that moment). Tyfana needs magic points to cast spells, which (like her HP) are gradually restored when she walks. She can equip rings, bracelets, and necklaces to enhance her defenses.\n\nA somewhat unusual (for Japanese RPGs) feature of Revery: Izanai no Masuishō is the leveling-up system, which is controlled by the player. Every time Tyfana levels up, the player is given a certain amount of points, which he\/she can freely use to raise any of the player character's attributes.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-10T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187555":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"7740bdd3-263f-457d-a232-914d4bfad556.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eed96355-e191-457c-b08a-0b74fa91149c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8c51e568-67d7-410c-b378-4aa03a7aebeb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ribbon","Overview":"Keisuke Murakawa is a teenager who used to have tender feelings towards his childhood friend Makoto Aizawa.

Mokkoriman is a super-hero. Perhaps a little unusual one. You see, Mokkoriman is famous for his... how should I say that... manly powers. That's why he is called \"sei senshi\", which means sex warrior. Mokkoriman is determined to make women happy (or so he thinks) by having sex with them. But the path to each beautiful woman is filled with dangerous creatures and traps. Death awaits our hero at every corner, so he must prove that his other super-powers - jumping and shooting - will be as effective as his main talent...\n\nAn early game by Illusion, \"Sei Senshi Mokkoriman\" marks the beginning of this company's long tradition of fusing mainstream game genres with sex scenes. This particular game experiments with platform genre. It is a full-fledged platformer with complex levels that have to be solved in a unique way: there are teleporters that connect various areas of the level, and Mokkoriman can use them only if he has gathered enough energy - which he does when defeating enemies. If his energy count is too low, he should return and fight more enemies (which respawn on each screen). Mokkoriman has no melee attack: he shoots small energy balls at enemies. Various upgrades can be found, which enhance Mokkoriman's shooting abilities, making him shoot two or more balls. Rather than instantly dying when hit by an enemy, Mokkoriman has a proper health bar. Health packs are also scattered around.\n\nEach level ends with a sex scene between the hero and the \"boss girl\" of the level. Trademark interactive sex scenes make their first appearance in this game, though in a rather basic form: the player has to hold a mouse button and quickly drag the mouse, imitating Mokkoriman's movements on screen. The goal is to fill the girl's \"pleasure meter\", while not running out of \"spirit\", as the game calls it (read: premature ejaculation is not an option!).","Publisher":"Illusion","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187601":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Apple Pie","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"8d9e430e-53d3-4cf4-b40c-378b83e30f15.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7658ae99-575f-4443-8e4a-ba2f0eed7b64.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5555e936-9d7f-4a21-bf90-049d457dbca1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"920ec852-cbee-4361-9596-7309547edc01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b87f5bc7-358e-4053-b8c2-1284260fa8c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sei Shoujo Sentai Lakers","Overview":"Akira Daidouji was just an ordinary teenager until one night he had a strange dream.

There is also a light role-playing element in that the characters become progressively stronger; however, this is not affected by the player's choices.","Publisher":"Apple Pie","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187602":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Apple Pie","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"d218f56c-5022-4b1c-841f-777983f14bcc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ccf4e5f5-89a7-40aa-b64f-172607c134ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"43a2c2e1-e185-4287-9a30-84f0d9088d6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0dfdf7aa-de7a-4dd6-9c0d-ab709656a7cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"93e119e8-1e2a-4d0c-9d94-80a3e8369333.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8d77ca4f-4cf2-4e86-92ba-05b409fe12f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sei Shoujo Sentai Lakers II","Overview":"The sequel to Sei Shoujo Sentai Lakers directly continues the story from the previous game.

Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long career, which involves saving the kingdom and becoming a true hero.\n\nThe gameplay of Shinc is also very unpretentious: it's a first-person dungeon crawler with a basic combat system. Enemies pop up randomly, and the player inputs general commands (\"Auto\", \"Offense\", etc.) to deal with them in turn-based fashion. As per RPG rule, player characters gain experience points and money from fallen enemies, advancing in levels.

The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sorcerian"},"187620":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Virgin House","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1bf552d0-3248-4a23-890d-c7b50402ec79.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"62f8d50f-eaaf-43bb-9085-2fd0c1813f00.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"89c7ddbb-ec3e-47d3-953a-4e7928611f87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e5dcbfc7-6c06-4673-b1c8-771a06d8eab9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0c7a5972-98f4-4f55-85bd-604abba1ca18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Soreyuke Nanpa-kun","Overview":"A young man named Hidetsugu dreams of having a girlfriend.

One day, the goddess had to leave the shrine to attend a meeting of the many gods, leaving the girl alone at the shrine. The goddess warned her to leave alone a box of star-souls within the shrine, and that under no circumstances should she open it. Naturally, as soon as the goddess had left, the girl's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box.\n\nThe star-souls escaped, turned the girl into a small fairy, and fled down towards the Earth. She must track down and capture the star-souls, now causing mischief on Earth, before the goddess returns to the shrine. However, while chasing several of the star-souls through the sky, the girl crashes through the window of a young man who lives on Earth. She decides that since he can somehow see her, that he's going to help her out, and so the two of them begin their adventure.\n\nStar Platinum is an erotic visual novel combined with a basic card game. The player reads through the story as it progresses, accompanied by still illustrations of the events as they unfold. Whenever a character in need of exorcising is encountered, the game switches to the battle mode. In the battle mode, the player and the computer take turns matching and collecting cards that feature various astrological symbols. If one collects enough cards of a certain type to create a set, then the player can attack, reducing the opponent's health by a set amount and resetting the cards to their neutral state.\n\nIf the player can deplete the opponent's health, then the story will continue and the player will be rewarded with increasingly erotic images of the opponent (which can be viewed again later through the main menu). However, if the player's health is depleted, then the battle must be started over again from the beginning.","Publisher":"Custom","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187636":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fairy Dust","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"4da34cef-2955-4103-83b5-972b34062bbf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"25563c6b-28e8-4c84-b8ea-07a2acc21351.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"51801208-75b7-4069-bc69-552f2ce52f7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6cd222c0-3123-47c0-9273-9235c2b66598.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0a4a05b0-0b4d-480b-babc-65c7992b5f08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dafb6db9-d1ac-41cd-9570-438eba030161.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Trap","Overview":"A space ship was sent to the planet Neptune, to investigate strange disturbances spotted on the planet's surface.

The gameplay consists entirely of making choices. The choices are always situation-specific and don't allow any real interaction with the environment; there is no fixed verb-based menu.

Having brought up and taught Aress for 16 years, his adoptive father ends the letter by telling Aress that he's free to choose his fate when he becomes the king. Aress goes out on an adventure with his two friends to claim the throne and restore his home country.\n\nThe game takes place in a world map where players choose where they want to go. After making a choice, players will encounter dialogues or cutscenes which will be accompanied with a battle. Combat is turn-based with the players clicking on the characters they wish to control and moving them to an available area. When players attack the enemy or vice versa, the attacks will be shown in a different perspective. Combat is quite slow paced as both characters take turns to approach each other and land a hit with each character attacking multiple times in one turn. Characters on the battlefield may attack with different weapons, such as bows and arrows, swords, spears, clubs and other blunt weapons.","Publisher":"Gust Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187638":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"a9d6d0f9-e7ea-4b06-aada-c497af687a91.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"97f83061-e234-4556-a9aa-9dea7852452e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"078fd2b1-e111-4d11-81a9-687a9f71bae8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"21b1436f-f3d0-4230-a34a-bdd92e7cd10a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"96eade6b-f131-4fe8-8199-d081cc33fde6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"504efaf5-8ccd-4fe0-8017-0fdee1cefe51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Story of Melroon","Overview":"The story of Melroon is quite simple and similar to a fairy tale: the old king of Melroon has a 19-year-old daughter, and it's time to choose a husband for her.

The player assumes the control over one of the princes, trying to fulfill this request and embrace the sweet burden of matrimony.\n\nThe Story of Melroon is similar to older Zelda games in that most of the gameplay takes place in top-down, somewhat maze-like areas (mostly outdoor), with enemies wandering around, who must be fought in real-time combat. The hero can visit friendly areas (that use a side-scrolling view), enter houses, buy items and weapons.

There are beautiful women on remote planets that have not experienced the joy of true sexual satisfaction. Only one man can save them - Mr. M's friend, the famous Space Gigolo, Red Cobra, the one who \"lives and dies for love and justice\"! And he has just the right tool - an intelligent sex toy named Pakki! But alas, not all is simple: the sexy, but deadly intergalactic warrior Mangoose and her minions will do everything possible to stop Red Cobra! Be vigilant, hero!\n\nUsually just called Red Cobra, this game is yet another Illusion-made genre experiment. This time, we are talking about space shooter with sex. The player controls Red Cobra's spaceship in a pseudo-3D scrolling environment. The gameplay is what one would expect from a space shooter: shoot everything, avoid enemy blows, grab the power-ups, beat a boss, finish the stage. Everything is controlled with the mouse: moving it moves the ship on screen, holding the left button fires at enemies. There are three selectable difficulty levels.\n\nThe game also has extensive, story-heavy cut-scenes between the shooting levels, with plenty of dialogue and - naturally - sex scenes. The sex scenes in this game are quite mild (especially for Illusion) and mostly involve women \"rescued\" by Red Cobra using the sex toy Pakki for... well, what sex toys are usually used for.

Three great tribes lived in peace with each other. Up in the sky, the Heavenly Tribe; down on the Earth, the Human Tribe; and between them, the Demon Tribe. But among the demons, there were some who wanted more power. The members of the Heavenly Tribe were forced to seal the rebellious demons in what they called \"Path of Light\". But one of them figured out how to break the seal. The demons were now free, and they attacked the Human Tribe. Horrible massacres, ruined cities and villages, exterminated nations - it looked like the End of Days had come to the humans...\n\n...A boy named Anduke was raised in a secluded location by two female elves. It was clear that the boy possessed extraordinary powers: at the tender age of nine, he was already able to sexually satisfy his lovely nannies. But a mysterious force tore the boy away, knocking him unconscious. He awoke ten years later, in a human village. A promise given to a young girl led him to a fateful meeting that revealed his destiny: he had the blood of Heavenly Tribe in him, and was the only one able to save the Human Tribe from the demons...\n\nDangel is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. Anduke meets companions on his quest, who join his party. The navigation is done from top-down perspective, while random turn-based battles use first-person view. Player-controlled characters can use regular attacks or magic. Anduke is also able to give commands to his elf companion, who has access to many magical spells. The game features full-screen anime-style cut-scenes to advance the story, many of which depict sexual encounters.","Publisher":"Mink Co.

But a demon named Ibrus started a war against the god of time, and as a result the peaceful co-existence of different races ended. Humans were deported onto the Earth, where they formed five powerful kingdoms. The wisest of them, a king named Solomon, was known to have mysterious powers connections to the 72 most powerful demons...\n\nYears have passed, and demons attack human kingdoms. A young warrior named Shellstein is told to learn the truth about the legacy of Solomon, which is the key to defeating the demons...\n\nWolfish Gallop: Legacy of the Solomon is a RPG with strong elements of a strategy game. The player is able to move on a linear world map, as well as visit towns and dungeon-like areas; player-controlled characters participate in turn-based combat against various enemies, in traditional Japanese RPG style. Like in strategy games, the player can control multiple parties of characters, which can form army units. Different characters take the role of main heroes during the game (Chapter One begins with the king Duran seeking help against demonic invaders), and, beside \"important\" story-related characters, simple soldiers can also be recruited and participate in battles.","Publisher":"Pandora Box","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"187700":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mink Co.

Men, women, and animals lived together in peace. But where there is God, there is also Devil; where there is love, there is also hatred. The hatred between men and women grew, until it resulted in a bloody war. Having superior physical strength, men were victorious for a while - until female demons offered their help to women's army. Men's army was nearly destroyed. It was at that time that the hero, named Leopard Chateau-Lyon, appeared in Wandante. He is the only hope of the men, the one who will have to defeat the demonic women and to bring peace to both genders.\n\nWonpara Wars is a strategy board game which is somewhat similar to chess, but with much simpler rules (and decidedly much simpler than the Japanese chess, shogi). Some pieces are identical to those of Western chess (bishop), or move similarly to Western chess pieces, but have different names (\"magicians\" who move similarly to rooks); \"soldiers\" can walk in all directions, including backwards. There are also treasure chess scattered around the board, which can be captured by both the player's and the enemy army.\n\nThe battles are dictated by the plot; there are cut scenes before and after each battle, and they take place in different locations. The enemy army has a \"boss\" piece, unique for each battle. The battle is won when one of the sides has captured enough enemy pieces. Whenever the player's piece captures an enemy piece, a hentai scene occurs, typically showing a girl taking off her battle clothes.","Publisher":"Mink Co.

He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named man, who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country.\n\nWonpara Wars II follows the same principle as its predecessor: defeat the enemy army in chess-like battles, watch the cut scene, advance to the next stage. The rules for the board game itself are more complex. There are new pieces, taken from Western chess (knight) as well as original ones (ninja). The rules differ from known chess variants in several ways (random treasure chests can change the movement rules of a piece; many types of pieces can move only forward, etc.). The pieces also differ by gender: knights look like men, bishops like women, etc. Each army has a \"master\" piece, which represents the hero and the enemy general, correspondingly. Once a general is captured, the battle is won. There are also unique enemy pieces, one for each battle.\n\nLike the first game, capturing an enemy piece is accompanied by hentai pictures. Since there are male and female pieces, different pictures are displayed depending on which player piece has performed the capture.","Publisher":"Mink Co.

One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...\n\nLa Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.\n\nHowever, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong\/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.\n\nThe entire quest is played solo, without party members.

Meanwhile, Muhammad's disciples are also threatened external forces – in the west the Crusaders; in the east the Mongols. As the Persian assassin Sadler, you are given the task of murdering the Caliph, hopefully saving the future of the Islamic faith in the process, a process which will have implications ranging as far as 800 years into the future. First, however, you must find your three assassin friends and complete a range of quests, for this is an RPG.\n\nLike many of Falcom's games, XZR (or Exile, as it is pronounced) is played in a traditional top-down view when in villages and towns, and shifts to a side-scrolling platform view when entering dungeons, castles and other action sequences. Apart from equipping your character with an arsenal of weapons and clothes in order to raise hit points and attack points, you can also quaff potions to boost your points. Mind you, these are not ordinary magical potions, but heavy drugs such as hashish, cocaine, LSD, and heroin. The effect of the drugs only lasts a short while, and too liberal usage of the narcotics will corrupt the screen, or even kill you.\n\nEven though your party is made up of as many as four characters, only Sadler can be controlled; others do as they want and must be retrieved once they wander off to finish their specialised tasks. All battles are fought alone as well. Though magic can be used, it is seldom as strong or useful as hand-to-hand combat.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"187724":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Renovation Game","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d3e2c220-05d7-4ae4-8648-dfb0167ebf0b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"25e2041b-924b-4898-82a7-8a4e9c412320.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4168b81b-c7bc-46bf-aaee-11a1e2d8a844.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8a5e8cae-057f-4704-b9b8-4ecf021003d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ef2b6e56-65ea-411e-8898-d0d8f2088ef6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ca4609ea-fcb6-440c-a873-450c419c055e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"XZR II: Kanketsuhen","Overview":"After Sadler defeated the Caliph, he returned to his home village, greeted by his fellow assassins.

In the beginning the player character undergoes a series of trials (which may include arcade-style mini-games, mathematical tasks, etc.) which determine his eventual attributes and also follow his growth until he turns sixteen and embarks on a quest to find companions and defeat an evil sorcerer in accordance with an ancient prophecy.\n\nThough the game has a traditional overworld with towns, hostile areas, and fairly simple turn-based battles, many of its gameplay features deviate from the standard Japanese template. Every NPC can be approached with different attitudes (including bribe and usage of items), and often a specific attitude is needed to further the hero's goals. Money can be earned and managed through various activities. Experience points are awarded for conversations and other actions besides combat. An important factor is the party's stamina: a certain amount of it must be reached in order to access key plot-advancing locations, and building up stamina through side quests and other actions occupies a considerable portion of the gameplay.

During dates, the player often has to choose between different dialogue lines to please the girl. It is also possible to buy present for the ladies. It is entirely possible to set dates with multiple girls, but they might meet each other and become jealous. Girls also don't take it lightly if you don't appear on a date.

It's difficult to sympathize with D at first as he ruthlessly kills the unarmed and begging for mercy imitation women, but little by little we get to know that he does not have memories of the past and eventually he finds out that his own lover is also an imitation woman and is queued for elimination. The sound in this work fits brilliantly. On the shortcomings side the character design is somewhat shabby. That actually may be for the best since we have to kill so many androids - it's as if saying that it's a scenario oriented hard-boiled work and if you're looking for H look elsewhere.","Publisher":"Great","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"189248":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"13e23080-1376-41bb-af9b-ec91a95016fb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d3f28bd9-15a7-40f7-bb28-2d280044ae94.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5dc9fe35-8693-4445-a227-0a73fc222c76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ee3c46d4-f0ca-4a84-9383-8ca3fd50b331.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Span of Dream","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189251":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Genmai cha","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"609baf9a-8b76-4028-a7d0-ce7a990c1d6a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0136c60e-2e6f-40ee-8673-faf3b28bdde9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8b6d587f-c89d-4680-8205-87d4a9e7740a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7530b863-3637-420d-987d-aff10200a59d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9672f905-82c6-4316-b761-a9852d74ea0f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Steel Gun Nyan","Overview":"Steel Gun Nyan is a fan game based on the first Steel Gunner released by doujin group Studio Genmai cha, which is sometimes called Studio Brown Rice.

The PC-9801 was not especially known for fast, arcade action games, but Steel Gun Nyan pushes the PC-9801 hardware to its absolute limit to capture the feel of the first Steel Gunner. The port is not perfect, but it is still amazing that such a feat could be done by a small group of programmers.","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":1995,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/--wbdJYaiGk"},"189252":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wiz","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"2713f143-9c82-4038-aff8-03c30187b9d7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"16c415c1-fdb9-4478-9e48-f877441d54b7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"abc72fdb-cb97-44ed-9b99-5f1d1b22687c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c0a8bfb2-4d9f-4ec1-b161-a784c2937592.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3b710564-a523-48ee-8ee5-69a7c921c0b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"abff9190-a0e9-4e04-87d9-26fb51384bb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spin Ball","Publisher":"Wiz","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189253":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7b096495-ef2b-423d-8d41-5500908b239f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce05c5c5-2dd9-4ec7-babe-45918c372460.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"58a888e7-6046-4943-b654-58fb59afaf14.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ed026859-c3b1-4899-9f7d-7358d8e6e1df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Suikoden: Tenmei no Chikai","Overview":"In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu.

The only ones who can stop her are Takanoshin, the son of a samurai warrior, and the young girl Noichigo, who teaches little children. Together, they embark on a long and perilous journey through the land of Japan...\n\nThe game's setting is modern-day Japan with many anachronistic medieval-like elements. Despite its RPG-like plot and unusual perspective (effectively third-person, since the player-controlled characters are visible on the screen at all times), Crystal Chaser is an adventure game. The player mostly controls Takanoshin and Noichigo (often together as a \"party\"), but sometimes switches to other characters. The game has no real puzzles, and the entire interaction (including moving) is done via selecting commands in a menu; however, compared to most other Japanese adventures, the game contains more interaction, including inventory item usage.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/byIRwELEZIw"},"189354":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Quota","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e4e4d565-03f3-413c-858d-2f2d32233c13.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"238c361b-1d5c-46a7-b79e-2b33fb581a85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e42a14b3-94c9-4ea9-b883-0585e872b9ec.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"969d33be-de86-4c77-b771-15755c57e473.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8d0a4304-3013-4b3f-bfe5-5530a8a66b4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"58b026ba-bec9-4e8a-b032-3794b0968062.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Daigekichin: Nichibei Kaitei no Taiketsu","Publisher":"Quota","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189355":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft Plan","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f018b81a-9d8c-4a8f-8d4e-d01b432eb3e9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a6e1e9d-26d5-4070-ba50-058386fa4adf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f350594b-8e14-46a4-bf71-7a63e6953be0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"18472ad4-e62e-4d2a-89da-0dcdb2c6398f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"59eefdcc-bc2f-45a1-b9fd-070ef1c41e9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dark Odyssey","Publisher":"Soft Plan","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189356":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Artec","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"963b5564-5d3d-4c6c-b4f1-51d322451855.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e24cd730-72e5-4bd1-93c5-e783eb07a9e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c0b0c4bc-c5d6-47f8-96ec-813173f0d516.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cfcc89a4-d72c-4e79-bcca-a2a6ae391b58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dark Wraith","Publisher":"Artec","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189357":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"6f9cbe66-1b67-4df5-88f6-c83e3eceaf3d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1368ae65-4fc7-41b0-bbe3-e61855cb18fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a0cb248e-486c-46bb-bcd4-ca6c30b24a9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Diamond Players","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189358":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ArtDink","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3f2aeddf-c47e-4a69-ac81-349c828b78bb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"98a96df0-dacd-4465-b3a2-17e948044b02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ad17aaa4-323c-481e-91e9-1e36ce1ba507.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f4d67349-a323-42d2-916e-c4f55436fee2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Eikan wa Kimi ni","Publisher":"ArtDink","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/IHQfxjZdefY"},"189359":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8e4e4d4a-8349-491c-83aa-40edf92b305e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"d13005a9-d9d4-40ca-a8aa-1d613d2714b5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"81db6025-3d05-458b-9457-7e085af17786.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5c0be2f8-bc79-45f7-b822-9622597efc29.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8bfcfb2e-f253-47f6-8bf6-48d8f771c56b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3f2e29b2-a1c1-4971-b65a-0c16a5fdb83e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Eiyuu Densetsu Saga","Overview":"Fearing the wrath of the dragon, the king sends a young girl to the Northern Valley as a sacrifice in hopes to appease it.

References to events found within historical records are present but are often overshadowed by episodes made popular by romantic fiction.\n\nUnlike other historical simulations at the time of its debut, Genpei Kassen has remained primarily for personal computers. It's not as popular as a result.\n\nThe player can only command figures from the Ise-Heishi, Seiwa-Genji, or Oshu-Fujiwara clans in each scenario; other clans and forces of the war are controlled by the game's AI. Although the influence each clan has changes depending on the scenario, each clan has a set of general traits to distinguish themselves:\n\nSeiwa-Genji - mighty warriors with strong ties of loyalty; diminutive supplies and no trade threatens domestic security; specialize in archery\n\nIse-Heishi - high political influence and excellent domestic trade; constantly harassed by multiple rivals in most scenarios; excel in naval warfare\n\nOshu-Fujiwara - distant from warfare in most scenarios;

The protagonist is a man who finds himself in a hotel when a fire starts. Trying to escape, he enters a room occupied by a prostitute.

The game was later included as a bonus on the PC-98 release of Rance IV. Little Vampire is the direct sequel to Little Princess, and continues the adventures of Kurusu Miki and Ogawa Kentarou after their escape from Dracula's Castle. The events of the game would later be retconned into the timeline of the Rance series, with Dracula developing into the Demon King Gi, and the game's central antagonist, Ramon C. Burksham becoming one of the earliest-appearing Dark Lords.\n\nUnlike the game's predecessor, Little Vampire is an all-ages title, one of the only such titles in the Rance series.\n\nCharacters from this game appear in Party Game Hopper alongside characters from Chotto Meitantei and Gakuen Senki.\n\nLittle Vampire was the first game released to make use of the System platform. The game was later ported to DOS as a 16-bit application by WAO, who remembered it as both \"very memorable\" and \"very difficult.\" The DOS port was eventually developed through fan efforts to be playable on modern-day Windows systems. It was given an English translation in early 2020.\n\nStory\n\nAfter Miki's kidnapping by the vampire king, Dracula, Kentarou has managed to rescue her. But Dracula died too easy, leaving Kentarou with peculiar dying words: \"And now... I die in peace...\"\n\nThe two take refuge in a nearby town, determined to find a way back to their home world. Starved for food and money, they will have to find a way to survive and ultimately escape. Monsters patrol the area, whispering about a \"Little Princess,\" and a ruined church tower looms in the distance, said to corrupt all comers.

The plot of the game is rather simple: an unnamed princess is kidnapped by demons, and the warlord Oda Nobunaga calls the bravest warriors to rescue her. However, all the men are either gravely wounded or unwilling to fight. Nine young maidens join forces and venture into a monster-infested dungeon to rescue the princess.\n\nThe game is a pseudo-3D dungeon crawler. Most of the game is spent exploring the maze-like dungeon (no auto-map feature), solving the simple puzzles (such as pulling switches) and finding the correct way. Enemies appear randomly and are engaged in turn-based combat. Each one of the nine heroines has different combat statistics and abilities: some are oriented towards sword techniques, others focus on support, etc. The player can build a party of four maidens out of the available nine. If the entire party is defeated in the dungeon, the player can assemble a second party and continue the game.\n\nOtome Senki contains scenes with nudity. Some of the enemies in the game are half- or completely naked young women.","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996},"189402":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Allex","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"8ef9db01-4441-4f74-b02e-cb80638ccc95.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"50a59234-edf9-48b3-b425-11fbbd41885d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40189cae-ffc4-424e-b765-df8db0cf53cf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pick Up Mahjong Master","Publisher":"Allex","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"189404":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Allex","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"59c5a945-0765-4305-98d6-dcbe2c8d9a6d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f522b2ec-148e-4217-ba9e-afe296ea68b6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b8d61416-1a31-4d6d-a609-e16af28ab26e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pick Up Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku 1","Publisher":"Allex","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"189405":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Allex","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"ea1d12d2-bb64-4ee0-8273-f07562d24e0c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6adbae68-2495-4fd0-a637-9e05d3043642.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pick Up Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku 2","Publisher":"Allex","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"189407":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Allex","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"058a7fea-ddb0-4b4d-86aa-139c93f28094.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a05d28db-5134-4c76-821e-113d05ca14e0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"419a995d-3098-42ce-a084-670ae3e00937.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pick Up Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku 3","Publisher":"Allex","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"189408":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Allex","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"57966f17-f1a5-40fe-ae0c-70092212182a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Pick Up Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku 4","Publisher":"Allex","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"189411":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Allex","Genres":"Board Game","Name":"Pick Up Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku 5","Overview":"Pick Up Yadokari Eisei Housoukyoku 5( a.k.a.

Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.\n\nHowever, not all inhabitants are monsters.

Its employees are considered by most people to be winning the \"rat race.\"\n\nBoth versions of this game were released to an exclusively Japanese market. However, the NEC PC-9801 version has sharper graphics and the ability to use a mouse. Instead of abstract colors (to depict control of each square of the board), buildings are used to depict a typical Japanese residential neighborhood. A theme park is shown on an island in the PC-9801 version to depict recreational opportunities while the interior of the corporate headquarters is seen in the Sharp X68000 version.\n\nThe game challenges young people to create their own business empire by researching and marketing better VHS machines for the Japanese consumers. In both version of the game, the player is introduced to jazzy instrumental song being played in the background while neon pictures of various people fly across the screen. As of 2011, there has been no attempt to produce an English language version for this game either through official channels or through unofficial emulator translator groups. This game is considered to be in Japanese for the full duration of the game, making literacy skills in Japanese mandatory. Only the brand names themselves use ASCII letters; all other words use the Japanese alphabet.

Her skull was crushed - it was clear that she was murdered. Further investigation showed that she was working as a pianist. The police can find no clues, so it's time for the private detective J.B. Harold to investigate the murder and to bring the killer to justice.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins, Manhattan Requiem has realistic graphic design without any manga\/anime influences. As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no \"trigger commands\" to advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible. It is also possible to review all the data collected during the investigation in-game, by going to a bar at any time.","Publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"189468":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fuga System Corp.","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8f47397f-b361-4e8c-8ca0-9c594f87d4f1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box -

In his reinterpretation of these stories, Ueda recast them as historical tales set in Japan, weaving together elements of the source tales with a rich array of references to historical events, personages, and literary works, both Japanese and Chinese. In his use of Chinese compounds glossed with Japanese phonetic readings, Ueda frequently incorporates double meanings and word play into his text. Ueda’s penchant for allusion is evident in the Chinese preface, which is also noteworthy for its presentation of the author’s view of fiction as means of expressing truth.\n\nAlthough each story revolves around a supernatural event, Ueda does not stray too far from the affairs of this world. Like other members of the kokugaku (nativist) movement Ueda relied on fiction as a tool to reinvigorate Japan’s past, by bringing to life the aesthetics of antiquity in the present. At the same time, he presents in Ugetsu Monogatari some of the moral views of the kokugaku school. To do so, he employs supernatural elements, such as ghosts who revisit the living to make known the effects they have suffered from the unethical behavior of others. For example, in the story “Asaji ga yado” (“The House Amid the Reeds”), upon which Kenji Mizoguchi’s 1953 film Ugetsu is partially based, a husband who has abandoned his faithful wife returns home only to unknowingly meet her ghost, an experience which leads him to a heartbreaking realization of the effects of his infidelity.[9] However, as Dennis Washburn argues, through his highly literate style and developed narrative technique, Ueda avoids overly emphasizing the moral aspect, and the tales are first and foremost a literary exploration of human emotion.","Publisher":"Tonkin House","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ugetsu_Monogatari"},"189526":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microvision","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"2fef9c3f-9a1d-43be-a14c-fe48c899583d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92cf3a3f-3bc0-4702-b018-0f99426bad10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7c1efb12-d8f8-47dc-b3c2-1454fbb8414a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Umanari 1 Furlong Theater","Publisher":"Microvision","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189527":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microvision","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"74882265-3f56-4982-b0e6-767eb41c6151.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eeeea442-5956-4eb8-8189-7d3cdb27d2c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e81b0636-4dcb-45a9-89c1-e7d5b86c538c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Umanari 1 Furlong Theater 2","Publisher":"Microvision","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189528":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KSS","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0a08c375-fc96-4e78-824a-762c9adf8120.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"58b0ee97-967c-4c05-9373-92e37240b746.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e73c68b3-4bf4-4191-9546-ca5b7af0d25b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4ea42a92-6454-42b8-a9e8-d7cc9ea719e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a0858937-efa4-4ef2-9e9e-8cdea17d4bfe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wedding Peach","Overview":"Story based on anime series depicts the battle with the devils.

Her latest project is a spaghetti western being filmed in an abandoned western ghost town called Slaughter Gultch, which rests precariously on the edge of the San Andreas fault. Originally a gold town set up rather rudely on ancient Indian sacred ground, Slaughter Gultch was founded by a man named Jebediah Stone and run by his own private army of cold-blooded killers. Stone and his men were killed by angry villagers led by the local Blacksmith, and the town was abandoned soon after. Unfortunately, Emily's crew disturbs the spirits of Stone and his men, who promptly return to the world of the living and proceed to kill off the film crew one by one.\n\nCarnby is called to Slaughter Gultch after learning of the disappearance of Emily and her crew, and is soon met by Stone's Zombie Cowboy gang. Armed with various western paraphenalia such as colt peacemakers, bullwhips, and even a gatling gun, Carnby must fight his way through Stone's minions and discover Emily's fate. Along the way he learns some surprising things about Stone's origin, as well as a sinister plan interrupted by his death which involved the destruction of the west coast and which Stone can now pursue once again.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the two predecessors: The player guides Carnby through static 3D screens which regularly switch camera perspectives. He collects various items and uses them to solve puzzles. Additionally to using items there are four actions which are triggered with the press of a button: jump (only at pre-defined places), open\/examine, move (e.g. pushing) and fight. The latter is an important gameplay mechanics because many situations require a violent approach: the player either uses melee attacks or other weapons (with scarce ammo resources). The player has to aim manually and can set Carnby's and the enemy's life energy (which greatly affects the difficulty) in three steps.","Publisher":"AMT Savan","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alone_in_the_Dark_3"},"189555":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ange","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f469c15e-f739-4dd4-abe5-392bf2f18e21.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"502daeb7-9e3d-4ba9-8045-4fb8a4009419.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5b93d647-623a-48f1-bfc9-910db1d8d693.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f6125fd2-7701-4a23-be3d-c98082678e22.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Arbeit: Futari no Omoi","Overview":"A couple is preparing for a holiday together, and need money to do that.

You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape.\n\nAlone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models.\n\nTo escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons.\n\nWeapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.","Publisher":"Arrow Micro-Techs Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189632":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infogrames Multimedia SA","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"56da2a47-83fe-43cc-ac81-cf66a3dcf8eb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3b0e0f0e-0a71-4bad-826c-5a0587d9520c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fbce7df3-3132-4331-b2b5-085c42ca8502.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"148d73d1-d398-4112-b1b2-b2a0b905eee5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4d03207a-4562-4df9-b54f-5fde037b6797.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2866fb91-a29a-483a-9bbc-6cb9f8f8d81d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alone in the Dark 2","Overview":"In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.\n\nCarnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).\n\nNow Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead.\n\nAlone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery.\n\nApart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.","Publisher":"Arrow Micro-Techs Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189633":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"8009339e-b7c1-4132-a793-796e62a835a7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2e43afa-c8d5-48b7-891c-ac71c87bfa7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f37ad0b5-0e73-4e5d-a5e6-9796e11ff650.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Taikyoku Igo Goliath","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189634":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"5b6e79ea-e603-4350-9ea9-01be962cab01.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bc36bbb9-42f8-4884-b667-d1c526d232a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"20805841-053b-43ef-998e-9d10d026d066.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tamura Mitsuaki no Mahjong Seminar","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189636":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"acc35534-b5fd-4c25-be66-4c3004d09cba.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e869aaa9-a4e1-4eb6-a26a-39c51210b4cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"60d662be-158d-4a3a-b152-5ff237ba655b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tanigawa Koji no Shougi Shinan III","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189639":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Taiyou no Shinden: Asteka II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b6ebe63e-f708-4b28-b81a-c1bf9b304bd1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"c10e1753-c607-4661-8f65-adce22a44e91.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9a908761-8e9a-4692-95be-deef1cad8c10.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28c382b6-b0e3-46db-b389-b4fc9b55e0ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b19367ff-63b9-425c-bc18-d57d61ea0c70.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e912f174-d895-4a69-a2ba-8fad1752b7ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"562db9dd-b86a-467a-9e65-7dd9e67175f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Asteka II: Templo del Sol","Overview":"Despite its name (a misspelling of Azteca), the story of Asteka II: Templo del Sol is dedicated to the Maya people, indigenous inhabitants of Southern Mexico and Central America, rather than the Aztecs.

There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands (\"Look\", \"Take\", \"Use\", etc.), represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1986-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Z6yoFZZjN70","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tombs_%26_Treasure"},"189640":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Strategy","Name":"Tenbu: Mankan Zenseki","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189641":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"bdf60872-1d44-456e-9688-d33d22aeaf05.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"af650f0a-e49c-40ea-8ce8-d90312f4c4a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"53afdb02-b970-4d13-9b09-5ef5def53488.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tenbu: Mankan Zenseki","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189642":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"60326749-d4d2-4ff1-8280-ca64eaf83d00.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"4d9a3341-9ec2-4f55-bb36-4294c9691268.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"92c3d127-d4db-4fb7-bda8-28b00159c731.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"51643119-6df4-4fcb-97c0-e9af3879453e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f44cd3db-1173-4d9d-bb0f-3045b6b6dbdb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tenbu: Sangokushi Seishi","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189643":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Softech","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7a62b9bb-626e-436f-8dfc-9bd2251aad29.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d30b861a-b472-4f08-ab93-500afcfec6b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9895dba0-0643-4efd-af3f-1a985f91cf65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a7a9bab3-b814-47fc-bacb-e4b2e9e3ae96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tenka Tairan","Publisher":"Nippon Softech","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189644":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"System Soft","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"83a87837-33b6-45f6-9364-4c5e5c58a2fd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88247518-163f-4522-8eb3-83947f49f0cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c619d9fc-4811-4b65-af26-fad9c42690b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tenka Touitsu","Publisher":"System Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"189645":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"System Soft","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"be9ef012-e444-48de-af4c-87d967cd018f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"1a42aab7-5c7d-4efd-9d62-09189bc64875.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8f5ea534-da28-4af0-9ec0-1f7ea600bcbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"93e0a85e-9cb6-468b-9fdf-2ecc00171b3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tenka Touitsu II","Publisher":"System Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189646":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9147ef45-d628-4598-a3aa-ed7ff167f28e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70d3023d-3c85-4023-abc2-9e1c7778ed8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1415be12-4e0d-4906-abc2-cc6079657364.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8eda831d-d8cb-40cc-a3c7-96315d03d75d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ulysses","Overview":"Ulysses is an adventure game where you play the part of Ulysses in ancient Greece.

It is said that people were using devastating magical spells against each other. But years have passed, and the knowledge of magic was forgotten. Legend persists that somewhere there is the Book of Magic, the greatest treasure anyone could dream of. The legend captivated Nash, a young careless thief who decides to ignore the obvious danger and ventures to the borders of the kingdom in search of the treasure. Naturally, he encounters evil forces who won't let him reach his goal; and that's how the thief turns into a hero who will eventually save the world...\n\nSorcer Kingdom (no relation to the similarly named Genesis\/MegaDrive game) can be described as a \"pseudo-RPG\". The premise and the structure of the game (top-down navigation, vast dungeon-like areas, towns, etc.) imply role-playing elements; however, these are too light to consider the game a \"true\" RPG. Rather, it contains exploration segments and dialogue alongside action-based battles. The battles aren't very frequent, and can even be set on auto; they are confined to a small area and are triggered whenever an enemy is near the hero. There are no experience points, equipment, or comparable RPG system. The game contains a few scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.","Publisher":"Aypio","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189722":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Banana Soft","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"39e39e88-2c5e-4de5-8fa2-8a1a3f1391a6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1bb56e0f-880b-4556-889d-78359bf4dd5b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8364e252-5139-4342-a35c-2581bd9eee72.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4a3a06b0-4ac9-414b-ab5e-e8b35711fb15.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Katei Kyoushi","Publisher":"Banana Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"189726":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bell Da","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"20d1a05c-8931-4327-9920-8e5aa06bcd32.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08367fe8-4079-4d0a-beb0-9aba9b05e6ef.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c4c5eb95-736d-41b8-ba4d-45acf5b83110.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d217412f-56f3-46e2-8305-16be5e4d22bf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tsuioku","Overview":"A year after your graduation, you've become a security guard, and your first post happens to be at your old school, where you used to be the president of the student council.\n\nBut everything there seems off: the school is set to close, and everyone you knew seems depressed, or acts strange.

The battles follow a rather complex set of card game rules. At each turn, the player is dealt a deck of five cards. There are three kinds of cards: Law, Neutral, and Chaos, and six categories: Black, White, Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind. Each card stands for a unique type of action; for example, a Light Law card restores HP, a Fire Neutral card attacks the enemy with fire, etc. It is also possible to use combination of cards (up to three at a time), which leads to various results (for example, paralyzing the enemy while healing the hero). Even though other characters join the hero, it is possible to use only one character with one deck of cards per battle.\n\nThe RPG angle is present in character-building system: the hero gains experience points and levels up. Each time the player is given a certain amount of points to increase the hero's strength in the six elemental categories (Black, White, etc.).\n\nThe game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual content.","Publisher":"Black Package","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1997},"189766":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Black Package","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"0b28ffd4-4454-4cf9-b3c1-ec5ed7c95916.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ac51af2-819b-4980-b4af-6d865593fc44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"48beb11b-bad8-484b-ba7b-c2d538c192b1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kara no Naka no Kotori","Overview":"Foster, formerly a trainer of high-class prostitutes for a secret political group that used these girls to exert power over politicians, has has long been out of the game, as he and his cohorts were busted years back.

As its predecessor, the game comes with different difficulty settings, symbolized by several famous naval commanders and also comes with a game editor.\n\nShip Types\nAs its predecessor, the game introduces three different types of units in the game:\n\n    The frigate, small but fastest ship in the fleet.\n    The ship-of-the-line, the primary battleship in the fleet.\n    The flagship, well armed but slow. Flagships are the moving strategic flags that need to be captured in order to win the game.\n\nThe aim of the game is to capture all the enemy flagships while protecting flagships under the player's control. As added difficulty, new ships cannot be built, however enemy ships may be captured by boarding them.\n\nMain Map\nThe main map provides information regarding friendly and enemy unit location, ports, and certain waters that may cause damage to ships that cross it. Reparations and supplies may be obtained in the many ports provided on the main map. Whether or not supplies or reparations may take place depend on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCertain types of waters may be dangerous for ships to sail across. There are two different types of waters: shallow waters and dangerous waters. The larger the ship, usually the more damage they take when they cross those seas. This however also depends on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCombat\nSea combat enters a top down tactical map, where the player can control several ships at once. During sea combat, the aim of the game is to sink the opposing fleet by firing cannons or by boarding and capturing the ship.\n\nWhen to ships collide with each other, the combat screen enters the boarding screen. There are two different units provided when boarding: swordsmen (pirates with cutlasses, for melee) and musketeers (ranged combat). The winner is the last man standing. Certain ports provide different type of pirate units, however this is not explicitly mentioned within the game.","Publisher":"Broderbund Japan","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"189820":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Broderbund","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e83c45f3-d8f0-45c6-adee-b9d1bf7ad5fa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ecf7b34d-64bd-4284-8fdd-4f0ffe99f23b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a3abc340-6c24-441c-841d-8d7d5f95a1c9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Art of War Scenario Shuu","Publisher":"Broderbund Japan","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"189824":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"C CLASS","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"b0cc5aa3-d88f-43ec-b857-58ac5384c886.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b8e0deb4-ea89-4938-9526-c873736ada4f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bdcfd9f4-ad13-424f-85ff-8773c77655eb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"0fbe8545-1407-4fc9-b094-d2d05dc39b3b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cea6c5bd-6261-4d88-bbd6-785aaa339257.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5158915c-2cee-4b00-9015-71233e6c7ec0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mahjong Elegance","Overview":"This is a rather routine strip mahjongg game, featuring 6 girls and both 2 and 4 player modes of play.

He cannot even remember his own name. Ryuuna says that he was found unconscious outside of the village, with a pendant lying nearby. There is just one name written there, his name: Seraphis.

The party of the heroes walk over the top-down world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. With a few exceptions, the towns are displayed as identically-looking pictures of locations, with menu-based navigation, Wizardry-style. The random, turn-based battles are also first-person, but the dungeons have the same top-down view as the map. Playable characters belong to defined classes (such as Ryuuna being a priest with various white magic spells that can be leveled up). If any character is killed in a battle, it's Game Over.

The first set of issues (#0-#32) were released for the MSX from July 1988 to January 1992, while the second set of issues (Vol. 1-Vol. 27) was released for other PCs from October 6, 1993 to June 6, 2000.\n\nEach volume of Disc Station contained a variety of software, including demos and even full games. The magazine was originally published entirely on floppy disks for the MSX2, before changing to a print format focused on PC98 and later Windows '95. Several Madou Monogatari- and Puyo Puyo-related games and animated shorts were released in Disc Station.\n\nThe first PC-98 incarnation of Disc Station, Disc Station 98, initially consisted solely of floppy disks. After a year-long hiatus, Compile would switch to a magazine format with pack-in disks, resetting their volume numbering format in the process. The first volume of the second incarnation of Disc Station released with a 5.25-inch floppy disk, volumes 2-8 used 3.5-inch disks, and the final three volumes used CD-ROMs.\n\nThis first edition had for example the first of a series of Nazo Puyo puzzles. Similar, but not identical, to the standalone PC-98 game.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"190066":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","Images":[{"FileName":"d4fa7402-77a9-4037-a58f-d1746df5013a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"31093f4e-6864-4279-a6a7-81c52d34aeaf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box -

Both follow the same principle: the player sees a screen with hidden tiles, and the goal is to uncover them and match identically-looking ones. Each time the player selects a wrong tile, he loses a \"life\". The difference between the mode is rather self-explanatory: in the word-matching mode, the player matches Chinese characters (\"kanji\") instead of pictures. Stages and rounds become more difficult as the game advances, with more different pictures\/words to match, less \"lives\" etc.","Publisher":"D.O.

The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.\n\nThe game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.\n\nThere are two scenarios available in the game:\nWarlords: 1560 A.D.\nThe first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.\n\nNobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.\nThe second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rZirJHUrtRI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nobunaga%27s_Ambition#Games"},"190999":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"4c7961e1-43c4-49c5-b595-7e5672ef92d6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"58399a57-205d-49e3-9aa4-0d8e5e272399.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a8effabe-9921-4621-a544-dda0b427d6b2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8f474b97-997b-4c15-a773-6990798287d1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"edf40de6-47ca-4e0a-bb88-1e7c8d6126b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"38147406-d6e8-4b12-ab8a-1a6992672f92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b0f2edc1-f5d7-432e-9014-2690e78ec1bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkoku-ban","Overview":"In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku (\"Warring States\") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nNobunaga no Yabou: Zenkoku-ban (Nobunaga's Ambition) is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\n\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aHZF3ipHkBs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nobunaga%27s_Ambition#Games"},"191000":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"a4c94c8c-9f48-45c8-8450-8de1b37cba88.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"466a094c-7d9f-4719-b452-25d7e9195451.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b72917d5-67fc-4dd5-bffd-cdbd9139b40e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6a90497c-90e6-4b9c-8976-6ca2f042d4bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Nobunaga no Yabou","Overview":"Players assume the mantle of either Nobunaga Oda or Shingen Takeda and strive to conquer the entire land (17 areas in the Kansai and central Japan region).

Next part drifted away from suspense into eroticism and generally considered weak. So now we come to part 3 which is spiritual follower of original. Graphics are more anime-style compared to realistic style of previous games. A feature of this game is cuts from the viewpoint of the criminal which rose interest greatly. One by one new murders take place and inter-human connections of the victims get exposed. And the story has an adult feel and look. With those criminal cuts it's watched almost as dorama and all the tension brings to a satisfaction in the end. So it's a masterpiece work of its time.","Publisher":"FairyTale","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"191253":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FairyTale","Genres":"Visual Novel","MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lam-Mal","Overview":"Yagyu Jubei orders secret order ninja Ranmaru to investigate Yoshiwara murder case and you are an assistant of Ranmaru.\nThe story looks serious with the Edo period Joy resistance as a theme, but actually story is all messed up from youkai to the aliens.

The girl he saved turned out to be Cecil, the princess of Barran! Watching how the princess was taken back to the castle by a zealous knight, Rune swears that he will do anything to become worthy of her love. And his friends (all of whom happen to be girls) have no choice but to help him!\n\nLast Crusader is an RPG with several distinguishing features. The player controls a large party of six people. There are no random battles: enemies can be seen walking around. Once the player character and the enemy have contact, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. The turn-based battles have a strategy element: it is possible to move characters on the battlefield, and attack physically when enemies are close. There is a variety of healing, supporting, and offensive magical spells in the game. Characters belong to different classes (warrior, priest, etc.), and have access to different abilities.\n\nProbably the most unusual (for a Japanese RPG) feature of the game is the player-controlled leveling up. Experience points do not turn into better character parameters automatically, but have to be allocated by the player, increasing attributes such as HP, strength, stamina, magic power, etc.\n\nThe game contains several scenes with nudity and can therefore be classified as adult; however, overall the sexual content is rather mild.","Publisher":"FairyTale","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"191519":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FairyTale","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"50247f50-3aae-4d8d-9663-65680edd180b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shinjuku Monogatari","Overview":"Ibuki inherited an antique store, but to survive he takes side jobs as well.

Nothing but sand everywhere - it's hard to believe that 500 years ago a powerful civilization based on magic existed there, the miraculous land of Grad. Rumors of ancient magical items still hidden somewhere in this place have brought the young man to this barren wasteland. But the only thing he finds is a strange disc. As he picks it up, the disc glows, and a young girl appears in front of the astonished traveler. She says that her name is Physis and that she must find the underground palace of Grad, refusing to explain more. The hero, being the gentleman that he is, offers his help as the bodyguard. Physis leads the way, and together they venture into the deep, dark dungeon...\n\nGize! XIX is a first-person dungeon-crawler with very simple gameplay. Most of the game is spent in the same location - the underground passages of the ancient Grad. The player navigates the hero through maze-like passages, with only his compass helping him to find the right way. Enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. There are no equipment, items, or money in the game. Healing can be performed only though magic. Various companions will join the hero and offer their assistance in battles (such as healing spells). Only one companion can join at a time. The hero and Physis level up automatically after having accumulated enough experience points from defeated enemies.\n\nThe game contains nudity and sexual situations during some of the cut-scenes, but no explicit \"hardcore\" scenes.","Publisher":"FairyTale","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"191566":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FairyTale","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"8d83d533-d49c-4aa3-9f50-8d6fdc30cafe.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yumeji: Asakusa Kitan","Overview":"The hero is a painter who got famous for a painting of a girl.

And to get to the essence of a woman they went to a strip show.\nAgain FairyTale and again quite an experimental work. Picture is again in sepia tone. Setting is Taisho democracy era which is rather unusual. Unlike Shinjuku Monogatari there are a lot of still standing CG and models here. It's more like a literature work, but with a rather weak ending. And due to the Saori incident just several months before the game's release, most of the H scenes were self-corrected.

The game has no real story, being instead composed of five unrelated vignettes, short episodes that feature a sexy high school girl, a male protagonist (named \"God\" by default), and various comical and erotic situations under different circumstances: meeting in a school, haunted house, crowded train station, etc.\n\nThe gameplay walks the middle ground between a \"normal\" Japanese-style adventure and a visual novel. There are verb commands and sometimes also vast sub-menus with objects that allow text-based interaction; however, many segments are very straightforward and only involve occasional choice-making.

All the three share traditional Japanese adventure gameplay, with \"Look - Talk - Think\" verb command pattern, no inventory, no puzzles, and plenty of text.\n\nThe first one can be played as either of its two main characters - the boy Aruto or the girl Kyoko. Both are not what they seem to be: Aruto is working for a registry organization in the World of the Dead, and he has to bring Kyoko to judgment, where it will be decided whether she goes to heaven or hell after death. However, Kyoko is actually an angel, whose goal is to save Aruto from killing himself. Both characters have special bars - the well-being of the protagonist and the proximity of the opponent to the protagonist's goal. Command choices can increase or decrease either of these statistics. Wrong choices can lead to Game Over.\n\nThe second scenario casts the player in the role of a high-school student named Yoshihiko, who is hired by a gym teacher to take erotic pictures of high-school girls and bring them to him. This scenario allows movement through school locations (menu command \"Move\"), and, depending on the player's choices, Yoshihiko can succeed in taking the most erotically satisfying pictures, or achieve one of the \"bad\" endings.\n\nThe third scenario is a realistic depiction of a relationship between a young man named Eiji and his little sister Miwa. The player can choose to play as either one of them. Eiji is dating Miwa's schoolmate, and Miwa tries to understand the change in her own feelings. In this episode, the gameplay is rather straight-forward Japanese adventure.","Publisher":"Flat","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"192060":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Foresight","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"5692dfa4-6875-4d30-b961-05bed4161d93.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"690c273d-8c36-4b5f-ba40-425b2e567b4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"227fe433-bc95-4171-b979-b420eaa35eba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mahjong Bishoujoden Ripple","Overview":"As gods created the Earth, a divine woman, blessed with three powers, descended upon it. These three powers were: the power of eternal youth; the power of making thoughts into reality; and finally, the power to bestow these powers on others. The goddess lived in a forest, and her powers created living beings. Eventually, the human beings forgot about the goddess, abandoned the sacred forest, and her story became myth... until one day, the goddess is is threatened by those humans who want to invade her world and the world of other spiritual beings. Only one person can stop the madness - a young, pretty female warrior named Ripple. Her skill in the game of mahjong is the only way to stop evil!!..\n\nRipple is essentially a mixture of RPG and the Chinese game mahjong. Like in most Japanese RPGs, Ripple walks on the world map in top-down fashion, visiting towns to buy supplies, chat with NPCs, rest, etc. Instead of participating in \"normal\" battles, however, Ripple plays mahjong with her opponents. Better stats and new combinations are acquired by winning these games, new areas are unlocked and the story advances after successfully winning pre-set mahjong encounters.","Publisher":"Foresight","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"192061":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Foresight","Genres":"Board Game","MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mandarake Ichizoku","Publisher":"Foresight","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"192062":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Forest","Genres":"Board Game","MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hop Step Jump","Overview":"Hot Step Jump is a strip mahjong game with a background story. The hero, a young man named Byakko, is back to his home town. Several years ago, when he was too young and not considerate enough, he convinced a girl named Reiko to play strip mahjong with him. Later the hero understood that what he did was wrong; Reiko was just a child back then. His atonement was perhaps a bit strange; he traveled to China, and studied there the game of mahjong. So now he is back, and he is determined to invite the now fully-grown Reiko (and other pretty girls in the town) to... more strip mahjong games!\n\nThe game unfolds pretty much the way you'd expect from a strip mahjong game: the player must beat the girls in mahjong, one by one. Each time a girl loses, she removes an article of her clothes.

It turns out that this Wonderland isn't that bad - but how hard will it be to conquer the hearts of its pretty inhabitants?..\n\nNight Shifter is an adventure game.

So is this game, real masterpiece, but completely forgotten. The game starts very lightly as a comedy but with experience and story progression it gets heavily serious. Leveling up is well synchronized with the story events, so you see Seth to grow stronger just at the right moment and it really looks like lvl up affects the character of Seth each time - so there is great pleasure in watching Seth grow. He's not a hero, but he has strong motivation (princess promised to kiss 1000th adventurer to go to this dungeon and it was Seth) and he works hard every day. One nice feature was that the equipment was of multiple sizes like S, M, L and according to the kind of food taken in the shape of body was changing - in other words it was easy to find yourself not fitting in your favorite suit of armor, so in a way it was also a diet RPG. Game's not perfect - it's more complex than traditional RPGs so might not suit total newbies and it requires much tolerance to move step by step to the aim.

Characters can also push stones, and use special abilities to help Meiria achieve her goal.\n\nThe game also has light RPG elements. Characters in the party have hit points, and various healing and offensive items can be found during puzzle stages. There are a few dungeons in the game, but they contain no enemies. The few turn-based battles occur as dictated by the plot, and can be won using strategic combinations of physical attacks, magic, and items.

On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...\n\nLaplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective.

The trick is that the company is interested in erotic pictures of semi- or completely nude models, so the hero must use all his charm in order to convince the models to do so...\n\nAlice-tachi no Gogo can be considered an adventure game with RPG angle. The main challenge of the game is to explore the huge, complex Expo area, finding people and items needed to gain access to new locations. However, there is also an RPG system in the game, even though many typical RPG elements (combat, equipment, etc.) are absent. The hero has a health bar, which is depleted whenever he tries to convince a girl to undress. In a sense, encounters with girls in the pavilions are equivalent to battles in other RPGs: some girls are too \"strong\", and the hero has to level up before he can \"fight\" them.

The next day, when he goes to school, an earthquake occurs, and he is miraculously taken into another world, where he meets the girl from his dreams. She says that girls in different dimensions are in grave danger, and Shounosuke has to save them...\n\nBomber Quest has elements of both strategy\/puzzle game and RPG. Each of the six girls has a different scenario, accessible from the beginning. Each scenario puts the player character into a top-down environment. Shounosuke has to build a maze to access its locations. The maze is built from small pieces taken from Tetris. The player can rotate the pieces and then place them onto the ground. The goal is to build a maze that would cover possibly large ground, gaining access to important locations and items. Visiting uncovered locations in the right order leads to cut scenes, which advance the plot.\n\nShounosuke will be randomly attacked by enemies during his wanderings through the mazes. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective and are turn-based. Shounosuke can only use physical attacks and items.

One day, the lead singer of the group, Leyla, was kidnapped by an organization called Metal Cats. The police of Neo Tokyo tried in vain to rescue the singer: the kidnappers, utilizing a mysterious energy called ESP, were beyond their reach. The desperate police finally asked a young man named Akira to save Leyla - using his own ESP powers.\n\nCaroll uses a side-scrolling perspective for navigation, but it is not an action game, not even an action RPG; the core gameplay is that of a Japanese turn-based RPG. Enemies appear randomly, their portraits superimposed on whatever location Akira is currently in (effectively changing the perspective to first-person); a menu with battle commands pops up. Akira gathers money from battles (which can be spent in shops or hotels), as well as experience points needed to level up. Akira can execute various ESP techniques (such as healing); each time a technique is cast, an amount of his ESP points is depleted.","Publisher":"New System House Oh!","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"197603":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"UCom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"afc6e208-a450-4449-87dc-4a920ec9b823.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"11520f4c-9aed-4685-872c-425b21803b24.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e039a23f-c8cc-434a-97f2-08ae6246ddd5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"64687803-e8f9-41b8-8667-342e7aaa9e16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cherry Moderate","Publisher":"UCom","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197607":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wendy Magazine","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b8744b5c-b5d9-49af-a1d7-37d4ff1c9dcc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3eb4e6ee-fd41-4a45-ab0d-6bad1efb4080.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d89fb2cb-09ac-4f14-b040-2dff9341c25c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"58985bad-01bd-4fd4-bf96-5afc678f168d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Chikudenya Toubee: Hiroku Chigyaku no Yakata","Publisher":"Wendy Magazine","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197608":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"JAST","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"7eb0163d-3ff4-4e78-b44e-ea76e56aa0d2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a24f2d06-444c-4264-bd1e-91a2233e2744.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"321bd5e5-9650-474f-bd11-23702617f5b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cosmos Club","Overview":"Main character is a freshman student who gets to enter a student dormitory \"Cosmos club\" full of girls.

Soon he realizes that powerful figures from a corporation that Kimiko's family is part of are not about to give up, and his life is in danger as well...\n\nJonason is a Japanese-style adventure, without puzzles and with menu-based interaction. The interface is point-and-click, meaning that instead of the more typical omnipresent fixed menu commands the player first clicks on an object and then chooses one of the possible actions. There are a few timed sequences, which require the player to perform the necessary actions before the time runs out and the game is lost. The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.","Publisher":"Xyz","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197737":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PIL","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"781d179a-e6d9-477f-9424-5c24e8dda1ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"21628bb4-d8eb-43fd-9463-6091d94e5de3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jorou Gumo: Jubaku no Mesu Dorei-tachi","Publisher":"PIL","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197738":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KSS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8dae2bd5-901b-44ac-9b00-d70fb771fa7d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c163937c-1943-4e87-bdf8-5a7f88c8f36f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed4df2f1-16e3-4903-90f2-f9703d9771ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"30d62866-60be-4fc2-a5da-67702b61d3c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6bb34c1e-b919-4860-999e-5208132e7d6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cfdac06a-475a-4746-a810-8dfdd7fe51d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Joshikou Seifuku Monogatari","Publisher":"KSS","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197739":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Moonchild","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"aeb99580-2852-4a8d-a2c4-639cb32d1b3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bc494193-802d-4ff9-85f6-0924ed212fad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kairaku no Okite: Aoi Taiken","Publisher":"Moonchild","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197740":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Illusion","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9480fff8-dcf0-4b89-8e1e-5d2880e1b0a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5ad562ee-2a4f-49bf-80c6-caf09a65d9d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0b15583a-39ed-484d-90d2-b9306e0002db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kankin","Overview":"The year is 2197.

But all goes wrong in the very beginning, and the young women fall victims to vicious criminals.\n\nKankin has none of the classic (since Mokkoriman RPG) Illusion gameplay elements, and is low on interactivity even compared to other Japanese adventures. The player's input is reduced to choosing available menu options. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to Game Over, but most of the time the player has to go through all the options several times to make the story advance. There is no character movement whatsoever in the game, and the characters from whose point of view the story is told change with each scene, and include other minor characters beside the three main heroines.\n\n\"Kankin\" shares its dark futuristic setting and several characters (such as Kikuno and others) with other Illusion games, in particular its follow-up Requiem Hurts: Kankin.","Publisher":"Illusion","ReleaseDate":"1995-05-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197741":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Sensual Training"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tetratech","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5a85cac7-5f82-4637-87ce-9bed838caa29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kannou Kyoushuu","Publisher":"Tetratech","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197742":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"XYZ","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"52f286a3-07bc-4a2c-9079-dc4d59a48706.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4977a3fe-a049-4626-bb65-f5b2cb409f0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"200b9955-da4b-4022-9778-be0728e0d8ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kinbaku no Yakata","Publisher":"Xyz","ReleaseDate":"1995-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197743":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Studio Angel","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3aa19982-1072-44b2-bd84-e061fb2281e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5e4c58e4-fdc2-4b65-81dc-c25b61a3a89b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d323d4c7-ff8c-46b0-8e81-e522629a627b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kindan no Paradise","Publisher":"Zenryuutsuu","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"197744":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Succubus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"59c045cc-2a40-4a0f-9648-89e318c8fcfb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b44dfc8-d807-4a54-b13d-cfd4465db618.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d3d34a66-d63a-4ba2-aee4-23064ad8e02e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kinki Taboo","Publisher":"Succubus","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197745":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Onigashirajima Joshi Keimusho"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Illusion","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9522071b-04eb-4f08-b403-8f6895eb9506.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kitoushima Joshi Keimusho","Overview":"On a secluded island known as Onigashira stands a prison for women.

Short adventure segments feature traditional menu-based interface; typically, the player has to exhaust all options before the next event is triggered. Confrontations against female criminals take the shape of turn-based battles. The player is dealt a deck of cards representing normal attacks, special attacks, healing, as well as buffing up attack power and defense. In addition, each card has a number from 1 to 9; the higher this number is, the stronger is the effect of the card. Battles end with interactive, menu-based lesbian sex scenes.","Publisher":"Peppermint Kids","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197777":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Illusion","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"5aeaed36-6aba-4561-9087-0cf306f4f9a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"cb84261f-21af-4bec-9af2-fcd90beae3b3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef6ab27a-ee25-4e50-bb21-10a10f9156af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"29d12536-421e-4a31-ad8c-88fed7ca7b71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04681314-595d-425b-8531-e18dbd2f18c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Moeru Asoko no Paipai Yuugi: Fukkatsu!

The second scenario is set in medieval fantasy environment and focuses on two warrior sisters who got captured and thrown into a dungeon by monsters. Finally, the third scenario is dedicated to \"sex fighting\" between young women of various cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe gameplay is the same in all the scenarios, approaching the visual novel format, though with more choices than it is usually the case with comparable games. Rather than branching the storyline the choices serve simply to trigger new options and subsequently cutscenes, though some may lead to a premature end of the game.\n\nThe game largely consists of explicit sex scenes. A comic book-like behind-the-stage segment, extended introductions to other products by the same developer, and various art galleries are included.","Publisher":"Ponytail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-02-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197808":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Studio Milk","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"0bee31b1-7b78-4d9c-8242-5aa387442b7e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box -

Each player is dealt seven cards, and the objective is to be the first who discards all in hand. You do so by matching cards either by colour or number with the card shown in the discard pile (and thus the card thrown is the next to be matched). There are also cards with special “powers” that skip other players, change direction or force other players to draw additional cards, adding a somewhat strategical element. In the game you play against other four players (anime girls), and when winning you are presented with an interactive hentai scene. Each game consists of three rounds, the winner being the one who has more points (as the winner gets points based in the cards that opponents have in hand).","Publisher":"Tenshindo","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197819":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Software House Aladdin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Quiz","Images":[{"FileName":"87d79f99-d0bf-4c55-9c57-ca1dd120e161.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box -

When the protagonist, a substitute teacher, arrives at St. Sophia for a three months teaching job, he quickly discovers that the behavior of the school inhabitants is anything but compatible with the Christian morals...\n\nTenshitachi no Gogo 4, like most other games in the series, is a fresh start story-wise; from gameplay point of view, it plays just like its predecessors: it is a traditional Japanese adventure, without puzzles and with menu-based interactions, with verb commands and sub-menus of objects. Usually the game allows the player to advance only upon depletion of all the possible commands. There are, however, right and wrong decisions, including story branches that will end in a Game Over.","Publisher":"Jast","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197877":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"JAST","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f4119a43-7ff8-4877-9ea6-78d3609b2d29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fb74c88b-ef4e-4c29-aceb-6a98eafa414b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dc314d45-d85d-4d32-824d-793fb1142630.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tenshi-tachi no Gogo V: Nerawareta Tenshi","Publisher":"Jast","ReleaseDate":"1993-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197878":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"JAST","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6e6b584d-b970-473c-8b6a-aad20715a8f3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e08fa6e-b57b-4584-9308-78e598f02138.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1764c2d6-e13a-403a-ad88-a738765bc612.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0a6e1e4a-f952-43d8-9f79-92a58742c18a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tenshi-tachi no Gogo VI: My Fair Teacher","Publisher":"Jast","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197879":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"JAST","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Life Simulation; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"d5d93171-2ebc-4c82-854e-17cde9d51f4c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29d6b22e-eeab-41ab-944e-63e0b4492391.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"bee0f777-0603-4b38-9084-4644a3075435.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6629ab40-ae61-4c3b-97ca-20bce9412104.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"691fea2e-af78-4c2e-9fac-e408482075f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tenshi-tachi no Hohoemi","Publisher":"Jast","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197880":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"maboroshi ware","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"72472c8f-c491-4ef3-a672-9179fa31c21d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Time Slip Toujankyou: Joshikousei no Nazo","Publisher":"Maboroshi Ware","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197881":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Palm Tree Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5bc0e605-84e0-4e74-8de7-0c2d53bede55.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a41007c-c264-4a8d-8037-09009ca6404c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aede035f-1c28-4141-a08e-cbbc5c830ee7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"To Five","Publisher":"Palm Tree Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197882":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Poison Breath","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6928926b-1820-4349-8b42-d48540df3f4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7f5d7dda-25e8-44d6-9fa6-f687abc13f45.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Toge","Publisher":"Interheart","ReleaseDate":"1996-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197883":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Interheart","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1921ebd4-1971-4b75-8c56-9acfb5c9351b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1c4a8877-4618-4188-adb4-b681542231c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c4868a21-4047-47d2-aa41-86f226404601.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tokyo Fuuzoku Kikou","Publisher":"Interheart","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"197884":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Swat","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3c05e3b1-8ea3-43c5-b6f6-19e731a1565e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"95bc15b2-ce77-4a83-a23e-f109b787b3f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"84ca9ef3-eb33-43a8-a1ed-400126c7fb93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b5993394-8484-460c-b623-27334939ca90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9531ba6f-902d-49db-b05e-928e91fcd7ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tonight","Overview":"A monster \"No. 36\" landed in Tokyo and heads for America.

Do his feelings to his sister cross the line, becoming forbidden love?..\n\nThe gameplay in this installment follows the traditional Japanese adventure template typical for the series: at each screen, the player is presented with a large menu of verbs and objects.

Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to the one in Ribbon or in the previous Bangai-hen: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.","Publisher":"JAST Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"199380":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"JAST Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"be722ab3-bd62-412b-8ff7-735348137ce4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tenshi-tachi no Gogo Special II","Overview":"Main hero is high school student.

As in most other Tenshitachi no Gogo games, the story mainly depicts various encounters and conversations with female schoolmates and other girls Hayato meets in the city; the \"goal\" is to have sex with as many as possible.\n\nCompared to earlier Tenshitachi no Gogo games, Tenkōsei has simpler gameplay. The verb command menu has been drastically reduced; a typical screen contains only three or four basic commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Think\", \"Move\"), sometimes even less. There are also less objects in the sub-menus. The story advances in a more linear fashion.

The player takes the role of a condom salesman from Kawasaki. He has to gain access to seven apartments on the first floor of a residential building and sell his wares to the women living there.\n\nThe game mostly feels like a simulation with adventure-like elements. In the beginning the parameters of the player character are generated. These include his physical and psychological endurance, the amount of initial money, etc. The playing area is a small first-person pseudo-3D environment with vector graphics and colored character sprites. The protagonist is navigated with arrow keys and interacts with the environment when the player selects commands assigned to different letters. These include In, Out, Hello, Knock, Open, Take, Pay, Sell, and the ever useful Fuck.\n\nThis last action can be performed on different women depending on their disposition towards the player. Convincing women to buy condoms and\/or have sexual intercourse usually involves carefully and repeatedly combining various commands. Each command may have a negative influence on the player character's stats - for example, simply moving around reduces his physical stamina, and the game is over when it reaches zero. Should the protagonist succeed in his amorous conquest, a censored, but unequivocally implicit sexual scene is shown. There is, however, no explicit nudity in the game.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1983-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"199468":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Oranda Tsuma wa Denki Unagi no Yume o Miru ka?","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"0ab98a28-2149-460e-b9d0-cecc40108ede.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Do Dutchwives Dream of Electric Eel","Overview":"The title (translated as Do Dutchwives Dream of Electric Eel?, an obvious humorous allusion to Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) refers to a product of Japanese sex doll industry commonly known as \"dutchwives\". One of such sex dolls has been stolen, and the Oranda Corporation hires a private investigator to retrieve it.\n\nThe second entry in Koei's self-proclaimed \"Strawberry Porno\" series (following Danchi-zuma no Yūwaku) has certain similarities to its predecessor in interface and overall concept. However, it is a much more open-ended game with emphasis on gradual exploration and interaction, which gives it a definite role-playing flavor in addition to basic adventure-like gameplay.\n\nLike in the preceding game, the player character is generated by stopping rapidly revolving counters assigned to individual parameters. These parameters influence the chance of success in subsequent encounters with women, though much of it is calculated randomly. The player area is a fairly vast top-down urban environment consisting of numerous interconnected screens, which are mapped as the player explores them.\n\nThe streets are populated by various types of NPCs. These include young women who would sleep with the main character for money, yakuza thugs who would attack if provoked, policemen, etc. These characters are randomly generated. The map also includes various locations such as several love hotels, adult shops, fast food restaurants, phone booths and police stations. The protagonist can spend money on various items sold in these establishments, bring women to love hotels, or try his luck with hostesses. The ultimate goal of finding the missing sex doll can be achieved by acquiring a few key items and finding the right NPCs among many others.\n\nThe interaction on the streets consists of inputting the key-bound commands Look, Transact, Attack, Present, and Rape. The latter command can be used on certain types of women on the streets (provided there are no witnesses) and leads to the so-called \"Fuck Mode\", which can also be brought forth by having consensual sex with hookers or indoor female characters. This mode features a few sex-related commands.\n\nIn addition, indoor locations have their own set of commands bound to function keys. These include making a phone call, various types of conversation (nice, normal, aggressive, etc.), attacking, attempting to have sex, etc. Attacking usually leads to a separate first-person combat screen. Combat is turn-based and has its own set of commands (attack with weapon, attack with bare hands, etc.). There are no experience points awarded, but the protagonist's hit points decrease when the enemy manages to damage him.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1984-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"199469":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4fb358ea-b433-4395-9715-e94f2929d77b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Night life","Overview":"The first commercial Japanese erotic game, Night Life is a simple simulation of sexual intercourse, marketed as a tool aiming to help couples enjoy their sexual life more.
