(Night Commando!) is a combat flight simulator. The player controls a fighter plane on a night mission, and his task is to take off, destroy the target, avoid enemy attack and return to base.\n\nThe plane is controlled both with the joystick and the keyboard. With the joystick, the player controls the plane's direction (up, down, left or right) and weapon (with the action button). With the keyboard, he controls the several plane's instruments.\n\nThe game is seen from the plane's cockpit in a first person perspective. There's a main display, which will show (by player's request via keyboard) the plane's speed (M key), height (H), fuel (F), distance to target (T), distance to base (B), ammunition amount (W), weapon selected and friend/foe status. Above the main display, four lights can be seen, showing which weapon is selected: cannon (C), bomb (B), ground missile (G) and air missile (A). To the right, a direction and level indicator can be seen, and below it an infrared sensor.\n\nAfter taking off, the player must raise the landing gear (U) before the plane exceeds Mach 0.5 speed, or else the plane will be destroyed. Once in the air, after locating a target the player must identify (I) if it is a friendly or enemy aircraft. Shooting friendly airplanes or vehicles will terminate the mission.\n\nAfter destroying the targets, the player must land the plane. To do so, he needs to be at low speed, with the landing gear down and aligned to the ground. After touching the ground, the plane must hit the end of the runway as slow as possible. Failing to achieve these conditions will make the plane crash.\n\nThe plane will be also destroyed if it gets hit by an enemy, hits the ground, or runs out of fuel.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzC3kF0MUMA","Platform":"Magnavox Odyssey 2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Philips","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22830,"FileName":"a278b0ef-5e6f-4c72-ab91-1b1a4e0785ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":22830,"FileName":"29980df3-d4d8-449d-942f-3d0268eb409a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":22830,"FileName":"f394456c-6e9a-42c0-9978-a2d11de52cd7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":22830,"FileName":"9301464f-eb8a-4868-baf9-5da04c85f6c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22830,"FileName":"e4d06f89-d4c7-4aa0-88e1-28f4a6ad1558.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22830,"FileName":"7c1cdec7-0041-4d20-9ade-30de0bcfc4d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Brazil"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22830,"AlternateName":"Comando Noturno","Region":"Brazil"}]},{"DatabaseID":22831,"Name":"Computer Golf","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"COMPUTER GOLF!

Both games were early 1980s Brazilian prototypes called Missão Impossível and Viagem Programada that were subsequently re-packaged and officially released in 2006 by Humanoid Games.  \n\nMission Impossible is an action game. The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.\n\nProgrammed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Magnavox Odyssey 2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Ectron Eletrônica Ltda.","Publisher":"Humanoid Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22925,"FileName":"f349efa9-1c28-465c-b7e5-7b79011b8ec2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22925,"FileName":"67bb458e-3615-497e-b8c8-4dacc63f5e87.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22925,"FileName":"5b27a333-3a02-47e6-bc06-cc31754a8a12.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":22925,"FileName":"24e3c0fd-b491-4eee-8d90-db88a92c40bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22925,"FileName":"51ba161b-73dd-4ddd-b795-f4f3eba253c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22925,"AlternateName":"Missão Impossível / Viagem Programada","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":22925,"AlternateName":"Mission Impossible + Programmed Trip","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":22861,"Name":"Monkeyshines!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Monkeyshines! one or two players will try to tag as many monkeys as they can while avoiding being tagged back.

It is a math game where the objective is to make Nimble Numbers Ned jump over 100 numbered stones, avoiding his barrels of fun. To do so, the player has to run through one of the three minigames. At the start of the game, the computer will ask \"which drill?\" to what the player has to answer entering a number on the keyboard (1, 2, or 3). At the start of each drill, the computer will ask \"how good you are?\", to what the player has to answer with a number for the skill level (from 1 to 5). The games selected by the numbers are the following:\n\nName the Shapes: in this mini game the player has to identify correctly shapes on the screen. As one shape blinks on the screen, the computer will say \"this is a [name of the shape]\". The player has then to answer \"Y\" or \"N\". Each correct answer in the first try gives the player a chance to jump the barrels. The higher the skill level, the more chances the player get.\n\nMultiplication Runthrough: this is a multiplication game with one and two place operations. The computer asks \"what is XX x X?\" and the player has to answer entering the numbers on the answer from right to left. As in the previous game, each correct answer gives an extra chance of jumping, depending on the skill level.\n\nFunction Machine: in this game the player has to solve functions with unknown variables. The computer will ask questions such as \"if the number is X, what is the number plus Y?\", to which the player answers entering the numbers from right to left. Higher skill levels imply in more complex functions. As in the previous two games, correct answers grant the player extra chances to jump depending on the skill level.\nThere's also a jumping practice game, selected by pressing 0.
