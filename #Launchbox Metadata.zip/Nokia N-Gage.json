A double boost can be applied for high speeds, while a double tap to the right or the left makes the car drift. By ignoring all driving regulations, a wanted meter slowly builds up.

The opposite party also got several brawlers at hand. And by pressing a button you can summon your backing character to help you a little bit mid-fight. \n\nEvery character has their own martial style and set of special moves. There's also a \"max\" move, where one first needs to fill up a meter, scoring hits to use it, that's in turn lets you unleash a series of powerful attacks.

The game was going to be the first original mobile title in the Leisure Suit Larry series, but it was never finished, probably because of the failure of the Nokia console \/ phone.\n\nAs we can read in Wikipedia, in Leisure Suit Larry: Pocket Party, players would have been able to explore a college campus, while solving puzzles and engaging in risque activities. As they search for the ultimate good time (having sex), gamers bump into Rosie Palmer, the head cheerleader at Larry’s college and he is determined to do anything to be with her.\n\nIn addition to single-player gameplay, there were four different turn-based multiplayer mini-games. The game was supposed to be a big title for the N-Gage due to its raunchy language and humor, and also for the cell-shaded graphic, a brand new feature for the N-Gage.\n\nIt seems that Leisure Suit Larry N-Gage was developed twice: there are two completely full versions of the game. One that was deemed too raunchy and another that was redesigned by TKO-Dallas from the ground up.

Also you can take a look at some of the historical teams and games. But there are a few differences. \n\nThe first and most obvious one is graphics - the N-Gage game has a totally different graphical engine: instead of a fully 3D world, only the field is polygonal and sprites are used for the players models, thus making it more close to the sports games of the 90s. Secondly, Dynasty mode that lets you customize the team, build programs and recruit new members is absent, instead there are only quick play and season modes.

The story is about a tournament where fighters enter to come out on top and become \"the one\". At the start a custom fighter can be designed with options to alter the appearance through gender, face and skin colour, haircut, and outfit (top, bottom, footwear, gloves, accessories). Single-player games can be played in a Story, Survival, Training and Versus mode. The player can fight with only one type of character, but new moves are unlocked gradually by progressing through the Story mode, along with more customization options.\n\nThe fighting system with punches, kicks and combos is based on three stances (offensive, neutral and defensive) that can be switched on the fly. The poses determine the movement (quick, medium, slow), types of attack (quick and powerful combos, mixed strikes and some combos, and quick but weak strikes), defense (dodging, blocking and deflecting, and very easy blocking), and grip (one-hand grab for offensive and neutral, two-hand grab for defensive). The offensive pose is also the only one that allows for a counterattack after dodging.\n\nThe player's performance through the game is calculated through an ELO level that defines the progression. The Training mode is used to practice, in Survival the player has to defeat as many fighters as possible with one life and limited time, and Versus is one-on-one games against an AI opponent where it is possible to choose the opponent, make it a rated game or not, and define the rounds, time and enemy health. Opponents include bikers, boxers, clubbers, goths, kickboxers, punks, rappers, soldiers and more. Multiplayer against another player is supported through Bluetooth. The player's ELO score can be uploaded using the N-Gage Arena feature to compare rankings worldwide.","Publisher":"Nokia","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l8S31NH0EAU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/One_(N-Gage_game)"},"142878":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Torus Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2f393d9c-650a-472d-ba52-aaee6c413485.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0e1ae3aa-bff4-4463-ab65-7c7f56395125.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fb5c57c1-feb9-42d6-a2ea-0e1797b3c2b5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"21e70276-af80-4370-96e3-77016f8a296f.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d2a145d7-39b5-4985-bb85-608cf2770e4f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f599f8e9-1bde-46d6-b442-46527c1381f5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9945bc00-9fa5-41ed-a7b5-6d78fc50757a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"91495b8c-70e5-47cd-8e3b-154a04400e3d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Operation Shadow","Overview":"Operation Shadow is a third-person run-and-gun shooter set shortly after the Cold War. The player controls the commando Jay Solano, part of a covert Special Forces team of the United Nations, deployed to defuse situations where escalation can lead to global military conflicts.\n\nThe game starts in the fictitious Arawas region fighting Ixan forces and other regions are visited later on. Next to general Barton leading Team Shadow, other important characters are Maëlys Nyx, leader of the Midnight Wraiths mercenary outfit, General Neva, the political and military leader of the Rodan nation state, and CPN news network anchor woman Samantha Brown. There are four factions in total in the game: Ixan Desert Scorpions, Loxos Red Moon Army, Midnight Wraiths, and Rodan Snow Wolves. Next to moving on foot in the infantry mode, Solano can enter different types of crafts and vehicles during missions, such as a Humvee, a chopper, a hovercraft or a tank, each with very different controls and means. The Humvee can be used to take control over a mounted machine gun, the chopper uses a machine gun and missiles and the tank has both turrets and missiles.\n\nThe game is in 3D and the action is always shown from a third-person behind view. The linear levels have different objectives and a red marker on the compass near the top of the screen shows the general direction. Solano needs to move and strafe while shooting enemy forces while moving on foot. The assault rifle has an unlimited amount of ammo, while grenades and antitank missiles are used to take out larger targets. Vehicles and crafts need to be exited before the explode and there is a general health meter for Solano as well. Using the tank or the chopper it is possible to lock on and shoot missiles. Pick-ups include health, armour, grenades, double damage, invincibility and frenzy. There are also ammo pick-ups for the Gatling gun, bazooka, tank shells, multi-rocket launcher, chopper rockets and Hellfire missiles.\n\nThe singe-player mode is split up into different campaigns with multiple missions each, provided by general Barton. The game supports competitive multiplayer games on four maps through Bluetooth for up to four players.","Publisher":"Nokia","ReleaseDate":"2004-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mD2j4YQUBj4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Shadow"},"142880":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Toys for Bob","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"609acbf5-8936-44d1-a210-3e8d13de4da6.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"89d1ae66-0594-4878-adc9-d32575088bd5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"925f1ffe-afc7-41ed-98ba-76e0ad175a61.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"df5734e8-a2f1-4333-a8e5-c42ad01d7277.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9b946644-bc62-409f-82ab-11315f7bdeb8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"62d567ae-d5c2-483f-81bb-0a66a6f65484.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a118615-7b09-4738-879e-065c9cd014da.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d9a08857-e687-4c33-9139-a5e233422fe5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"297796c1-8733-4ecd-a0af-bc345efc2fee.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pandemonium!","Overview":"The young sorceress Nikki, the court jester Fargus, and his side-kick Sid the puppet are the three main protagonists of this 3D platform game.

In the story mode, series hero Bubblen (aka Bub in most US releases of the series) must recapture six stolen diamonds from bad guy Drunk and his minions. It consists of six consecutive one-on-one stages arranged on a map of Rainbow Island. Three difficulty settings are available, with a special ending only becoming available upon finishing the hardest level.\n\nGameplay follows the standard template of the series: at the start of a level, differently colored bubbles fill part of the play field. The players control a launcher at the bottom that can be aimed in any direction and shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field, with any unattached bubbles falling away. Removing bubbles adds them to the opponents' fields. After a while, more bubbles fill in from the top, pushing the existing bubbles downward. A player loses when the bubbles reach the bottom of their field. Special power-ups are available via a bubble gauge, which fills when removing a certain amount of bubbles at once. Once the gauge is full, the powers can be unleashed at the press of a button.","Publisher":"Nokia","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cQOrih2P_vQ"},"142898":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gameloft Divertissements","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"896421e1-3cf7-4847-bcc8-ae0594c559a8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1f2321f0-3359-41c7-a981-0f30ecca8737.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9b12b687-0728-475f-b9ba-41403cb8c49d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7521c8cc-61d3-4b24-8bea-1d42090f59af.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e37e1d1a-8cbb-47db-8a0f-ed8c127c312a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7afc4753-cbb4-43f3-8343-58ca665db42a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c5bed211-54f2-4ad4-bd1a-7f70516d168c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c48a00a3-eb87-468b-aec6-e172d3f1073b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ee6db397-6b29-478a-8f02-45f86c5da820.JPG","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ef1f338c-2f2a-4ff6-8887-d23f73855016.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Rayman 3","Overview":"Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world in peril.

The fairy accompanies the player during the journey, and can help him with an advice or slightly heal him if health gets very low. Hit points could also be restored with various food that lies around on the map.\n\nThere are also two multiplayer modes: one is for cooperative play, and another one that allows two characters to battle against each other.","Publisher":"Nokia","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y4tfehxNvdE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Requiem_of_Hell"},"142901":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Backbone Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"a259da76-5718-4606-b164-82cc9aeaf565.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a0140fc5-9164-4546-b390-7102b89abb70.png","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2f55e12d-9636-4451-b7b1-1260ecb0d677.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7e7bc30b-1713-4125-b058-fe4eee75ee26.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c0347e7f-0031-4222-9365-f2abc33f199f.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4cf4d493-2da4-4551-bd96-21f3f4ee7417.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0df67c88-085b-413e-afca-3f84312c5845.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f2ee6364-69c8-46f8-b46b-e567d45e585c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aeb354c6-e2ac-4e92-8290-816f118cb3ff.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1ecd5cb2-da42-4e41-ab05-e8ef6c279cbe.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"073a3b28-a498-48eb-bcca-329f21383b12.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ea1ac021-7e44-4467-848a-9f52208caadc.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e99a1fa9-dcee-4bad-bc69-4a7f05f3ef77.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8ac67597-a253-400e-b093-95cb70557400.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0fe9925f-c507-4186-86a0-6506bcc6bd22.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Rifts: Promise of Power","Overview":"This is a traditional RPG game with turn-based tactical combat based on the pen and paper role-playing system called Rifts. The system is quite eclectic and is somewhat similar to Shadowrun, though it also deals with post-apocalyptic, horror and western elements. Due to the massive nuclear war at the end of the XXI century and deaths of the millions and subsequent disasters result in a huge release of the magical energy that happens to activate a system of mythical ley lines. Usually hidden from the eyes of humanity, now they've become visible and powerful and created a number of \"rifts\" leading to parallel worlds and other dimensions. Many alien beings from different worlds got sucked in and transported to Earth, forcing them to co-exist with humans - from fantasy races to vampires, demons, mutants and many others. The story of the game starts several hundred years after the beginning of those events: you are a prisoner on the run from the group called Dead Boys, and first thing you have to do is remove the ugly tattoo from your face that marks you as someone's escaped property.\n\nThe game begins with a character creation - you can choose from the three proto classes, that later could be evolved into a more sophisticated and narrowed versions. The classes are mercenary - a specialist in technology, psychic that deals with power of the mind, and mage that feeds from the magic-filled world. The roleplaying system uses a set of primary stats like in DnD, Shadowrun or GURPS and a set of dependable skills spread into categories like technical, personal, military, magical and so on. \n\nThe game goes in real-time, but when a fight is bound to happen it goes into turn-based mode governed by action points and character's initiative. During the combat both skills and weapons of your party could be used, terrain also plays a role and various objects like propane tanks could be used as well.\n\nThe visual style is a mix of 3D maps and sprite characters, and as an uncommon feature you can rotate the view by the 90 degrees to get a better look at the surroundings. Rifts also boasts online functionality - there are several multiplayer modes such as King of the Hill and Capture the Flag that could be played both locally via Bluetooth or through N-Gage Arena service, which was closed after Nokia ceased supporting the platform.","Publisher":"Nokia","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eyLdG7tBLSI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rifts:_Promise_of_Power"},"142921":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tannhauser GAte","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"cadd9835-1f84-4b19-a5e1-fb247bed9869.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3954680b-d62d-4b95-afa7-f39d90ac1ed5.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e4548fc3-237e-47b7-8961-5fd79ed526fe.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d5fb649-25eb-4fd9-bea5-5e013d6cd462.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cb43769a-bdba-47f8-9427-bf0d6ce38758.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6edfe843-c04b-4af2-94db-f2ce1ae6d0fa.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9f8a8894-acde-4a24-9107-00a9ec752496.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"33510023-0a3a-454e-a0cb-06a17f649cae.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"The Roots: Gates of Chaos","Overview":"The Roots: Gates of Chaos is an action role playing game set in a fantasy world.

The tasks you can get are mostly kill or fetch quests typical for many ARPGs and MMORPGs that can provide you with valuable items in case you succeed and also do it before a deadline, as all of them are time-limited.\n\nThe role playing system consists of a set of primary stats, usable skills and passive talents specific for each of the five character classes. Skills could be equipped and used on the game map: there are things like empowered attacks as rain of arrows, or something more original when for limited amount of time you could transform into an a giant spider that will let you bruteforce your way around.\n\nThe visual style is somewhat cartoonish in appearance as in another Blizzard game - Warcraft III.Besides the single player mode, it's possible to play together with up to four player characters on the same in-game locations.

Each one of the four networks - European, Russian, South American and United States has their distinctive color schemes, musical tracks, track layouts and also different flyers. Vehicles has four different parameters: speed, drift, handling and aero. While, the first three are obvious, the last one is quite unique, as each one of the flyers can take off and glide for some time. It could be used to avoid obstacles, gather power-ups and take over your enemies.\n\nBeside the story mode, where the goal is to hack each of the four global networks, there are also more typical Grand Prix tournament, single races and a multiplayer game.","Publisher":"Nokia","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tkzdRKy9lXg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/System_Rush"},"142931":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Digital Eclipse Software","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"040d5019-876b-4511-acba-9e9ca875fbfd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0359f12c-e565-43d4-88bf-0c7bb6fcd83c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9502d55a-78a0-4925-a55c-00a3ee698b20.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ffcc66ea-9fde-49bb-9e2d-8b0169b37d0a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6fc20781-84b0-48ee-a8f4-67b6143cf8e8.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1b92ddef-a1d5-4fd9-9d67-0b8898aeec40.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6b0bda32-feb5-4d8e-8c8b-6c8f3ce772f3.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b388adfd-b5ea-44ca-8be9-f1d4e18ed984.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"968fb9ce-e999-49e7-9ad5-d583d2a9add0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d4b70e48-68db-4fda-b050-d71d35ba4802.JPG","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004","Overview":"While professional golfer Tiger Woods has no equal on the PGA Tour, you now have the chance to build a golfer that's even better.

This particular game offers storyline-type missions which can be played in either single player mode or co-operative multiplayer. It also offers competitive multiplayer game modes: deathmatch, survival and defend.\n\nStory: The year is 2010 and the situation in Bogota explodes. Explosions, gun fights and general mayhem trouble major Colombian cites as the ever-fragile cease-fire between guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries has just been broken. The driving force behind the violence has been identified as the MFLC (Movimiento de las Fuerzas Libres Colombianas), a paramilitary group funded by drug cartels. Washington, in collaboration with the Cuban and Colombian governments who are clearly overwhelmed by the current events, has chosen to put a end to the MFLC once and for all.

Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.","Publisher":"Eidos","ReleaseDate":"2003-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zr7wYeAksaQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tomb_Raider_(1996_video_game)"},"142936":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Neversoft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"11af8dcc-842b-4b11-ae42-9e52c40b2e64.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"336175f6-1d29-4431-8a65-e9b5cb899349.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"906b6f28-6c78-4b9b-bd1f-f0306aa46ebd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"276a1d21-8592-47d7-a075-bc43b66fae25.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"34cab59b-9e70-4c93-af30-c0635f1004eb.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"370a5fef-6082-4b18-874e-d3e78f4ee014.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d6673888-3a96-457c-a678-04a9c7a4eb33.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0c1863e5-1fb3-4716-9c6a-f88250b68121.JPG","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"62b90059-f0f1-40f7-953b-5e998cfba8d4.JPG","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7eb24e2f-ed7d-4c0b-b27f-a778b8a58a5c.JPG","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater","Overview":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a skateboarding simulation in which you control a famous skate star around 3D environments.

Warhammer 40,000: Glory in Death, unlike many licensed WH titles, is an attempt to bring that type of tabletop gameplay into the digital realm, in that case to N-Gage.\n\nThere are four different factions to play with: Space Marines, Orcs, Eldar (think High Elves) and Chaos Space Marines, plus four sub-factions for each of them. All parties has their set of infantry and armor units (more than 60) with different roles, stats and attacking powers, that could be upgraded. There are campaigns with a storyline told through comicbook-like cutscenes for each of them as well. And a skirmish mode that lets you tune what type of a mission you'd like to play, select the map size, AI-mastery level, type of an environment and such. And there's multiplayer mode as well, that could be played either one a single device on turn-by-turn basis, or via Bluetooth with other N-Gage devices.\n\nThe game plays pretty much as a typical turn-based tactics\/strategy, however with specific Warhammer 40k rules applied. For example moving phase and shooting phase are separated, as well as an assault phase that lets you send your troops into hand-to-hand fight, that will keep the enemy squads busy. Commanders can be assigned to lead squads, some units can infiltrate enemy positions and etc. The battlefield is separated into several equal sector and the goal is usually to keep it under your control as attacking or defending side by the end of turn limit. Another important difference is that you can choose to deploy some units into battlefield at separate turns to reinforce the you forces where it's needed.","Publisher":"THQ Wireless","ReleaseDate":"2006-04-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=smzoxku4Ijo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Warhammer_40,000:_Glory_in_Death"},"142941":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team17 Software","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"ade063c3-ab87-429a-ad7b-89a316d83bb6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cdbd348a-177e-499f-b60f-c98b30c3309c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bc435c00-9053-4dc0-b67f-0213cb622148.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0eb77e09-bb04-4d6c-a1c6-87ec177ac554.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"833a2707-432f-494d-ab9b-9a477b9f1e83.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9b53d62a-16dc-49c5-b469-96837b1789df.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5cd2151f-2b63-4696-a1fb-8af366baaf90.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Worms: World Party","Overview":"The Worms are back, deadlier than ever.

There are a multitude of moves starting with simple kicks and punches to more sophisticated grapples, throws and counter strikes. Weapons could also be picked up used sometimes. And unique to each fighter there are Smackdown moves, which when performed are shown in a cinematic manner. To activate them player needs to fill up a gauge by smacking his opponent for some time.\n\nOther elements that were licensed are the introduction walks and musical themes, which are unique for each of the wrestlers.

Some characters could be unlocked at later stages.\n\nThe game story starts with a discovery of new young mutant, Alison, who has a powerful ability - a control over the Earth's magma layer. And human-hating Brotherhood of Mutants is quick to try to capture her to enlist into their numbers. X-Men manage to fight them off only to discover it was also just a part of their plot - to free their leader, an evil mastermind called Magneto from his long-term imprisonment.\n\nThe game plays as many traditional ARPGs with an emphasis on direct control and action. Every mutant has four primary battle skills that command their unique abilities plus some that are shared among all of them. It could be anything from Cyclops' optic beam, Gambits' deck of cards or Storms' massive tornado attack.\n\nThe N-Gage release shares many similarities to a PC and console game from Raven Software, however the graphic engine and in-game perspective are totally different - instead of fully 3D, almost top-down view, Barking Lizards version has a traditional isometric view with a prerendered world. There are 24 missions in a whole and the game features voice-overs and has some FMV cutscenes from the \"bigger\" edition.

When Earth fought back, the alien motherships picked our air forces out of the sky effortlessly. On the ground, the world’s armies scored puny – but inspiring – victories.
