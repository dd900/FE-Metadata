The game, however, does just the opposite: it puts the player in control of a man who must pursue a fleeing young girl and rape her.\n\nThe game has two gameplay modes. The first is a side-scrolling arcade sequence during which the player has to prevent the girl from reaching her house, and avoid the hazards on the protagonist's way. These include stones, barriers, animals such as dogs and turtles, etc., and can be avoided by destroying or jumping over them. The protagonist runs automatically, but the player can increase or decrease the distance between him and the running girl. In order to make the girl choose the wrong way and fail to find her house, the protagonist throws stones at her (these can also be used to kill animals and destroy obstacles).\n\nAfter the protagonist has caught the girl, the game switches into sex simulation. The player pushes arrow keys in a specific order to correspond with the protagonist's movements. The goal is to sexually satisfy the girl. If the player fails, the protagonist is arrested; if he succeeds, the girl marries the protagonist.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Macadamia Soft","Publisher":"Macadamia Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195331,"FileName":"67614cef-855d-426a-b878-6b443632699a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":195331,"FileName":"31c49937-e584-43c4-a877-a3055c32c4f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195331,"FileName":"16dd6472-cbec-48d9-a60a-97db9b825790.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186837,"Name":"1942","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"1942 is a vertically scrolling shooter for one or two players.

But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.).

The goal of the Bomberman is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182376,"FileName":"2bdaee60-4072-48f3-b51c-544e9c666386.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":182376,"FileName":"a441df15-529f-4a2c-86f9-1fbb76c45c35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182376,"FileName":"9338ff67-6e21-4209-8207-90f287bdd75d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182376,"AlternateName":"Bakudan Otoko","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":186846,"Name":"Bosconian","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Bosconian is a space shooter.

The three goddesses there have been captured, the twelve signs of the zodiac dispersed, and the creatures enslaved. Perseus has been summoned by Zeus to right this wrong, and has been given a magic sword and shield with which to do it...\n\nCourageous Perseus is an action RPG, where the aim is to fight monsters and find either the 12 zodiac symbols or the three missing goddesses. Perseus starts the game on a raft off the coast of the island, which is crawling with monsters which randomly move about. These can be fought by running into them while holding down the fight button. Due to inexperience, only the light blue soldiers may be killed at the start of the game. But each won battle improves Perseus's offensive and defensive statistics, allowing Centaurs, Cockatrices, a Dragon and the gorgon herself to be eventually overcome.\n\nWinning a battle also restores a small amount of Perseus's energy. Energy is decreased though by being hit by enemies and also slowly decreases with time. Perseus starts with 1000 energy, which can be supplemented by finding energy sources scattered around the island. Once the energy reaches zero, the game is over. The game can also be lost if Perseus's raft is capsized by one of the giant crabs that infest the surrounding seas.

The protagonist is navigated with arrow keys and interacts with the environment when the player selects commands assigned to different letters. These include In, Out, Hello, Knock, Open, Take, Pay, Sell, and the ever useful Fuck.\n\nThis last action can be performed on different women depending on their disposition towards the player. Convincing women to buy condoms and/or have sexual intercourse usually involves carefully and repeatedly combining various commands. Each command may have a negative influence on the player character's stats - for example, simply moving around reduces his physical stamina, and the game is over when it reaches zero.

The player controls the army of the Land of Light, and has to repel the evil overlord Böser and his monsters. The player must build their army by spending points/cash earned in the previous battle to acquire new units before the next. In order to maximize the player's chances of victory, they have to defeat as many enemy units as possible without letting them escape while securing their own units' safety to have the most spending money for the following conflict. Points are awarded based on the strength of the defeated enemy, but points are lost if members of your army are defeated. Turns do not necessarily alternate between the player and the computer. Rather, the side which begins a new round is determined by a coin toss. It was originally released in 1987 for the NEC PC-8801 computer. The game also has a Construction Mode that allows the player to create their own scenarios with units not found in the main game.

The story of the game, however, is based on pure mythology, featuring Buddhist deities in their distinctly Japanese incarnations. The protagonist is contacted by the bodhisattva Akasagarbha (known as Kokūzō in Japan, from the Chinese Xukongzang), who tells him that the world is in danger: the king of demons is trying to locate and neutralize the holy Ashes of Buddha, whose power protects the eight worlds. The hero's task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.\n\nOne of Enix's works that were unreleased outside of Japan, Gandhara is an action RPG with rather simple gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through hostile top-down areas, fighting constantly respawning enemies with sword or magical spells. Rations must be bought in order to keep the hero alive. Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Enix Corporation","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187868,"FileName":"4654ab3a-a4e6-4d95-910b-aa744f79b363.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187868,"FileName":"569fda05-2881-4be3-b728-9447a7d31dad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187868,"FileName":"b4a2c5cf-5215-47e3-a525-9633793ded69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180785,"Name":"Gate of Labyrinth","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Gate of Labyrinth is a role-playing game where the player leads a party of adventurers in first-person perspective in a grid-based environment.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Dempa Shinbunsha","Publisher":"YMCAT","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180785,"FileName":"0c5429ea-6d34-400c-a774-2b6dbc826582.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180785,"FileName":"97f149f4-d951-49c3-b361-b84bd3b5b486.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180785,"FileName":"044a5da5-fc0e-44ed-9d03-b2b903d7358c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193310,"Name":"Gegege no Kitarou","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/zEE-4k7DxJY","Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Bandai","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193310,"FileName":"0050c70f-facf-480f-8a56-116b3a2daa71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193310,"FileName":"06f42b71-226d-4d3d-a106-c25fbc3b7fca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193311,"Name":"Golf Island Special","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/D8_VATp5sPQ","Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Tecno Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193311,"FileName":"634d623a-6156-4ff6-bac6-ff245c8d9a58.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193311,"FileName":"beb127c0-1c40-4845-b6b0-b1427d25cecc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193311,"FileName":"12993c75-6d6a-4ec1-b82a-6ab6e6c87f2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193311,"FileName":"f5fb14c9-cdf8-4116-8007-03329d4e6cf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193311,"FileName":"068d9401-6980-4025-b85f-75e0ada9e8c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187870,"Name":"Gradius","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"The people of Gradius are in trouble.

Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes.\n\nAnother now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.\n\nThe opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.\n\nThe game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187873,"FileName":"c45c6af6-bb18-4641-b25d-fa31e42f5520.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187873,"FileName":"fbc0cbc1-f695-4284-b793-db37f4834250.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187873,"FileName":"860736ed-66fd-44b9-91b6-dbeda6e459ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187874,"Name":"Hokuto no Ken","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Hokuto no Ken is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star.

The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to \"bump\" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies.

But one dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of the depths of Hydlide. The next morning, strange doors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, but were never seen again. From that day on, unusual events and disasters began to take place. Huge cracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands, floods wiped out entire villages. And then the monsters came. The Hydlide council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A wise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young man who could save Hydlide from the grave danger. This young man is you...\n\nHydlide 3  is the third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply \"bumping\" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft, Inc.","Publisher":"T&E Soft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187878,"FileName":"3b5bdab3-8390-44b6-babb-407f3cb1afd1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187878,"FileName":"208b2fd5-c405-4cc7-9ba2-7ecdc0ac06c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187878,"FileName":"51abd1fd-e830-4390-8d0f-e03f01cfbb7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187878,"FileName":"71e3782f-bd27-4890-851c-54c560e3ee82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187877,"Name":"Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Hydlide II is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series.\n\nIn a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended.

We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"BrainGrey","Publisher":"BrainGrey","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187883,"FileName":"24c0d07c-5f36-4d73-8c1a-87171cf8b540.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187883,"FileName":"d8cdeee0-5e2c-4299-8b98-2a4e24e5d9c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187883,"FileName":"f2dfb17a-2337-47e8-9b69-b81d8521f1fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187883,"FileName":"98e56ef8-375a-4a15-b077-cb07faf04b87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193325,"Name":"Last War","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Leven Pro","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193325,"FileName":"8c1a4774-e8fc-41f1-94f0-b896dd0b7c50.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193325,"FileName":"3dadf161-c872-4b44-9f6c-39e544f39d8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193325,"FileName":"8946e0ea-ee3f-40f9-9a2d-480152503ab1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193325,"FileName":"51adc76b-adf9-4e1d-8748-5f1a4a47f3f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193325,"FileName":"21cd56d8-6cc0-4c3c-9304-f3f18863038e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187884,"Name":"Lizard","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Lizard is a simple first-person dungeon crawler in Wizardry style, though with a single player character rather than a party.

Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.\n\nThe Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the game environment consists of maze-like passages made with pseudo-3D graphics.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player creates a party of six adventurers. There are six classes to choose from: knight, robber, sorcerer, cleric, paladin, and archer. Each character has six main attributes: might, endurance, accuracy, personality, intelligence, and luck, with each class requires proficiency in a specific attribute for effective functioning. There are also five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\n\nAs in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The party starts in a particularly weak state, equipped with only clubs and having no money. The player is free to explore most of the game's locations in any order, and there are few hints as to what needs to be done to advance the plot. Turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies typically take place against a group of monsters more or less equal in size to the player-controlled party, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain. It is also possible to try and bribe enemies or surrender to them before entering combat.\n\nThe game has no auto-mapping feature of any kind and it is only possible to save the player's progress at inns located in towns.\n\nThe TurboGrafx CD version of this game has significant differences.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196706,"FileName":"4c00da02-8d37-4afd-8840-3085eeb3595f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196706,"FileName":"dc6d9ce0-6c14-4f81-9520-bd2c09650638.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":196706,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic: Book One - Secret of the Inner Sanctum","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190184,"Name":"Milky Way","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/X3pa5jCO46Y","Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Micronet","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190184,"FileName":"ceaa4aaf-341b-467e-a6fc-26507341a461.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190184,"FileName":"46069482-6be9-4a93-a4ef-cc1faaaa1e2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190184,"FileName":"0c10ed28-d1a1-4a67-9153-b7b4037f74da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190184,"FileName":"929be498-b679-499e-b295-ab266f4653cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190184,"FileName":"adda7de3-e91a-4d5c-89c4-36e85fd36f78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193335,"Name":"Mimitan","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/A6HC0sYY7Ww","Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193335,"FileName":"57daefd9-833b-45ed-9d47-c93327be92c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193339,"Name":"Minami Taiheiyou Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Featuring clear and beautiful graphics and a well thought-out system, this short game is considered to be one of hardest to solve.\n\nThere are over 30 items to use, but their usage is sometimes illogical.

Another change is elimination of random enemy encounters in favor of enemies visibly roaming the overworld. Characters can now join the protagonist and participate in battles.

Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite \"Raiden\". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, \"Racoon\", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship \"Septemius 2\", was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.\n\nPsy-O-Blade is a Japanese adventure in anime style.

The ball must be picked back up after being thrown.\n\nEvery few stages, there is a bonus coin round with no enemies. Most stages also feature a POW block in the center, which can be hit a limited number of times to flip every enemy on the screen. There is also a small pit in the center of the screen at the bottom, into which Mario can fall if he isn't careful.

The young prince must assemble a capable army and lead it to the enemy's stronghold.\n\nThe game marks the first implementation of Kure Software Koubou's trademark \"gocha-kyara\" (\"mixed-up characters\") system. Essentially it is a hybrid of a role-playing and a real-time strategy game. Initially the player controls only Lancelot himself, but soon thereafter he becomes the leader of the first team, and eventually the player is put in control of several teams containing a dozen or more soldiers each. It is possible to switch between teams at almost any time and explore different areas.\n\nThe player physically controls only the team leader, navigating him or her through interconnected overhead areas. Battles flow in real time and are automatized for everyone except the leader, which must be controlled manually. In order to prevail, however, it is necessary to assemble and outfit teams properly, judging the nature of upcoming battles in advance. Each team member has his or her own statistics and grows up in levels as they vanquish enemies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Kure Software Koubou","Publisher":"Kure Software Koubou","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187915,"FileName":"56ef5ea3-b4e3-426b-b79f-fe329fec2d90.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187915,"FileName":"e82b8738-bd95-4206-aa08-063b48d59134.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187915,"FileName":"0f5f60a6-a367-4daa-b32d-e7a39167037b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187915,"FileName":"e51101ea-ed37-45dd-9224-97ade6cd5426.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187916,"Name":"Sofia","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"A girl named Sofia touches a magical crystal and gets teleported to a parallel world, now she has to find the crystal so that she can return to her world.\n\nSofia is a non-scrolling 2D platformer: when Sofia reaches the end of the screen, she emerges on the left side of the next screen.

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187918,"FileName":"67311a01-2321-4159-be71-a74228b9ea5d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187918,"FileName":"68c9baae-d3ff-4728-beec-bd001380e36c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187918,"FileName":"b46e9f74-0a87-4f9e-b09a-05ddbc0956dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187918,"FileName":"081409cc-457c-41cc-a4dd-452917b1edc2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187918,"FileName":"8fb59095-6609-4bea-a798-8225318928f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193348,"Name":"Space Cruiser","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Carry Lab","Publisher":"Nidecom Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193348,"FileName":"a46963ce-cc60-49a5-82a8-1b9e79ab3249.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193348,"FileName":"15d6af24-d802-4c4e-a945-a2496f090510.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193348,"FileName":"99224da6-7340-4676-a3e7-baefa4bb9dca.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193348,"FileName":"8997f97c-ef75-4863-8540-89c34d4b4c25.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193348,"FileName":"d1cf2615-4f1b-4b06-8929-85528ef42350.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190199,"Name":"Space Hamburger","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/UQ8TkL9S5_I","Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190199,"FileName":"f710e04e-0d01-43ce-b741-8bcae060e631.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190199,"FileName":"e7bdd588-cf9d-4c63-a8b0-f2ce0c1099e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187919,"Name":"Space Harrier","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens.

Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, you proceed to the next level.\n\nBut the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the \"piggy bank\". You must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank. Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over.\n\nBetween levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you have the ability to access these intermissions. As you proceed through the levels, the game gets quite difficult.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Soft Pro International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187921,"FileName":"97a24ab2-4e81-4dde-9602-93d2816d04e7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187921,"FileName":"184f3a04-0172-48f2-84fb-fc7546ed08d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187921,"FileName":"f7126f74-d2a7-4c3b-a306-58aba3618c76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187921,"FileName":"67df5ac1-da52-4904-b881-b374c23812f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193350,"Name":"Star Arthur Densetsu I: Wakusei Mephius","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"An early sci-fi Japanese adventure game developed by T&E Soft in 1983 about the adventures of Star Arthur on his quest to obtain the legendary energy sword and stop the Jyamil empire from terrorizing the galaxy.

The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187931,"FileName":"966b4cf9-6311-4e4d-9456-a8ff5febf752.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187931,"FileName":"19a29d34-a576-4ca9-a2a7-ee5185be0ab5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187931,"FileName":"dda5fd66-4cbb-4032-8f5c-e988f82c7892.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187931,"FileName":"f3fe20a7-5f93-46f6-9034-8d27e01ad3a3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187931,"FileName":"0697c30c-556e-4f77-9689-e250e09e1e3e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187930,"Name":"Urusei Yatsura: Koi no Survival Birthday","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The scenario in the game is the same as in the anime.

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187939,"FileName":"d3cc9ee7-b882-4c56-b759-3061f43fce13.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187939,"FileName":"01928b28-ed65-4ef5-bc68-988d1002579d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187939,"FileName":"7ac33a02-535c-45ec-a391-c095b2017f73.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187939,"FileName":"4e7791df-7c71-4162-b124-1ed3e0eab874.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187939,"FileName":"950fe54a-cca0-4899-9785-f5d7edf3232c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193360,"Name":"Woody Poco","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Woody Poco is an Action game, developed and published by DB Soft, which was released in Japan in 1986.

The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \"karma\" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many \"good\" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X1","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"c45057bf-6396-4cca-a417-e075fbf35ce2.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"c32dd907-47f1-4ffa-b6d2-016acaa999a9.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"4d7f2c14-f86d-4d59-b5ab-1029ddf1653a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"e7a1feac-5c50-4705-81a8-b34a6a2405f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"99533053-5485-4834-8d8a-88056f49797c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"e99406f7-66ab-4c7f-bd41-035bc6244443.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187940,"FileName":"c1deb466-478f-4ccd-980f-1e5a8c8ffe3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187941,"Name":"Xanadu: Scenario II","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Xanadu: Scenario 2 is an expansion pack to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II.

Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns.
