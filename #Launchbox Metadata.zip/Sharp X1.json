The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others.

However, when the robot enters a building, the game transforms into one of the earlier examples of a 3D, third-person perspective shooter. The levels culminate in boss battles, which take place on separate top-down areas.\n\nThe player is given a considerable freedom as to which locations to visit first. Collecting power units increases the robot's power. If a particular boss encounter proves to be too difficult, the player can explore other areas, level up, and return to the boss stronger than before, giving the game an RPG angle.","Publisher":"Arsys Software, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"186965":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Limited","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9a273aae-ce63-4d9a-885d-c5110fe499e4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d5e1e440-93f2-4cae-ac1e-f68340e05b9c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d2125412-75f6-4441-922b-cf80e9cab3e3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"73e38988-e01e-4690-a4e5-ded30a126d90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c46ef133-7fdf-476c-90ff-090bf772f111.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mappy","Overview":"You control Mappy, a police-mouse whose job is to collect valuables (consumer electronics) from a cat's house.

Magic spells deplete Adol's magic points bar.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ys_II:_Ancient_Ys_Vanished_%E2%80%93_The_Final_Chapter"},"187863":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"bba96b2a-e535-4be0-a998-b3461a381309.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f3d8e348-e0f4-4a8b-b792-fc28856ce4a5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a7bda12-2768-44b5-9675-7d6e70834dae.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"852efbd9-ca1e-44a0-9c19-82bad201380d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"02271679-444b-4392-a182-5d0a68552afa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0fdb4ac0-bd33-493c-8522-1e9721e28537.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Fire Crystal","Overview":"After having recovered the legendary Black Onyx in your previous adventure, your party of heroes took the portal in Utsuro town to a new world, where they begin the search for the powerful Fire Crystal.

Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes.\n\nAnother now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.\n\nThe opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.\n\nThe game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.","Publisher":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"187874":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Enix Corporation","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6c6979a7-5ab6-4334-9fe0-7c360c31c715.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"003014e3-31bf-4b57-ae5a-064ce1315e50.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4cc25f2-1df9-41a5-85ad-16fa1d5b57ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1f54762a-9565-402d-a8c0-087ccfcb31b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"98c3158e-f5ac-4cb6-b5ad-dae63566ca2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d94ff95a-e3d9-4b5e-bb69-500a01a6f2dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1d4af9b8-ddc6-4ace-bc04-a7c98a747cf1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3d9acc11-bdc6-4877-8911-1eb11991dbd3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hokuto no Ken","Overview":"Hokuto no Ken is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star.

We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills.

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"187919":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"AM R&D Dept. #2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"197694d2-650e-4e18-8a4e-a3da42ea0242.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2f69079a-2656-4af9-afbb-bed49b21c89c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5edb34f1-85d9-4e2a-9df6-23ad4741e9eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"93f90ed9-fcac-4dbe-9d73-47b0eddb02e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"55d5cb70-d0ab-4fed-b2b6-2ea2fbe55d91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Space Harrier","Overview":"Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens.

Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle.

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"187940":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"c45057bf-6396-4cca-a417-e075fbf35ce2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"c32dd907-47f1-4ffa-b6d2-016acaa999a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"4d7f2c14-f86d-4d59-b5ab-1029ddf1653a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7a1feac-5c50-4705-81a8-b34a6a2405f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c1deb466-478f-4ccd-980f-1e5a8c8ffe3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"99533053-5485-4834-8d8a-88056f49797c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e99406f7-66ab-4c7f-bd41-035bc6244443.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II","Overview":"Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China.

The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops.

In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","Publisher":"Dempa Shimbunsha","ReleaseDate":"1984-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"188155":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KD Office","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"44bb9c35-4c2f-4c4f-8524-80054e042af8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Kage no Soubashi: Shite Honzon","Overview":"Kage no Soubashi: Shite Honzon is a Strategy game, developed and published by KD Office, which was released in Japan in 1989.","Publisher":"KD Office","ReleaseDate":"1989-01-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"190177":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7046f342-d235-4c54-b566-a1f58f2baeab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7f5e732c-890c-4cb0-8982-32fabb03b5e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"198X-nen","Publisher":"CSG","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"190178":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"153ca83d-4ec4-44bf-9c51-f2764b5d5823.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c775d6f-2f04-423c-8fc7-b70491a84fbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1edb5543-3cae-46b3-9caf-0cfec3dd5d60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Arion","Overview":"Game follows the story of anime with the same title.\nIn Thrace, Arion is taken from his mother Demeter by the god Hades.

Finally, Arion and Geedo (a huge ape-like creature who had become Arion's friend and companion) left the Underworld to find Zeus. Seneca, a small thief, makes off with Arion's sword and this leads Arion to his first encounter with the forces of Zeus, commanded by his daughter Athena.

Characters can be moved in eight directions and three buttons are used to execute the moves. The game takes place in a large ring with a referee, but it is also possible throw out a wrestler at the bottom and continue fighting below. The referee will start a countdown then and the wrestlers have twenty seconds to get back in the ring. A single round takes three minutes. The wrestlers can brawl with a large amount of moves, from kicks and punches to holds, pins, throws, piledrivers, hurtling an opponent into the ropes to make them run into an elbow and so on. Wrestler health is shown through coloured pain waves the wrestlers radiate when they are down. Yellow waves usually refer to a short stun, while red ones are dangerous as they can lead to a game-ending pin as the referee counts down. There is a score system and three circles near the top of the screen are used to keep track of the standings over different rounds.","Publisher":"Micronet","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"193291":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0a3eb146-e483-4b7b-8af6-94713d6a07d1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0bcd6d8d-e29e-427f-a35f-909952d5b125.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4febd255-3314-4b88-ac39-0d961b4ce11e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"445e38dc-73c4-4a90-ae91-26e36d7230a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crazy Spy","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"193292":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"M.N.M Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"957589c0-d4cb-4033-a243-04dc60d79239.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"82879d51-0e53-4e56-92b1-7f220a7e4149.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Curse of Mars","Publisher":"Dempa Shinbunsha","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"193293":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Carry Lab","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8eff4ce0-ee65-42e4-912c-ce4bec715032.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back"},{"FileName":"0282b650-0eb2-4688-a830-b34f27a262a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"19428e5c-cf7f-4904-96c0-7deb99beb8dd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f8c93322-bbfc-4281-913d-2d47f5186d87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1babfd13-2afe-401e-b391-2934c083a493.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aa275ac0-4183-461f-b63f-773288e18c2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Daidassou","Overview":"You have to infiltrate a hostile fortress and free five POWs.

It’s the direct predecessor to the Langrisser series (occasionally known as Warsong), which had as extensive a hand in defining the console SRPG genre as Nectaris and Fire Emblem. The player controls the army of the Land of Light, and has to repel the evil overlord Böser and his monsters. The player must build their army by spending points\/cash earned in the previous battle to acquire new units before the next. In order to maximize the player's chances of victory, they have to defeat as many enemy units as possible without letting them escape while securing their own units' safety to have the most spending money for the following conflict. Points are awarded based on the strength of the defeated enemy, but points are lost if members of your army are defeated. Turns do not necessarily alternate between the player and the computer. Rather, the side which begins a new round is determined by a coin toss. It was originally released in 1987 for the NEC PC-8801 computer. The game also has a Construction Mode that allows the player to create their own scenarios with units not found in the main game. These range from sci-fi units to members of Masaya's development team.

You will find villages, towns and castles in your travels in these lands. In each, you will find or be able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and clues. You will also find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be locked until you find the right person or learn the right spell.\n\nAlso within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.\n\nHowever, not all inhabitants are monsters.

The base itself can fire an unlimited amount of short-ranged missiles, but has limited manoeuvrability. In order to be able to withstand the constant enemy onslaught, the player must release the pilot from time to time, and have him explore the location on his own, leaving the base behind.\n\nThe pilot is equipped with a jetpack and can therefore jump much higher than the base, and generally move faster and more efficiently. He can fire independently of his movement, and his missiles are long-ranged. Three different shot angles are bound to three keys on the keyboard: up, straight, and down. The pilot, however, can fire only a limited amount of missiles, and will also run out of fuel for his jetpack. He will have to return to the base to recharge his ammo and to refuel.","Publisher":"Compac Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"193317":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"ff715d41-3b52-436c-a2ae-1935e3d3d071.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b7c915b8-6eb1-4dba-b1f3-1bf035f22fab.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eabfa708-2a0f-4906-b2e1-92ac12cf8035.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6bcc5742-b3c9-4c4f-bf88-46ea8d0dbad3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1d4f60fa-33fd-4687-985c-9d8bdfdb8ee4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jankyou","Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/tYQboNHlppk"},"193318":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Carry Lab","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"dfbd493e-5851-44d7-9915-a4655b514f85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3fb0ea85-2336-425a-9a5a-14b790760772.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4160c698-868c-4c5c-938e-050fb4c1ad0f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c70231b3-bd73-450d-b3e7-f1f5fea73c7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aa5bf1cd-c196-4110-8197-359fa6df8f24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jelda","Overview":"Jelda is a third-person shooter with 3-D wireframe graphics.

The combat system involves \"bumping into enemies\". There's also a magic system, with more spells becoming available as you level up.

Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.\n\nThe Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the game environment consists of maze-like passages made with pseudo-3D graphics.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player creates a party of six adventurers. There are six classes to choose from: knight, robber, sorcerer, cleric, paladin, and archer. Each character has six main attributes: might, endurance, accuracy, personality, intelligence, and luck, with each class requires proficiency in a specific attribute for effective functioning. There are also five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\n\nAs in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The party starts in a particularly weak state, equipped with only clubs and having no money. The player is free to explore most of the game's locations in any order, and there are few hints as to what needs to be done to advance the plot. Turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies typically take place against a group of monsters more or less equal in size to the player-controlled party, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain. It is also possible to try and bribe enemies or surrender to them before entering combat.\n\nThe game has no auto-mapping feature of any kind and it is only possible to save the player's progress at inns located in towns.\n\nThe TurboGrafx CD version of this game has significant differences.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"196740":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"91cd9171-dffc-492d-9c11-430313236939.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"76794429-7b37-4e33-893e-40f59ba0bdb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"7ff9d304-8d6b-45d8-8d22-20cf7912b157.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0a8064fe-4eb3-4fe7-afc2-497816f4c6c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"84478dd4-faf1-49b4-b877-94ef4d726aa1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Produce","Overview":"Four classmates of international ESP Institute - Gilbert, Toshio, Tina and Sayaka decide to spend their summer vacation together.
