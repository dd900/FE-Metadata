On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zJC4jbipDMg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FIFA_International_Soccer?oldformat=true"},"4839":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Grey Matter","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3c8fe61a-0ed2-43ee-ae96-78d6930610cd.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9c5c9122-8f67-43a9-bf73-4ef75d6129ac.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"60316f33-f546-4de8-9901-54e12491f975.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0982f9a1-6ee1-497b-bbf7-d3c7c3d91ce8.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"14c7251a-0ffd-4045-9529-aef0ae9a2304.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4f8b9caa-07cc-4642-a888-419d36d2397d.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"06efb5c8-f589-4cd3-a1b4-6ce7daebeae7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aa09f32c-c642-402b-afb1-d5e276027257.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b1a1c1da-449d-4750-b682-ad8d4ef50626.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7d02a46b-0b58-4ff5-b9c3-ce6eb3a87cc3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6c057edb-dd09-42f7-83e2-bb4a5bcc774b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"215fd291-e206-4dc0-b78a-73c5fc9d07d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"162a191b-b34c-485f-8d4a-56c46caf6dbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6082b75c-b9d3-4291-8746-dff19e6a6e3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Foes of Ali","Overview":"Foes of Ali is a 3-D boxing game with ten different boxers to choose from: George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Jimmy Ellis, Bob Foster, Joe Frazier, Sonny Liston, Ken Norton, Leon Spinks, Chuck Wepner and of course the games namesake Muhammad Ali.\n\nThere are three modes to choose from: Exhibition where the player can choose any boxer to fight another, or the player can choose any of Ali's historic fights to play, Tournament where a player fights a series of boxers in an 8 man tournament tree to become champion and Career Mode, where the player can only play as Muhammed Ali and fight the other boxers in order as he did in real life.\n\nPlayers fight opponents with the basic punch moves, jabs, uppercuts and hooks along with defensive moves like blocking and grabbing.

You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.\n\nMyst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. \n\nThe game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.","Publisher":"Panasonic","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tHMwWHgt_vQ&ab_channel=aspyd1979"},"4850":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Psygnosis","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"c3538dea-582a-4316-ab78-6e1562e6be5f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eaa7419e-53e9-46cd-bd3e-d187332435f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"161d3561-48bf-4600-b15d-65e4122f7d5c.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f71e4ce-6080-44e9-9d72-1483ea98427d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b94930b-f97d-498d-815c-611bc279030f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fa8cc59e-6c70-42c3-bf90-7d21ce7aa5fd.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a1430b0a-be9e-4b3a-b5c6-2821499f04c2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0940c3bd-41d8-4a57-b247-ca1ae5e45543.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bed74974-db6c-46f7-b15b-342744a24c28.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"765ec6ca-2af7-4576-bdd7-661701174f07.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Novastorm","Overview":"A behind-the-view perspective of a shooter's dream: Blast enemies against a cinematic backdrop.

For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other \"Road Rashers\" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. \n\nThere are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.\n\nThere are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.\n\nIf you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.\n\nThe remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.","Publisher":"EA","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dOKYgkr3mxs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Road_Rash_(video_game)"},"4857":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"c6ff9fe4-cbe3-4da6-a3ca-bbc4479c7e69.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4b8c32b7-c402-4c06-accd-71f6e1a7858d.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"71143581-9f34-49ba-8947-5901dfd2e5a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"550592e4-9edf-4194-b209-1cdf227e80ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9a68dec-0026-46af-8ccd-a7cce130384f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea6e2082-d543-4df6-8793-6610f1d350a8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"37e9fe3f-fe33-4013-b790-4f420251d4f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"742a8a7c-d8fe-43b2-b789-4ce4cd6fb7ed.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6d612ed9-be1b-4a7e-a575-b4b48b3b70a3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8155aba4-520c-4aee-9d72-18fb6402a683.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a9111664-9948-4478-9106-90839ab30739.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"9f701f55-2f0d-4c35-8a22-024d68c525ee.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e9e37c1a-aeed-47cb-a08b-0e2f415b734b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cd0b7f6a-2ded-4f66-87a3-f44f875c695b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Samurai Shodown","Overview":"In early Japan, a man named Shiro Tokisada Amakusa preaches a heretic religion.

Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.\n\nThe gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.\n\nYou can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.

With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. \n\nGameplay consists of conversations with your colleagues (displayed as live action video), animated exploration sequences, as well as puzzle-solving that mostly involves figuring out how to operate alien mechanisms. There is also a maze sequence and sporadic action-based tasks. There is no inventory to speak of, because, being a brain in a box. you have no pockets.\n\nAll the action takes place in an in-game window that is your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that is there to remind you that you are inside a machine. Three difficulty settings, in-game instruction and assistance, as well as a few extras (such as high-resolution pictures) are included.","Publisher":"Matsushita Corp","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=idDCtDsrEkk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Daedalus_Encounter"},"4880":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Toys for Bob","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"f47e75c8-73da-4284-a163-dab18726c4dd.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4b87872d-7303-48ae-81ff-99334402bfa2.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eaaeb25d-d32d-43e7-aeb7-4dcc3a1fd735.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6ebd73dc-d576-4cb2-bce6-621179d8c465.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7799fc08-92c5-4702-8613-48630bb60d9b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"690f22a5-72c9-4912-a55c-4184eb8e59ba.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"10ac2837-a377-4c1f-967f-b1486a7ba263.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c80ba0d3-f8f8-4fe7-af61-9fd7b287cd8b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"86a6c56d-84d1-419f-9845-d46515795112.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"adf534c3-d399-473b-bd24-fb84c7d2df1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Horde","Overview":"You are Chauncey, a serving lad who saves his monarch from choking on his meal.

Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.\n\nShops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.\n\nYou are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.\n\nIt can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.","Publisher":"EA","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l3tb7y9J6qE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Theme_Park_(video_game)"},"4882":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Over Drivin","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Over Driven'","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Road & Track Presents: The Need for Speed"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Electronic Arts Canada","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"f02ef3d2-573e-4377-99c3-a09c78ee6cb4.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"33d10320-b755-454c-9336-c239a0789aed.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"333f4c0c-2a24-4cb2-8fc8-713f74771e65.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f6cf91f6-137f-49f5-bdb1-80d0ff182a33.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a6fd1090-ff62-4f22-bb3d-443009143b2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"67fb37ae-5a46-4d57-a5f7-7e821c4f1787.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6baeaea1-4dd0-4d53-9bb6-ad80f8e2492b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"641fd1e8-8089-4dca-b841-de12421e71fe.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"09183ea5-8d4b-4d0b-ab64-bb5d333d9db7.png","Region":"Greece","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a9e82db9-4a70-4f06-a8d5-66a725968324.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6eebad6e-c757-4b97-a08b-6c4d309a53e5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c40660e4-bad5-46a3-9ce2-5f1914010433.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"114a9894-f944-4c11-afe3-77d1616c548a.PNG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b7e9d2f0-6dc2-4f93-a7e4-de5e26555f78.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Need for Speed","Overview":"Drive some of your favourite sports cars through wild and fast tracks, including the Dodge Viper, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porshe, Corvette, Mazda RX7, Toyota Supra Turbo, and Acura NSX.

Its purpose is to defend the mining installation from hostile attack. For this purpose the installation houses six powerful defense turrets installed around the crater, as well as a myriad of support systems for power generation and munitions stores for those armaments.\nThe game is reminiscent of the System Shock series in terms of gameplay. The player must explore the base in order to find items which is needed to establish a line of defense and ultimately escape the installation. This involves fighting off the invading enemies by deploying the defense turrets effectively and using the installation's computer terminals (called \"VOS terminals\") in order to hinder the intruder's advance.\n\nThe computer terminals in the game offer an unusual wide range of interaction. Players can use them to remotely control the defense turrets, load ammunition and inspect the turrets for damage and deploy combat droids within the installation's perimeters. Doors can be controlled from the VOS terminals in order to control access to the installation's different areas. The player can use this capability to lock in enemy forces in parts of the installation.\nA view of the VOS terminal GUI.\n\nThe game also allows the player to fight the invaders by shooting them, but this is discouraged by the fact that new enemies arrive with each passing wave of attacking ships. Also, any fighting in the installation greatly degrades the air quality in the immediate area once an enemy is destroyed. The computer might even seal doors to polluted areas, sometimes trapping the player. The player can dissolve the pollution by opening doors to adjacent areas, and the pollution levels can be monitored in the VOS terminal's environmental module.'\nDefensive software being modified for improved performance.\n\nThe installation consists of two major towers with seven floors each (the administrative and domestic blocks), three hangars, a service level, six turrets and a control room. All these are linked by a subway-train like transportation system named \"LIMO\". Several elevator systems also connect the different levels. This complex layout enables players to avoid enemies by choosing an alternate route to their destination.","Publisher":"Multisoft Co.","ReleaseDate":"1996-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=khZdnLJ3hdc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Defcon_5_%28video_game%29"},"10095":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Dragon Lore: The Legend Begins","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cryo Interactive","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d3645b45-5880-40bc-90e6-9d4c96913d7d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c7ee7652-e02f-483d-a0e2-c3a2d6beb4bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a8cd171c-24d8-47ce-ba84-11c2f3e0767a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7c6ce2c2-068e-4140-95b4-2d1311f06518.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2e71d620-3a04-40aa-877f-c20d083ddbb0.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"083017d2-bec2-4cc8-88e3-a9fa9bdcaeed.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5d565d05-cec8-4f53-aa2c-34161aee69f0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"94a81c22-ebcc-49eb-86c3-0646ebac5307.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7b4626db-0c22-4c1f-b871-aa907c92d802.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d973e9e9-cf66-4e11-81ec-2ed001d850e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dragon Lore","Overview":"You are Werner Von Wallenrod, an orphan living in a vivid, surreal realm lost in time.

The ending a player witnessed was based on their actions throughout the game. The 100% complete ending includes the good ending and the addition of the sounds of a newborn baby crying. Some players inexplicably concluded that this sound of a baby crying meant that the visibly not pregnant Laura gave birth at the end of the game, a storyline development that some misguidedly believed would lead directly into the sequel, D2.","Publisher":"IGS","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S_GcGfZEhVk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/D_(video_game)"},"25182":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The 3DO Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f93f8dca-0979-4104-a5df-535a9683945c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"290b755b-486f-4bc1-9326-5361c6f9ec53.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eb9f1eea-77ef-4282-94a9-472b4909b447.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"3DO Action Pak","Overview":"This is a four-game compilation pack that contains the following 3DO games:\n\n    Slayer\n    Shanghai: Triple-Threat\n    Soccer Kid\n    Dragon's Lair","Publisher":"The 3DO Company","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"25184":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sanai","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"b7d22e37-1cd9-478e-812f-3a3dd00d2006.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3a20e019-6531-4c47-b152-a5d5305c9da5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"42551153-451f-4b37-ae29-4dcdfdf08a81.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c6f89b0d-0e0a-497f-9ec0-f0de0906c58b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6d6f0363-a3d7-49f6-b1f6-6df0d33111b1.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9a056220-40c3-4edc-83c1-7718decc9abc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2a9b8946-c0d2-4ea7-94f5-3a48fc5f70cf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"77efddf8-0298-4ead-aa86-6e0afaa4b080.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AutoBahn Tokio","Overview":"Autobahn Tokio is a racing game released only in Japan for the 3DO.

There are in fact two stories in the game, featuring two different characters, who live in different provinces of the Empire. The boy Wallace enjoys a peaceful life with his family in a quiet village; the girl Rakjit witnesses persecution and death of her mother, and joins a resistance movement that specializes in magics. The paths of the two young people will eventually lead to the same goal - liberation of the world; but when and how it will be achieved, remains unclear...\n\nThe game plays for the most part like a traditional Japanese-style top-down RPG. Both Wallace and Rakjit eventually gather a party, which roams the world, visiting various locations and advancing the story in a predominantly linear fashion. Appearance of random enemies triggers a battle screen, which is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battle system is rather old-fashioned, with physical and magical attacks; level progression is automatic, as in most games of the genre.\n\nSometimes the game prompts the player to choose an action or a response; while the flow of the story is rarely influenced by the player's decision, the game keeps track of these decisions, evaluating the player's attitude between chapters.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1996-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gPdrioXXy8E"},"25189":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Koei","Genres":"Sports; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"f5068259-57e8-4761-8a63-21d3fa51730d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d1cde21b-36c9-4ffb-a96f-82424b448879.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d88a4253-8259-4dbc-a8d2-1a6e93df6c24.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"870693c9-eb35-4d3f-992e-a348592b198d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2fc112d0-bfd3-4a93-a910-177df37380d6.png","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Winning Post","Overview":"Winning Post lets the player take control of a stable of horse, breeding and training them for the ultimate goal, to win the French Grand Prix.\n\nThe player can hire breeders, trainers and jockeys and race in over 240 different races to earn more money to buy even better personnel and breed faster and stronger horses as well as keeping their horses healthy.

The end result was the Supervisor Droid, a machine capable of assuming any form and accessing any database. But when an EGO virus infected the Supervisor's self-awareness it started to consider its need above of those of the company, infecting the other robots in the plant and declaring itself their leader. Electrocorp then sent its top-secret ECO32-5 Cyborg to infiltrate the plant and destroy the supervisor.\n\nRise of the Robots is a versus fighting game. The player controls the ECO32-5 Cyborg and must fight all the other robots in the plant until finally meeting the Supervisor Droid. The controls consist of 3 buttons for punches and 3 buttons for kicks (one for each in the Game Gear version), and jumping, moving, crouching and blocking are performed with the directional pad. The Cyborg has two super moves, the Turbo Head Butt and the Shoulder Barge. The player can choose the difficulty, number of rounds and time limit for the fights, as well as turn turn the super moves off.\n\nThe game has three modes: mission, where the player fights each robot in a fixed order; training, where the player can fight any robot in any desired order; and two players versus mode (absent in the Game Gear version), where the second player chooses any of the enemy robots to fight with. It features an AI system that reacts to the player style, 3D rendered cutscenes and the title song was composed by Queen's guitarist Brian May.","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tu8k-yjFhFM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rise_of_the_Robots"},"26700":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Shadow Warriors","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tribeca Interactive","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"a7270bf5-dea1-4351-8a41-e15f1ddf0072.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1fb8bf75-d700-41d8-9f3e-795d0cfc8d2b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1dba29f0-b739-4add-ba0b-76de2e790f69.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6d3e1941-31a5-4cbb-b8a7-6b19ee103bfb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5ca13d59-7c68-4183-8268-aba2faca6d01.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cc52f89a-a3f3-4a91-9a82-bea44999d297.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1b261550-1581-449f-b5ee-1d7288105996.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Shadow: War of Succession","Overview":"The leader of S.H.A.D.O.W., the world's largest criminal organization, has just been brutally murdered.

Exploration is performed in first person, moving through the hallways in a fixed, grid-based system. Players can watch their minimap to track or avoid other bioforms. If the player encounters another mutant, the game switches to a tactical, turn-based fighting system. The player and the computer both try to target weak points on their enemy, with the winner of each turn shown attacking the other in an animated cutscene. The graphics are most noteworthy in using stop-motion puppets for all the bioforms, giving them a somewhat realistic look.\n\nN.O.B. was only released in Japan, and was one of the few games published by Sanyo.","Publisher":"Sanyo","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_iaZs7vzmIM&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=RetroGamesArchive"},"97670":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e20ea5b4-7f21-401d-8f6c-0681e79e924f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"31fd0b71-1c48-4fb4-86c4-b8e9c7f75137.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04bf70ab-bc6b-482d-9352-cc612794e233.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb478c67-f988-4371-8150-409259ed1c16.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7cc2c38d-d869-4eaa-9257-1a25971ba990.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"78129c42-1e7e-449b-bf82-ba06ae155e0d.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"25d24ced-f8ec-448f-8447-2115c96f7dae.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Murphy Dayo Zenin Shuugou!!: Murphy's TV CD-ROM","Overview":"Murphy Dayo Zenin Shuugou!! is a quite unusual Japanese only game.

This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress. In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing. It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game. Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat. The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"125017":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"AI Shogi","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"909466b2-a64c-48ab-a5d3-ec96fd9ae32f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3373fcbe-9f14-4d6f-8753-578da432119f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b15a2c4d-6e68-4d01-a1eb-355d535ac256.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f9d4f820-77ee-48ac-923c-bacc93f40721.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"044b4c72-369c-49ea-825e-247a2b042815.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8d245498-0875-4ff3-9dee-ec86a16d23bc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"AI Shougi","Overview":"AI Shougi is a Board game, developed and published by Taito and released in Japan in 1995.","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hdXK4CDryGU"},"126267":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"OpenBook Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"58d3d97a-3dcd-4abf-8b25-6e6d0bbc258d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"90bdb58c-98d0-4c06-bd73-f70d9c9f8a66.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"66e7174b-05cc-4ac9-9f06-02674adb6f17.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f1a4f7ef-fa4e-43a2-8bcc-2ff2c725c508.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e0326fc6-dd3e-4fe6-97b3-115e4a7cf988.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Tower","Publisher":"OPeNBooK","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SimTower"},"126268":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Humongous Entertainment","Images":[{"FileName":"53696c8f-b6ca-46e0-9d38-a0e05bb3b0a6.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"506dc3af-063a-4448-a375-bd8522e53a8f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2898c375-0e24-4538-beab-f85850ab4d5d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"db33a393-b1eb-4d9e-bb2c-2e4b877ba698.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"35deafc5-eafc-4ac3-8e10-2a67208fe867.png","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Putt-Putt's Fun Pack","Publisher":"Humongous Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-26T00:00:00-08:00"},"126269":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Putt-Putt to Parade ni Ikou!","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Humongous Entertainment","Genres":"Adventure; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"de5efdf7-ec1a-426b-9acc-48c0b7436535.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"c25e4132-32a1-4049-ac05-af79113a69e8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b3841643-cc25-4cf2-b120-7b7d317c7b68.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7826c87-ff05-4529-b6dc-413b0f00f461.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e415192-c44f-4a79-be26-6e1d19b7d295.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"00f3ad9a-bcd4-4721-9d62-bedf088232fa.png","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Putt-Putt Joins the Parade","Overview":"Putt-Putt, an adorable purple car, wants to join the Cartown Parade.

You play a chief inspector Totsukawa, a fictional detective created by Kyoutarou Nishimura (西村 京太郎), a Japanese writer of a mystery novels. The victim appears to be living in a nearby apartment, and after checking the crime scenes and gathering clues, talking to witnesses and person who found the body would be the next logical step.\n\nUnlike the PSP version release 15 years later, this game uses live-action during both cut-scenes and in-game investigation while gameplay relies of icons which let you listen to what others have to say, talk to witnesses and suspects, and investigate the crime scenes. At the beginning of each day you start with a meeting to discuss what you've uncovered thus far with your subordinates and decide what to do and where to go next. Each day progresses as you move from location to location, leaving you with limited number of locations you can visit before the day ends, so following clues and figuring out where is the best thing to go next is of utmost importance in order to solve the crime.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"129921":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Scitron & Art","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"9f03ed2a-f91a-42ba-ba60-981336bf6cb9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4cf95796-56db-46c6-81a2-def9bfb1ab21.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"75794c2d-d30e-46da-83a4-da33fe14a22f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e868ba61-fde3-4f49-961e-01b17c5735db.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9afb3c52-16db-4f8e-b9aa-70e939287d0e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Paddock Note '95","Publisher":"Scitron & Art","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"129922":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gaga Communications","Images":[{"FileName":"4c3e55b4-9cee-45cd-ae4b-25e3ad7f5db9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d67c681a-7684-48c1-b1de-364b50685e37.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2f23a62c-49ff-43d2-be75-51a7a817b19c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fc87ae27-9c39-4310-b6d2-4b179623c4a3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6810fadb-476a-4581-9cfa-1f43a22d50c7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Penthouse Interactive: Virtual Photo Shoot Vol. 1","Overview":"You're a photographer who wants to work for Penthouse.

Jerry Randolph, a female reporter working for the Chicago newspaper \"Daily Casablanca\", finds a diary belonging to her high school friend May Elgar, who has disappeared several years ago under mysterious circumstances. Jerry discovers that May's father was working on a groundbreaking scientific project. Too late to save Dr. Elgar from untimely death, Jerry uses a time machine constructed by him to travel to 1916, following the traces left by the criminals. In spite of its title, the game has little to do with the famous movie Casablanca beyond a few loose references. It is a text adventure with graphics, in which the player types text commands to interact with the environment. Several useful commands (including Look, Search, Take and Knock) can be accessed directly through function keys. Limited navigation between screens can be performed with directional arrows. English text input is supported to a certain degree, though text descriptions are in Japanese only.","Publisher":"Matsushita","ReleaseDate":"1994-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"129971":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"327f7c67-73da-4edf-b73d-f6b115227a70.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2b58a9fd-bcf5-42a2-b275-cb82834c6eb6.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a8abefc-5bb2-41f6-80a4-b9ecfb3fdcb3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6223da7b-6e15-483c-a5ca-1c3da8e27c55.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"ToonTime ...in the classroom","Publisher":"Videoact V","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"129973":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Warp","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"eb7ea357-825a-4866-bdee-1b915df9778c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c4748c7f-c193-46c1-a14d-a22359365660.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c1436600-75ab-4c9d-a6e5-e437a4447a69.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9459c5b0-4bb8-41a6-964c-b5e568257e27.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5e5d7ba0-72db-4ac2-975d-fc51e261b574.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ae3c3125-7d01-4863-b20b-438dfc37cd2b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"b4c5a8f9-2df3-423f-9480-cbc3d75afc6a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"07b5b9ff-8494-419c-893a-d17050e85deb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Totsugeki Karakuri!

The protagonist of the story is Akiko Sonoyama (園山千晶), freelancer who finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery after the son of the host dies during the dinner right after drinking the wine. The game uses live-action videos and actors and shows the player protagonist in 3rd-person during investigation, similar to other games of such era, such as The Beast Within or Phantasmagoria 2. During gameplay, the full-screen videos appear in the center of the screen with surrounding window showing various action icons and game progress. While the player character appears during cut-scenes and dialogues, navigating environment is done using 1st-person perspective. During dialogues player has a list of questions one can ask with replies being a set of live-action videos of certain character addressing the player.\n\n15 years after the 3DO game release, the PSP remake with the same title was released. The main difference there is that live actors have all been removed and characters were replaced with silhouettes and game interface changed to look like a mystery visual novel but with a selectable actions such as talk or inquire which make the game less of a typical visual novel and only resemble it in graphical presentation by using static backgrounds with dialogue text over it.","Publisher":"Matsushita Electric Industrial","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"129986":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zinc Studios","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"f9f97837-e96d-4986-aca1-7d7a7b735bba.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BIOS Fear","Overview":"Little is known about this title as it was never released.

The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics. \n\nAction sequences are similar to those of Snatcher, but are more numerous and varied.
