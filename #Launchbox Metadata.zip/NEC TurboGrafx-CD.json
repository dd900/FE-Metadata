The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...\n\nLike most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a \"hub\" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.","Publisher":"NEC Technologies, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9987":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pomping World","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Mitchell Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"916ab988-e0de-46f4-be24-9e020e01023d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5bb72a52-f897-4a98-925c-588fe25f60f5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8442ea86-21c3-44f2-959c-96a4067c7f7b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b8311c7a-f91b-4a56-aebf-1d28655ff02c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6556ae18-ebdf-4f76-9abc-74adc339595a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"02fd8737-483a-41ef-b262-9f0f493c802d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8037f1b8-37c2-4a87-aa87-ebf86a80ef7f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b3295778-3b36-4b07-a363-bea3395e6c77.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"929a1e41-79c9-4cb8-b469-b7361b7b7076.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5cb559b9-847a-4326-b59d-c9ff60b7aefc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"e3e481ac-c1be-4be0-bdd2-48cf2c68acc6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Buster Bros.","Overview":"Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield.

One day his sweetheart Laura gets kidnapped by an unknown villain. Van soon discovers that Laura possesses mysterious powers that may grant immortality to the one who marries her. That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time.\n\nCosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: Bōken Shōnen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes.\n\nLike the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks.

The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.\n\nEach draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be \"reversed\", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nCKoVLIxcHI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Loom_(video_game)"},"10000":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Rising Sun","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cinemaware Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"b0b9ceaf-5ce4-404c-9756-44fba0b022b4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"41b2c3e1-fb4b-4fd9-a8ec-e3c810e65811.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3a39a6ca-6a8c-4c55-9ed1-f27bdb26f526.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"32188ae2-1968-4595-b61e-cb827cc3e2b6.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30b58d1f-6fdb-41ad-8d66-bed678e5c07d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0fd82a35-5e91-4d04-9765-b2f068509a28.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"77cbe1e5-bbc6-4fd2-9694-245f47c9fc0d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3e576812-6629-4196-a271-839cad8f0738.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d0db607b-535e-4fb6-b5a6-de8f9d9a7d72.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a99d8b34-8815-4d4b-9052-40478505292e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"33916cd7-3b5a-47af-895a-4373730ac25f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"561b3df1-5eb3-46bb-9f75-1716a35ece80.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"77474fc6-418d-4150-806a-15dee6605a9a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lords of the Rising Sun","Overview":"Japan, 12th century.

Transformations require special gems and cannot be performed if Lykos runs out of them. There are four transformations in the game: the panther can jump over large gaps; the shark can swim; the golem can jump higher; and the golden dragon can fly. Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.\n\nThe game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area.

Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games.

The dark priest Shaft has kidnapped Annette Renard, Richter's main love interest, and taken her to Castlevania along with a handful of other female victims. Wielding an ancestral whip imbued with holy powers to crush darkness, Richter heads out into the night alone to rescue the victims and deal out some justice, Belmont style.\n\nThe game is divided up into multiple stages, some hidden, where the goal is to reach the end of each and (usually) face a boss monster. Along the way you may collect hearts from candles to power one of 6 different subweapons; the dagger, holy water, axe, cross, grimoire, and stopwatch. Each subweapon has a specific style of use and special \"Item Crash\" attack, which allows for an expensive but devastating super attack.\n\nNumerous hidden secrets may be found during the adventure, opening up pathways to new stages or leading to one of the four victims to rescue; one of which becomes a playable character after being freed. The victims Richter is able to rescue will affect which of the multiple endings you will see. Even if a maiden is missed, however, the player can return to any unlocked level later and take another shot at discovering any secrets they may have missed via the main menu's stage select.\n\nRondo of Blood has great looking graphics, serves up multiple endings, plenty of secrets to discover, offers a decent difficulty level, and a delivers a quality soundtrack.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0BPn4hGmYts","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castlevania:_Rondo_of_Blood"},"18391":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CAProduction","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"00bf2bb5-17f0-48bd-ab9f-67f8245ad2d8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"27e39cf8-33a6-483a-bce5-e98be07c1164.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc9dba9d-2593-459a-a944-a4677362b01d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0176d49a-3fcd-4347-9b54-32a53f7407c3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e3912893-d0d2-41dc-b0d4-1b36952fee12.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d9535f5e-507b-4027-b3c2-7f29c0295d00.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1adfa051-8f45-465a-ade1-af07f8d93ad7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ginga Fukei Densetsu: Sapphire","Overview":"Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire is a 1995 shoot 'em up video game released by Hudson Soft for the PC Engine console (with the Arcade CD-ROM add-on) in Japan only.\n\nIt is renowned as one of the most technically impressive titles for that system, as well as one of the rarest.

The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lemmings_(video_game)"},"18394":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Masaya","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"f62b9ac5-3060-4ac3-a266-08771f7b50fd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"90d9d939-e3c5-42dd-a2db-5081d580e820.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e88fc6b8-40b4-45c9-a59e-9ce968085adb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b289d27e-d2e8-4e4c-887e-a04f932c76c2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"765ea60f-3f66-45d5-b3a9-ca940b4f0163.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3424bf05-ba5e-485a-a47c-eb958a47e2ea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Motoroader MC","Overview":"A change in style for the Moto Roader series, Moto Roader MC plays and looks more like the arcade game Super Sprint than the previous installments.","Publisher":"NCS","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18395":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"AlfaSystem Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"4c8ebfe3-9fb6-4c70-a1c9-bd502f95137c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fbd8b649-3e10-4693-80c0-40807d4b19b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"24afe6bf-64da-467a-9971-6e366600eeeb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"13c8c010-2fe4-45d9-9ea8-464dad0c227e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"22b62787-9c4d-46fd-babc-8c2fce746f1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9b9cf13c-ab9c-43cb-9bd1-4f412d23509a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Psychic Storm","Overview":"Psychic Storm is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of four characters who must protect Neo Hong Kong City from an assault by vicious insectoid aliens.

The transformation can be performed at any time as long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty.

You can also eject these orbs, which act as a smart bomb in times of need.","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kb5q0mXmIo4"},"18397":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"12edb3f1-1e47-4906-97e9-3ff61081d013.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b9995e0e-30e8-4296-bda3-099ae7067445.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28655cde-f5ef-481d-9131-7a4c55690f73.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3533c35d-76bd-4136-9b1c-61dea66d7264.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"83cacec5-f369-48bc-a761-f47192670d63.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1276e58e-ffee-41ea-bc00-6a171bd5833f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spriggan Mark 2: Re-Terraform Project","Overview":"Spriggan Mark 2: Re-Terraform Project is an Action game, developed by Compile and published by Naxat Soft, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18399":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"スチーム·ハーツ","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TGL","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"f691f153-aca2-442f-9d97-4e428e95e2e1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"26df97a3-1d23-4ef1-8cdc-791583664fa2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d2ec3cc7-d62d-4b35-a551-b3bae293cd49.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"db62c455-6cb1-471e-8110-dbc844c68fc7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a19645e6-a111-450f-b3f6-9537068c6335.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7372964c-7c12-45d9-a0fa-2de966640ec5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Steam-Heart's","Overview":"In the far future, on an alien planet dominated by princesses, a spell of a unique virus has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare all-out war. \n\nOnly Blondia Varady and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and administer the antidote.

The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.\n\nThe Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.\n\nThe combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal \"punch-kick\" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.","Publisher":"Toho Co.,Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18849":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Westone","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a0e84e1b-82c6-4885-a11d-884d0597bea8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2d1f7078-a3e7-4d27-818e-f54c96bf3786.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9a144c7a-c34d-4bdd-99f4-22cd741e5d0a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2e88587-9db5-4e01-b98d-2b91ddfaa640.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a5a2f1b2-d8a4-426c-aab2-e24db420174c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d8cd9de-80db-4699-a296-ac3fdbfc4afb.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d929e86-104c-447b-98b3-4bbe9d546b06.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4453bf5a-fa41-4b18-a0b5-b311787ea06e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c1f8318a-a0e5-455d-8d6a-70a216e7070d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6062973a-7e11-4757-af2b-a0aabec8ec86.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"432a6aa3-a3ad-456c-b2f7-f78b5c4db75d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ee62a166-e785-468a-9ad5-b703f5934b21.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa5fed63-a3cb-4b0e-aa52-7798cdf7282a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b5f4218-9a16-45f4-b5ca-48373ac5c688.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Monster Lair","Overview":"Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series.

A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. \n\nIn the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene.

Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.\n\nIf your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life.

This game's events happen 15 years after those of Valis III and introduce a new protagonist: Lena Brande.\nStory\nHundreds of years ago, the king Asfal from the Dark World had a son, Galgear, who was driven insane by the power of a ring that he inherited from his father, causing wars and widespread destruction in order to make that power grow constantly.\n\nConsequently, the gods imprisoned Galgear and his followers in a giant crystal and sank it under the seas.\n\nMany centuries have passed and the crystal emerges to the surface once again with Galgear and his army broken free, bringing an end to the short-lived era of peace enjoyed by Vecanti after Glames' defeat in Valis III.\n\nWith his reign of chaos reestablished, Glames takes over Vecanti and starts to take over the human world also. Galgear then kidnaps Vecanti's current queen, Valna, and prepares her execution.\n\nMeanwhile, a resistance force in the dream world led by Cham tries to fight Galgear's regime but this seems to be useless. Lena, a member of the resistance, decides to rescue Valna along with her sister Amu. Although Cham isn't in accordance with her, she hears Yuuko's voice telling her to let Lena go. Having no other option, Cham teaches them some basic things and then stays behind in Vecanti guarding the city and the survivors.\n\nLena and Amu manage to infiltrate Castle Vanity and defeat the first of Galgear's generals, Dhalgen. Then they find Valna and try to rescue her just to be stopped and injured by Galgear himself, meeting him personally for the first time. Just as he is going to deal the heroines the final blow, they are teleported away by a stranger who reveals himself to be Asfal, Galgear's father himself, who also wants to stop his son's evil regime. He tells Lena that the only thing that can defeat his son is the Valis sword, which isn't in this world anymore, and that they have to reach Valhalla in the sky in order to obtain It from Yuuko, the most recent Valis warrior and current guardian of the sword.\n\nAfter overcoming many obstacles, they meet Yuuko who warns Lena about the things she will have to live as a Valis warrior by showing her memories and asks if she still wants to become a Valis warrior. Lena answers decidedly that she will accept that destiny if she can save the three worlds from Galgear. Yuuko then tests her with satisfactory results and gives her the Valis sword and thus the Valis armor.\n\nAfterward, the three protagonists make their way into the human world to reach the giant crystal Galgear uses as his base. After beating many of his henchmen and his last two generals, they find Galgear trying to kill Valna once again. It seems to be too late to save her, but Amu steps in front of Galgear's axe throw, saving Valna's life but being mortally injured.\n\nAsfal releases Valna and holds off his son while Amu dies in her sister's arms. Lena then addresses Galgear, saying that she will put an end to him once and for all. Galgear challenges her to come and fight him in his lair, the red moon, where Asfal lived when he was king.\n\nLena and Asfal open a path to the red moon where they fight Galgear, defeating him sucessfully. Asfal and Galgear apologize to each other respectively for all that has happened, after which Galgear dies in the arms of his father. Lena then goes to Amu's grave to pay her last respects and starts to walk toward the horizon, asking herself what will await in the future.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. \n\nThis version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fray_in_Magical_Adventure"},"25035":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fc04b56a-6452-4806-94fb-5562a1fd899e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"873dfc33-952d-477e-bd63-8179c661ec11.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"089fe091-0ef8-424d-ad8f-29738019963f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5ad70b5e-99d0-40ab-9fdb-64ead014f247.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bbd3ad4e-b690-4d2e-888a-9f15230dd0ac.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"8a9504f2-8e05-4073-b7af-fdb958df1da5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hyper Dyne: Side Arms Special","Overview":"Side Arms Special is, in essence, the same game as the regular edition of the arcade side-scrolling shooter Side Arms (with audio CD tracks instead of MIDI music) - plus a new gameplay mode called Before Christ.\n\nThis mode can be considered a \"hardcore mode\", since the player has to return to the beginning of the level after the player character has died, as opposed to losing a \"life\" and continuing from the same spot in the regular mode.

Power-up pods increase your firepower a little each time, while hidden Minmay heads give extra lives.","Publisher":"Masaya","ReleaseDate":"1992-04-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"25542":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"nec adventure","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8e03ecf7-5b2f-4f84-a00b-9be9892ee538.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a37c27d9-0c62-478d-857e-a4f15bbdb781.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"38fda520-5bce-4a80-ab7f-28f9f3da4a56.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"afe632f0-96a2-48db-bb08-f197220cfc95.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b379523c-efea-4947-9da2-d3696569be23.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ddd904a1-9479-4d2f-b118-29ee88fd6f95.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7b73333f-8b4a-4385-97bf-4c8fab163779.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Download 2","Overview":"Shoot 'em up sequel that takes place over a series of very different and sometimes surreal landscapes.","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-29T00:00:00-08:00"},"26638":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Double Dragon 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NAXAT Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"50ee50e8-b137-41be-98b0-1dfba4c728b8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2c6ca599-974d-4a02-a749-6170260b0842.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e0db746d-4362-42da-9f82-7a949b01ffe3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eec873ba-a907-48b1-abe3-7ed92f34a276.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"73a59c46-ebb4-4c82-b9a7-32945b796dea.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e73e7482-0556-46d3-a95c-dad431f57f89.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1d83a973-dc87-46a0-9346-be8648b000a6.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5bc1e43f-b9d8-45d9-80c0-66f2ebb37f78.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f06de749-4191-4c71-ae97-fd7ac878d5e6.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ceaa20c9-0ddd-47bb-aae0-47fed4b08f1f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Double Dragon II: The Revenge","Overview":"In the year 2000,  A nuclear strike has left New York City in disaster and law and order have taken a backseat to crime and violence.

The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.\n\nThe game is set in the inner half of the solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius.\n\nThe red\/green\/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function: respectively, upgrades to the \"missile\" main weapon and \"bomb\" subweapon, and a shield to absorb some damage. Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new \"laser\" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons.\n\nActually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before.\n\nAnother new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as \"captains\"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In Darius II, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.","Publisher":"NEC","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"29743":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cyber City Oedo 808: Kemono no Alignment","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Computer Systems","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6a5f8b17-72a1-4eff-97e0-3888cf7056c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b90bf371-e14d-4cf4-a14b-11f119bb3d90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f2936dc6-ace5-4e96-b966-1487e9d23ff8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7c45d43-9e97-4bf9-b90a-d5e7835b428f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5b6ed276-09d4-4cbe-af58-53eda04c7bc5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cyber City Oedo 808: Attribute of the Beast","Overview":"Cyber City Oedo 808: Attribute of the Beast (CYBER CITY OEDO 808 獣の属性 Saibāshiti Ōedo Hachimaruhachi: Kemono no Zokusei?) is a graphic adventure game released on March 15, 1991 for the PC-Engine CD-ROM² by Nippon Computer System exclusively in Japan.

At various points (and between each level) you will encounter tiny little humanoids dressed in blue or green - the green ones drop food to increase your health bars, the blue ones drop magic potions (although you have to put the boot in to get anything from them). Each character is able to cast magic spells, and the more potions you have, the more impressive and powerful the spells are. Gilius casts lightning spells, which are the weakest, Ax casts earthquake spells and Tyris casts powerful fire spells which can be powered up to give you a giant dragon that breathes flames all over the landscape.","Publisher":"Telenet","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golden_Axe_(video_game)"},"29747":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"GS Mikami","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Banpresto","Images":[{"FileName":"397aff5c-f38e-4c51-824b-0a62d9aa39d8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4642fdf9-a89a-4f2c-9975-1c2e9d6950fa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dd7c1b35-4f43-4d5c-82ee-b320a8090fd7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Ghost Sweeper Mikami","Overview":"Ghost Sweeper Mikami (GS美神) is a video game released only in Japan for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM² in 1994 by Banpresto.

The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five characters.\n\nThe player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu; the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"29750":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b3efaf55-06fd-413f-a374-62b99974920c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cd6cfad5-8164-4cd7-b69d-8803ccca9b06.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce9675fd-9098-4cd9-85b4-9a1d64842f74.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ce27359e-14c7-473c-b99d-edd3b945a38e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4d5162f7-4d78-4740-9619-a1fb777d64bf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"33701561-773a-49f4-8af3-9fa89925fa85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Metamor Jupiter","Overview":"Sci-fi shoot 'em up.\nThe following information was kindly provided by Brandon Sheffield of www.insertcredit.com: Metamor Jupiter represents the first (major, he had one previous collaboration) foray into games by musician\/designer Masaya Matsuura, of Parappa the Rapper fame. Matsuura, hot off the disbanding of his pop group PSY'S, wrote a vocal song and some incidental music for the game. As for the game itself, it's a rather standard shooter, but is also notable as an early creation of Flight Plan, the developer that went on to create such notable titles as Summon Night, Black\/Matrix, Poison Pink, et al. Definitely worth a go if you're a fan of either Matsuura or Flight Plan, and a decent enough, if merely workmanlike effort otherwise. Try it. \nI actually bought a copy of this game when last I was in Tokyo, and presented it to Matsuura at his office during an informal interview. He was incredibly surprised to see the game, as he'd lost the original copy of the track, and ripped the disc on the spot in order to get it back! Pretty nifty. Honestly though, I only played it for about 30 minutes. It's really quite ok, but is way more interesting for its history than anything else.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-01-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"29751":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ranma 1-2","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Ranma ½: Ni Bun no Ichi","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NCS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f3ac4796-a493-4365-bc8f-0942e1747831.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e368eec8-621e-4fd3-a75a-e0e986b1f0f6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed7cbf99-70ed-4a47-bb6b-04a962f83c88.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c1a7621f-3d31-445d-9d9b-c6a109423e76.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9190d3bc-875d-4ce1-880e-92d7743aa8b7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"66b95a0a-3228-4f6b-aa20-2b2f4feaf450.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"073515de-f991-4885-a2f4-9aa010e5ac74.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ranma ½","Overview":"The first Ranma 1\/2 game based on Rumiko Takahashi’s popular manga.

But three years after the attack, a space probe detects unknown objects hurtling towards planet Earth. The signs are clear - a massive alien invasion is underway. After a first encounter around Saturn, Image Fight requires the player to progress through four \"simulation stages\" - the last six \"real stages\" can only be accessed if the \"simulation\" achievement rating is greater enough. Failing this requirements leads to a short but intense Penalty Area. All the primary weapons from the original game are also here for the taking. Up to three colored orbs can be attached to the ship and either fire forwards (blue) or in the opposite way the ship is moving (Red). Secondary devices are also available and can be equipped at the front of the ship - they include all kind of lasers and missiles.

In 2012, Earth is once again under attack and a large armada of enemy ships approaches our blue world. The player pilots the Slasher, a powerful space fighter, and prepares to face the oncoming threat. The introduction story is told through a series of fully animated cutscenes and reveals the intricate plot of the game. We learn that stopping the invasion is not our pilot's only goal - he is also on a quest of revenge after a fatal encounter with a large red mecha and the terrible loss, in front of his very eyes, of a close friend and fellow female pilot. He makes his way towards the enemy lines on his own, ready to launch a deadly ambush attack. The Slasher starts its mission with a standard Vulcan gun (\"Rapid Shot\/Wide Shot\") and more weapons are available along the way such as homing flame-lasers (\"Guided Fire\"), side missiles (\"Crawl Missile\"), lasers, shields and secondary flying pods (\"Funnel\"). Unlike most of its peers, Nexzr is as bare as it gets on the weapon\/power-up side. It features only one fire button and weapons have a single power level and can't be powered-up, without forgetting the total lack of smart bombs. Interestingly, the option menu offers a special arcade mode that shrinks the screen horizontally and offers a narrower field of view.","Publisher":"Kaneko","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"33033":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rayforce","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b90a7a5f-6d19-487a-8984-f4a62c754944.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"793d2adf-016f-4a89-91d2-22436e53308e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dcfcf7e3-180f-4a71-b550-9b0a6697cbfd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4d16ab7a-28c8-4d9b-9e31-f78c9a915b1b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46de39f0-9128-4023-b3fa-41d31a1061bc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d2b9494-bc35-4274-9eb9-8762545efdbe.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b40d683f-ffb6-457a-856a-d819d4efc61a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d385a5ba-164d-4f32-b01a-71b3e0c8d58f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Startling Odyssey II: Maryuu Sensou","Overview":"A mad scientist named Dr. Killbait succeeded in resurrecting one of the eight ancient dragons, endangering the country of Hyneld.

The game is set in a predominantly medieval fantasy-themed world with a touch of sci-fi, and plays like a traditional Japanese RPG. The player navigates a party of characters on a top-down overworld, visiting cities and dungeon-like areas. Enemies are encountered randomly. Battles are viewed from isometric perspective, with an \"auto\" option to speed up combat. \n\nCharacters join the party as dictated by the plot; the party will eventually contain four active combatants. Each character has his or her own sets of offensive, supporting, or healing spells, which are learned automatically when the character levels up.

The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors\/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level).

So, the object of the game is basically to hatch the most eggs & get the chicks to your home before anyone else... There are 3 worlds, each containing 10 levels which are all selectable at anytime... The game follows much the same look & feel as the Bomberman series, similarly, it allows up to 4 simultaneous players for multi-barrels of fun.","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1997-04-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34131":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MindRec","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"aa959012-f9e1-4e44-b535-5f5dd3ba9f72.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5245d04c-dece-4c38-933a-34c6960f6b5f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"de01e589-acec-42ca-a3d4-5aa5ba25f433.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6bfb09c-e9c7-486b-a47a-4a95005b9715.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c3d7b5cb-c347-4d2c-8a2f-568095e254a6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5c2631a4-3bf9-465e-949f-ed5c637a2fe6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"48d19007-faf8-46bb-bd19-79a73b2b4e20.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7f631fa6-0605-4a7d-995e-691c93b5ff93.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d7d52119-9c8c-4efb-b2ea-6b31ec476116.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4dd01dd0-d81e-415f-ba96-df7cde26e52f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"311c4b0e-34bc-4ede-8ae5-1cadf5a42945.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Implode","Overview":"Implode is a homebrew puzzle game.

Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.\n\nCardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The \"free play\" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-09T00:00:00-08:00"},"94103":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Flight-Plan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"48f69b8f-4a1e-462e-8b39-25c0645801e0.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"48a2295d-1246-42c1-9b31-7a79662f9bbb.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fa2a1ea9-689a-4a77-b2f0-4311fead0706.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c6ec336b-d30d-41c4-ac5c-ba54d8401833.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7c07e4a1-5759-4afd-8759-31298846092d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1f9b9a54-a30b-407e-9267-9641c41be8f4.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b1458e06-ba9b-4cfb-a5fb-888d4ee575a7.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f32ec5a1-7ca6-496c-9518-47f63601c470.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3fb65720-15d3-4e91-b327-61ed0744d09e.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e64d9202-eda9-47c4-ab07-fe6ac4930b41.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"317c7b46-0ba5-4c35-a17a-1a6e0c70aab6.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"57428f61-fd12-4bc8-bbf8-9aac9d7efa17.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"857b9385-ba36-4432-9ada-966b8c3e8528.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"80dd6e72-2e4e-4f9c-b755-4103543349b9.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"510c8575-0738-4424-8692-732e3787c93a.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c4bfeef7-3053-4fd5-86b5-701d9c318ace.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Chiki Chiki Boys","Overview":"This platform-based action game is set in the land of Alurea.

The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called gekokujou situation, when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his\/her own character. Character creation is Ultima-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.\n\nThe gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and maneuvering the troops.","Publisher":"ASK Kodansha","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AiY__0DbEu4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_PC_Engine_games"},"105952":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"A.III. - A Ressha de Ikou III","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Artdink Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"895ea22b-f131-463e-87e4-bc45b80f8bef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ef636f39-4095-412c-8102-3939fd519055.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4bd00834-e1c8-4ebf-a953-616a8b230640.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0dfe46e-9a42-46ad-ae6c-c45add0604ee.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3764db87-29d7-4b86-9d2d-13478a2038a6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d41c849b-2576-41b7-bff0-2d85c6a19a80.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ac6bb6bc-b6f7-419e-ad72-de5049c785f0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d3ed015a-6d07-4c41-a697-40703eadd645.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"A III","Overview":"AKA Take the A-Train III\n\nPlay the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating a railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world.

Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.\n\nA young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercraft. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.\n\nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks, whereas the TurboGrafx CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.","Publisher":"Victor Entertainment Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"105985":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Alzadick","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NAXAT Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ef5ce1bf-24bb-4ae2-8f9a-0bbad59f6404.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"937568be-ec5b-4ba3-967a-55804cc4abaf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4e07bc32-ee63-401b-bf91-f07e3e2a8de7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6c6d17a9-75ba-459b-a0cf-abb17eb58529.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ef01492a-fdf4-4f12-85e2-a4b67f0109c9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0e7bc6bc-2e5a-48f6-91b3-73a14859cd41.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b7cd25d4-23db-4aa7-a5c8-4ff04e4256e3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"679da531-4c64-45f2-8c1e-c917afc251f9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"6eae684f-affa-4ee6-85a7-2cf0e0bb575a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d6cb5d9e-6fba-4ddc-a611-b7a46821a3cc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Summer Carnival '92: Alzadick","Overview":"Alzadick is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up designed for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1992, a game competition similar to Hudson's Caravan Tournament.

The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one.

Joint forces have taken the motion for a special a action (irregular combat) and have prepared a mobile weapon \"BROWNING\", to destroy the ultimate weapon....according to the official blurb that is.\n\nBrowning is a side scrolling action game that puts the player in a power suit and pits them against hordes of miscellaneous mecha with some very big guns. You walk and shoot, run and shoot and also fly and shoot, although flight time is limited due to the useless engineers failing to fit a large enough fan in your jetpack.

Worse yet, most of them have the boss waiting just a few steps away from the starting point!\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the game is hard, but for the wrong reasons. Just the simple act of turning around requires a double tap of the directional button, and if you wanna run in that direction, well...let’s just say you are going to take a hit most likely. Worse, your “shield” can be fully depleted in two hits, it recharges slowly and once you lose it it’s gone and one single hit will make you explode, and force you to restart the stage with a “continue” (I don’t know if there is a limit to the continues in the game). And the rockets\/jets that can make you fly real fast, even backwards, overheat constantly, so they’re not gonna be much help either. The game also does not feature any speedups or power ups\/different weapon types that I know of.\n\nOverall, your worst enemy in the game will be the time limit. The first level boss can be completely destroyed by just ducking and shooting at it, but the last two levels have the tendency to have more then one boss. It’s especially heinous in Stage 4, where I pretty much had to resort to using a cheap trick and being lucky enough to fly over all the enemies in the level up to the boss without shooting them or getting hit once, and even then I had just 12 seconds to spare when I beat the two boss robots that come out once you beat the first one. Level 5 is a little less aggravating, but still, on my first try I blew the boss up 2 seconds before the end of the time limit, and before the game took note of the fact, I blew up (for some reason your employers blow you up if you don’t finish your task exactly as planned...sheesh, talk about punctuality). This is due to the fact that the final boss’s first weak points (the hands) only take damage when they feel like it. Most of the time you will just shoot at them and nothing will happen and then randomly they will start blinking when hit by your bullets for some reason. I still have no idea what that was about.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"123441":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Fatal Fury Special","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"fecef968-cb3f-4eb7-819a-04d0dfafde34.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fe8acc67-c2a8-4381-b3f5-c7fa1d8ba31f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ec38fad9-341b-45a9-8231-b0679c7ee959.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"56950492-2b09-499b-8ba7-a613c0010842.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3269da3c-6a22-47eb-8b5c-80565bc8e13a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"9821d03b-197f-4284-9ca2-34079cccad3e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee49980b-f17d-44ca-b9c8-47e975fc1b5a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fb693e4b-4dcb-456d-9dce-12049b6e9c51.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"99c2ad31-51f2-4e19-a93e-8a27d9966307.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d9dc16d1-df5b-40a2-b86f-14e30db4722f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Garou Densetsu: Special","Overview":"Fatal Fury Special is an improved version of SNK's 2D one-on-one fighter Fatal Fury 2.

One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...\n\nBlood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard \"RPG-like\" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. \n\nThe player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and\/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.\n\nEach time an enemy is defeated, the player is rewarded points. There is no separation between money and experience points in this game; the same kind of points is used to buy items, repair and upgrade the Powered Gear. In factories, the player can choose to upgrade the Powered Gear in one of the three categories: body, arms, and legs. Each of these categories has three sub-categories of its own, influencing speed, strength, and other parameters of the body part. Each upgrade cost a certain amount of points; it can also be reversed, and the points invested in another upgrade.\n\nTo make \"power leveling\" possible, enemies re-spawn whenever the player-controlled Powered Gear enters an area, and sometimes even if he walks off the screen and comes back.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-28T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oxGeMM6UFec&ab_channel=sunteam"},"127226":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mutech","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"cdf9e8c4-8b11-4f2a-a53d-44a68ff852d9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"87aa8b65-f6bc-477c-af42-d55ad266c816.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d9d9778c-6c85-4486-bdbd-4231cee6be7c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"40ea9303-16b9-4ad7-9333-d99071920828.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"84ca2999-da58-4c9b-92e4-3e05f3e6065b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"YaWaRa! 2: A Fashionable Judo Girl!","Overview":"In this sequel, the story concentrates far more on Fujiko - another judo wannabe, and you play the game from her point of view rather than photographer Matsuda's.

Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.","Publisher":"Sofix Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=J7tukIGyyJM&ab_channel=NerdNoiseRadio"},"127245":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kaneko","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"d9bf6146-8ff4-4117-ba3b-9bc896a14c1d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d52e262b-86cf-48df-8f8a-bab7fd57bc4a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d9d7587-64b4-4943-a0f5-1ab6b45661d1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f21f8939-c1e3-49d4-8dd7-9f5f00171e0a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"56d65f2b-59e4-4319-9355-017a46b457cc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5c9c986b-fcb1-4681-9f30-c678846aef1f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Summer Carnival '93: Nexzr Special","Overview":"Released specifically for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1993, Nexzr Special is a collection of short stages and modes that share their basic gameplay system and visuals with Nexzr. The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The \"Carnival Mode\" contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3inz3bB7bQk&ab_channel=fendfan"},"127256":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Shin-Nihon Laser Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"a1662f5a-74f6-40ee-a6c9-958e05f933e7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fc0bf16a-fb11-40e9-823d-c8a9afabc20b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d2597a0a-f332-43bb-a3db-a143dd13067b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef1d0928-c1d8-4016-9f6a-a1bdcaec9240.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"91ed6562-06b7-4cb5-9ce2-568ee68e5355.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8dfdc553-9b78-4620-8d80-a48af77fee9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b7ee4aea-4749-419e-a608-1586b4ffa563.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a7280b6b-2c15-40d2-bbe1-e31895ca0855.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Babel","Overview":"In the distant future, human beings invented space warps, which allowed space travel to long distances. On board the space ship Agamemnon, they started an intergalactic journey. But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment...\n\nBabel is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=99bsq9FIjNE&ab_channel=Japaneseretrogames"},"128053":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"3x3 Eyes Sanjiyan Henjyo","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"3x3 Eyes: Sanjiyan Henjou","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"3x3 Eyes: Sanjiyan Henjou","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"3x3 Eyes: Sanjian Hensei","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Create","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"95b731c8-abef-4933-a473-4b4bdbf1a093.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b515258d-0268-41e1-bea7-92f5cde860e7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd2e7b11-b660-44bb-8ff6-d0ec2ecfc9e3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26de1411-d006-46a2-b629-5843057852cf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a78c46a1-6af2-41df-9c10-907d510c692d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dde66b24-af33-4f4d-a3b6-36434e56c281.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05dacc06-d71d-4eb0-ad95-43d6b9859534.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e9bb246a-2b5f-4d0e-8e50-1759ed6c0e9a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b5c20b81-5cbc-4789-977c-ff4c4a98dd1f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"3×3 Eyes Sanjiyan Henjyo","Overview":"Sanjiyan Henjō is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes.

Player-controlled mechas and vehicles come in different types: some are strong but have limited maneuverability, others have a wide movement range but weak armor, etc. Battles are shown on a separate screen and proceed automatically, both sides exchanging an attack.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6_z1QeGym0s"},"131864":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"6527311c-de3b-42a0-9ef8-4b29534fb0a0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f017330e-532b-43db-be5c-4c3bf2e29af0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hyper Wars","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-05-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"131867":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Dennou Tenshi: Digital Ange","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Dennou Tenshi: Digital Angel","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tokuma Shoten Intermedia","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3c577690-e5e0-46f7-9641-b8810ed8f7f9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"17ff7dc9-961d-49e4-be29-486ef3c29495.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Denno Tenshi: Digital Angel","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten Intermedia Inc","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"131868":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cosmic Fantasy 4: Ginga Shounen Densetsu: Totsunyuu-hen"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"20f24e75-c244-4943-be17-9338698e7dca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cosmic Fantasy 4: Ginga Shounen Densetsu Totsunyuu Hen","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"131869":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cosmic Fantasy 4: Ginga Shounen Densetsu: Gekitou-hen"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"dcc3f437-7e1b-450f-9148-a5528373adcd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cosmic Fantasy 4: Ginga Shounen Densetsu Gekitou Hen","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132239":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Travel Epuru","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Riot,Telenet","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0c5cbce6-7772-4d88-8c8b-87a3570e7e43.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"048c1cd9-7c44-40e1-9be2-21bd5b691848.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5475de17-0a50-4244-ba12-9502a6fe4888.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0ee2ffee-afb6-4728-ac6b-8fb73582a29e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cd403548-526d-46d5-abb9-9108c140604e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40ca04f8-41d3-4771-9918-bd705b2cb544.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Travel Eple","Overview":"Travel Apple is a cute puzzle\/action game by Telenet and is somehow inspired by other Battle Games including Hudson Soft's famous Bomberman.

Battle fields are also filled with special blocks and tiles, like traps, teleporters or green reviving pools.

The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.\n\nThe gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132338":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kogado Software","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"fb2e9073-7eb9-4ee1-8811-03a3b6bb40d0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2678cb4f-889f-445d-945c-c62ac1fd14da.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ddc0e9bc-9f5d-475e-9ac0-2fbdc5b9a91b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Schwarzschild 2","Overview":"The follow-up to Super Schwarzschild offers an original scenario that takes place after the Great Somari War. Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.\n\nLike the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132340":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Chris's Adventure","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Hiho Densetsu Chris no Bouken"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3f5b91d9-762b-4bca-95e6-9cf5230b3d90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e0f37e6-3a43-4c9b-8b14-482b52aa8eba.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"abc23bf0-a5a4-462e-ab13-4ac7bd5a2172.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5de81588-5821-4fb4-9562-7e0140ab4886.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"47b27424-f236-4cc5-89c9-a8f263c1a534.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"12c5f400-6754-4449-a60e-d0211c48e158.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hihou Densetsu: Chris no Bouken","Overview":"Hihou Densetsu Chris no Bouken is an Action game, developed by Arc System Works and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132341":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Lodoss Tou Senki II","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"81b9b86a-9569-43e2-94f6-d7d5d7ec24f6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efd0fb30-1ed2-4c4b-823c-dd9f97d58e1f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b2c63d86-61d2-483c-8161-04e595979fd8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Record of Lodoss War II","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132342":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Kakutou Hao Densetsu Algunos"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fill-in-Cafe","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"20035891-be61-478c-a358-3de53443069b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fd44a0b1-e881-46e2-961d-1cf82a6e4f90.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e97ae31a-1e01-418d-a137-35a764287f32.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2cb5140c-12a6-40c3-9304-ae8c7a485199.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0025a860-b3f1-4498-824a-7083ac84cdc6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"15b5d7ab-a7b7-41a2-92d3-f09a3703b042.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kakutou Haou Densetsu Algunos","Overview":"Algunos is a traditional fighting game by Fill-In-Cafe.

The game counts ten different fighters : Jenius, Asasin, Arcer, Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. Every single one of them has different attacks and set of techniques the player has to learn and master. Controls are fairly simple and straight forward - one button executes a short attack and the other a long attack. If both bottons are pressed, the fighter grabs and throws his enemy in the air. Most of the fighters in Algunos use their bare hands but some also use weapons like swords (which was quite an unusual feature back when the game was published).","Publisher":"Intec","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132343":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"5a43cc79-13d2-483e-aa7d-c20930365abe.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f08e5167-503e-4be3-b7f9-ea2b0daf1578.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Moonlight Lady","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132344":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"65f9c710-8e2f-4208-9b06-d53629abbb88.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Magicoal","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132714":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Tengai Makyou II: Manji Maru","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Entertainment","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e6793d09-5fcb-4a70-8db2-25629955323d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"239706a7-7037-4d4b-9aeb-56e483fd2bb8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88ce0198-f5f1-499a-b024-1f2ef65b854e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ca245d6a-10a5-454d-8705-85bd147e86b1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"24207457-6ba9-4132-bdee-c137587b54e4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Far East of Eden: Tengai Makyou II: Manji Maru","Overview":"Tengai Makyou II: Manji Maru is a Role-Playing game, developed by RED Entertainment and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hhbqY_ojSMs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tengai_Maky%C5%8D_II:_Manji_Maru"},"132989":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bakushou Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"583dec3e-1a50-42d0-a1e9-73b334082bae.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5ee40132-74b1-4fef-a54f-7cf2168a624c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ca1dd84d-0b9b-4dbf-b1ca-e901f2951d3f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7fe756e-b1ac-498f-aea7-ea993c0ae21d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8d1c7f0e-2ec2-4fac-84bf-3ba187c70251.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4cd0adde-0de3-44e3-8265-0b4b9e2ca50e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3792d1cb-4935-4444-ad29-9299bc0b43c3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bakushou Yoshimoto Shinkigeki","Overview":"The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings.

The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.\n\nDamage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.\n\nOver the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, \"boxing glove\" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hCwkpZyah6o"},"132994":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Now Production Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a41c2e9a-e391-4462-bd6d-6f544a5519c6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4c170e97-ded2-4e3b-b473-665374f2f311.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"340989f0-554e-43df-b246-8375d74a8a60.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b97d7090-f6ea-4414-8ac0-55f8f55b7134.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"982fc164-cbf9-400c-a371-5332bbee659a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d694c2f5-dc98-4afd-b419-38b3ea643c9f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d4174411-de1e-4963-82fb-54a3675d6f9b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7319f24-82b8-402f-9e05-957678e34b15.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a611650-b206-4b55-aa5b-6759c0d3a574.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Doraemon: Nobita no Dorabian Night","Overview":"Based on the popular Doraemon franchise, Nobita no Dorabian Night follows the adventures of the titular robotic cat, as he tries to rescue his friends from different time periods.

Power-ups are obtained by flying over treasure chests, usually placed on top of the screen. These grant the hero wingmen, additional shots, a new ray attack, extra lives, etc. Like in most scrolling shooters, a button is assigned to a powerful all-screen attack (in this case throwing coins) with limited charges.

The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. \n\nThe screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.\n\nThough shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.\n\nAs the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more \"mainstream\" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133076":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Human Entertainment","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"dae06186-1080-4f80-bf77-5739c32045ef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ba5994b1-6503-46ee-97aa-ec719ef69394.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c94fddef-8b7b-46a7-81ee-cd1e45315994.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1175c1a3-81fb-4850-a3a7-2bc398abb332.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"52f63bb6-d2ee-4d31-9ed5-ae75f0694a42.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a8a11e94-b5b7-46f3-b75e-0d36b1c78188.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6f9edac9-34d4-4f7f-93e6-2f7b642763df.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"25eac9dd-2888-4331-ae09-9c45183a01b1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dc9ed908-bca8-4f35-bec7-f52a64762ecb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"05b312b8-ee7c-4441-baea-d59938178666.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"98d6c46d-d26f-4d75-af36-ed1620660513.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a31b6de7-3862-41ee-b55c-99516702f5af.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Human Sports Festival","Overview":"Human Sports Festival is a compilation that contains three previously unreleased sports games:\n\nFine Shot Golf is a golf game for up to four players with an exhibition, tournament, and practice mode.

The fighting scheme resembles that of Yie Ar Kung Fu, though with a simplified handling of high, medium, and low attacks. Some of the characters use weapons in battles; it is possible to knock these weapons out of their hands and use them against their owners.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Martial_Champion"},"133089":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"74114b56-f428-4354-8a99-dbabbd524455.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"12c9356d-5300-410b-9bb4-fa6c1bbd32fa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6bee13d0-8bdc-4d36-8b34-d4d5775d3d63.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0993be4d-5414-4cfa-80df-f962ae0ecc3e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8bc16ee6-dfaa-413a-ac7f-8dd6a896d256.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ac677200-4094-4e59-b76b-6a84b60745ea.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"89eabacb-b15b-48fc-9a17-401bc11f80ee.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d940cbfd-763c-4d51-a03c-4f5882376cd3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Minesweeper","Overview":"Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.\n\nThree main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.\n\nA second mode is a mission mode (\"voyage mode\" in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.\n\nThe Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled \"Cook's Quest\", in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133091":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"6692446b-f67e-4885-bee7-d196e4e36c9d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"72f07990-8b28-41c8-8a76-182f37f7aede.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"762c2621-9bd2-41ce-af0e-5e0b6c165b9e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bc651043-8a92-4ff3-afd4-57e5f526a40f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"00e92237-9e60-4967-9a04-ada3a971a522.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7ca2bae4-2514-4bd9-937b-39ac52ce611f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8d9ce4f2-2460-4c49-8585-521ca1a5d64a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Mystic Formula","Overview":"In a world where advanced technology and magic co-exist, the Magic Empire controls the vast arid wastelands and the dwellings of mythical creatures.

All the characters use ranged attacks that can be upgraded with power-ups.

They also appear in the \"omake mode\", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Invaders"},"133105":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"M.N.M Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"853dd24c-87f3-45ef-94c8-f853b2d41ea8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6f8e7770-f1d7-4124-b8ad-917e20936f44.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"71a36e3c-665c-4175-9ee3-957954921343.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"488edae6-4ee4-4ab0-8f93-478e68040adb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b3d6970f-590d-42a3-b766-67b8b46251d4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"35eaba5f-ce35-4fb4-b627-a05995eb2b3a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"f7a3b989-6ab4-44ee-9e8d-af8a33a546c2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5e015a2c-5b0f-4a59-b850-0c2d9b4bc84f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Mobile","Overview":"Star Mobile is a real-time puzzle game.

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. \n\nFour historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.\n\nThe game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called \"tactics\" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.\n\nStages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"133112":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"71dfe0b8-1010-4e87-9f11-0c2026fd48ac.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2948b6b8-df66-412e-98ee-11805b1ec143.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"644ce99c-4c09-4778-b1a7-d154546d39d5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3fe34f9e-c5e4-4f7c-a082-246880988d12.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d8f8f38d-41a0-44ef-9e10-bf24f9fc183b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ce4c39d6-0bbb-4e93-98bd-5296fd8abd83.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a5603f30-2df5-4963-a8a8-e72fe28afe8a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"The TV Show","Overview":"The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept.

The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability.

One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse... The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emerald_Dragon"},"140906":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Tengai Makyou: Ziria","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Entertainment","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"aafac2b2-78d3-4028-b898-196dcdb676d8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c89cf315-d933-49b0-a379-36f0605104e3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7c19920-db55-4d91-8be5-5d31a37fb639.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bccba561-06d7-44d5-8eb2-349a6e3fc8fd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"133db4e4-ca6a-43dc-a9e4-5a4fd9abff35.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d563ab5c-c97e-4e8e-b0d2-794b43c33e55.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Far East of Eden: Tengai Makyou: Ziria","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1989-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tengai_Makyou:_Ziria"},"140910":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Tengai Makyou: Fuun Kabuki Den","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Entertainment","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"666120bf-fcb7-4651-b72b-86b9f4faf149.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bd5045b2-a10e-4969-b50e-b5839c2a30a7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"57c96e55-03e4-4d1f-8bf9-bc876ef92ae0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a8e290f9-155a-4b1e-aaf2-291db04128a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d396ad9f-0f39-4bb3-9e59-6bbc3fcbffde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Far East of Eden: Tengai Makyou: Fuun Kabuki-den","Overview":"Tengai Makyou: Fuun Kabuki Den is a turn-based RPG developed by RED Company that stars Kabuki Danjirou, one of the four heroes from Tengai Makyou II.

The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world.\n\nAlnam no Kiba (\"Fang of Alnam\") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in Alshark). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XlPKnO87cX4"},"150399":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Atlas, The: Renaissance Voyager","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"The Atlas","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ArtDink","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"31f68350-1eb0-4bb3-a94f-27596b8bc925.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8bd3f872-f9c7-40d7-8383-181020442d08.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f2cecdce-4d6c-41b4-a31d-cba3b2a0f23f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c783f84-154f-44eb-b741-4a72616f38ea.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ac104791-c42d-427f-ad89-d0d07d628320.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"15e2fce0-ee1f-497f-b458-bb37eaf0c525.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8afa97bd-d3b9-462c-87d6-8ae18f0b8f88.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7a15257f-9cf7-437e-ab3b-2bfbb36d1595.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Atlas: Renaissance Voyager","Overview":"The Atlas (ジ・アトラス The Atlas) is a multiplatform strategy\/simulation video game developed by Artdink Development. The game is set during the Age of Discovery in the 15th century.\n\nThere is a strict time limit of five years to discover mysterious lands that are 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometres south of Portugal.[1] Players can work for an admiral and can either change employment or even retire. Specialized names for the adventures, along with their characteristics and every kind of information possible is synthesized by the combination of certain attributes. The topographic features are created completely by random by a method of biosynthesis.\n\nElements of war and plague affect the political stability in each of the game's regions. As the years progress in the game, trade and exploration play a role in impacting the in-game economy. Procurement, pestilence and contagious diseases are created through trade; decreasing the number of residents that reside in that particular town or city. These factors may also lead to the loss of vital trade ships. A contingent of information is used in order to enhance the illusion of being taken home. The map in the game is basically close to that of the parts of the Earth that were known in the 15th century. Encyclopedias can be found in the cities in addition to world maps and local specialties. Even animals can be found in the in-game towns. Strange life forms and primitive civilizations are randomly distributed on the map, they are described in the encyclopedia that covers the entire in-game universe. The truths that are accidentally synthesized will also players to get a mysterious world consisting of fictional things. The grotesqueness and strange phenomena can actually been seen and experienced.","Publisher":"ArtDink","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Atlas_(video_game)"},"150400":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pack-In Video","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"0964ea60-6707-4ee1-826b-7fe9b9f3aa44.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"879b7705-0a3d-4be6-96d7-69b7fb667183.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"00604cd7-251f-456d-b421-b203fc9d026f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1f0b7f1-d914-4d33-8bca-bf897614467b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"257449e0-8d0d-4ead-90c7-785d5ae05f76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"26f059ba-d092-41af-b9b1-dc026b17c504.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d547ef22-843a-4ee9-acd7-9094e398c734.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aurora Quest: Otaku no Seiza in Another World","Overview":"Foregoing the generic fantasy setting of most RPGs, Aurora Quest casts you as Otaku-chan, a man in a land controlled by a group of five women called Aurora (who would pass quite easily for a Japanese girlie band).

But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.\n\nThe game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime\/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.\n\nThe gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.","Publisher":"Human Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"154169":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bakuretsu Hunter","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Media Works Inc.","Images":[{"FileName":"141c3289-58c2-4712-ab9e-436e1aa1b98b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9f7607df-a8d2-46c9-8a7b-a141ef84db61.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a0c4e001-36ac-4a6b-842b-3d2d2ed4d912.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"990a3e8a-4b89-4260-bb59-30568cedf84a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Duo Comic: Bakuretsu Hunter","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"154171":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fujicom Co.

Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.","Publisher":"Fujicom Co.

Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level. \n\nThe DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses.\n\nAlso included on the CD is a timed mode (\"Caravan Mode\") of Implode, as well as the puzzle game Loop, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.","Publisher":"MindRec","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2004,"WikipediaURL":"http:\/\/www.pcengine.co.uk\/HTML_Homebrew\/Meteor_Blaster.htm"},"156642":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NHK","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"5d910ac1-fb6c-40be-8270-9eef629bf936.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d5448497-b9f9-43c5-b117-da48cc8a901a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"016f9565-e7aa-42c1-ac14-3e4287af77b4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0aa78d85-48e5-4829-898b-bd9eabe8b217.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Akiyama Jin no Suugaku Mystery: Hihou India no Honou wo Shishu Seyo","Publisher":"NHK Enterprises","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156645":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pandora Box","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"54127d75-65ab-445c-a791-7689ca276609.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4facda69-af42-45bc-ba6c-e3877f29d51d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Burai: Hachigyoku no Yuushi Densetsu","Overview":"The world of Kypros is populated by many races: humans, intelligent reptiles, dog-like wosshus, and others. There are also many gods in Kypros. Not all the gods could accept the peaceful co-existence of creatures in Kypros, and Daar, the god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was defeated and sealed by the god of light, Risk. Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is trying to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient prophecy, only eight heroes, the bearers of magic pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes who come from different parts of Kypros, unaware of their great mission. Among those heroes are the young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu tribe Gonza and his little sister Maimai, the beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others.\n\nBefore the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective. Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his\/her own unique techniques to use in battles.\n\nThe story and general gameplay of Burai: Hachigyoku no Yūshi Densetsu is similar to those of the original Burai: Jōkan for computers; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cutscenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.","Publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"156647":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"King Records","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"dc7901ad-559c-45a6-9846-ab4cae2bc813.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fe85e27a-49c9-4288-b166-cd2768fe5ed3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"23b84cd0-b77b-4082-bfdf-e8ef6462a2f5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e1abbfb0-22ab-475d-a751-13f9a6e3872f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"CD Battle: Hikari no Yuushatachi","Publisher":"King Records","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156649":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Game Express","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"2656d126-26b0-473b-9e09-9900fa4c7b57.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"da38e5af-f644-4b7a-9f60-7784d23917c0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"019a5188-a2b4-4cb9-bd96-908aae21091a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"CD Bishoujo Pachinko Kyuuma Yon Shimai","Overview":"Kyūma Yon Shimai is a pachinko slot machine gambling game.

The \"RPG mode\" follows the story of an apprentice \"mahjong warrior\", a girl named Chi Fou, who is sent on a quest to defeat monsters that were unleashed on the world. This mode is structured like a traditional medieval top-down RPG, with town and dungeon exploration, NPC interaction, and other familiar elements. The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and purchase healing and status-recovering items. Experience points and money are awarded after each battle.\n\nRandom and boss battles in this mode are standard mahjong games, with the addition of special tiles that influence the game's result, e.g. increase the damage inflicted by the equipped weapon. The final damage is calculated after the mahjong game is over, and depends on the characters' levels, equipment, and the winning combination. For example, winning the game with a full mahjong would most likely result in a \"critical hit\". Boss enemies typically take two or more rounds of mahjong to defeat.\n\nIn addition, the game features a versus mode, which allows the player to compete in mahjong games against the opponents of the RPG mode, with weapons, equipment, and level parameters playing no role. These opponents appear as monsters at first, but are revealed to be pretty young women who remove parts of their clothes when losing a mahjong round; stripping down to underwear equals defeat. Despite this feature, there is no explicit nudity in the game.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156711":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A.I Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"13d916ef-4423-45a7-8c9e-6193ad4b1800.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jantei Monogatari","Overview":"A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yū Honjō, has been kidnapped by someone unknown.

The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects.

The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective.

Miraculously, the three are teleported into a parallel dimension, and the reluctant hero discovers, to his amazement, that its inhabitants seem to be familiar with him.\n\nThe game plays like a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a menu of verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and Move) at nearly every screen, some leading to object lists. It is often necessary to go through the commands several times to unlock a new one or trigger events.

As opposed to the previous game, where Shoma was the protagonist, Yohko is the player character in the sequel.\n\nGameplay-wise, the puzzle-less Japanese adventure format is further utilized.

Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...\n\nLa Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.\n\nHowever, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong\/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.\n\nThe entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no \"world map\", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on \"level-grinding\"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156743":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SystemSoft","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"2ea77066-62ab-48fc-aeb2-043f2b8a375d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cb02566e-5834-4dca-ab40-6dc33ee21b85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ab50d884-129c-4b54-a0af-d9edd1f2ed06.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Master of Monsters","Overview":"Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.\n\nYour aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156744":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Multimedia Intelligence Transfer","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"aefc0704-cb7b-4b94-9124-1fdb643ad51d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"52b63c85-baeb-4888-8f9a-6f90710dfa94.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9c300b04-3b03-4a58-8278-7d56b97fdb0a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mateki Densetsu Astralius","Overview":"It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians.

Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world!\n\nDespite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an \"old-school\" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called \"performing\" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.\n\nUnlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.","Publisher":"IGS (Japan)","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156745":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Megami Tengoku","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A.I Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e3720f0d-3dc6-4683-bbce-786ce2da23ae.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"af06e553-d44e-41f3-ab13-8b588d9e566a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4f7cb4c-bead-47fc-b629-f83dcf32ee51.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cdd7063c-8539-4c07-8fe5-8a58fbb332fa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Megami Paradise","Overview":"In a magical country where only women dwell, young girls study in a magic school to become powerful and benevolent goddesses.

As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and\/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.\n\nUnlike most other Ranma 1\/2 iterations, this game is a so-called \"digital comic\", which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.","Publisher":"Masaya","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156805":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"ROM^2 Karaoke Volume 1"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NEC Avenue","Genres":"Music; Party","Images":[{"FileName":"46a3ded5-561e-48d9-a016-7610e5db62cf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"da5c65f1-2dee-472f-b3dd-e757c96319e9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2d73daa5-32f3-4c8b-8017-a780c9563a9a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Rom Rom Karaoke: Volume 1","Overview":"ROM² Karaoke: Volume 1 is the first in the series of karaoke discs by NEC Avenue.

But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.\n\nSeiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this \"baby action\", the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).\n\nInstead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.). The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective.

Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.\n\nEach town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy.

No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure.

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156840":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Sotsugyou II - Neo Generation","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Headroom","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"a0c14ac0-5149-4b12-806e-0e3d47425dce.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ccdf0b1b-51ee-4116-b351-65e864234ec7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"14ba6c9d-faba-4916-bb98-3862183f8895.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sotsugyou 2: Neo Generation","Overview":"Graduation is a Japanese anime \"life-sim\" game.

The computer versions also feature an editor.\n\nThe game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types.

The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.\n\nDifferent units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles.

The game is set in a medieval fantasy land populated by various races; when the country is overrun by demonic invaders, the king cowardly avoids responsibility and puts the task of liberating it into the hands of a group of heroes. Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.\n\nNavigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.\n\nFields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like perspective.

Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion.

Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc.\n\nBattles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"156885":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"ROM^2 Karaoke Vol. 1: Suteki ni Standard"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Victor Musical Industries","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"392531af-8655-4061-b360-5d3caece0410.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3aae7c11-6383-4fc9-8851-055095566137.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c61757ad-164d-4882-9e52-febb5b2dbaa8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Rom Rom Karaoke: Volume 1: Suteki ni Standard","Overview":"ROM² Karaoke Vol. 1: Suteki ni Standard is the first in the series of karaoke discs by Victor Musical Industries.

Neo Kenya is the name of a world that is in danger of being completely annihilated by an asteroid. The armies of Neo Kenya have searched for every conceivably way to prevent the coming catastrophe. When the inhabitants of the world turn to a dark god, their prayers and nightmares come true. The game was originally released for the PC-Engine in 1995 under the title of Linda³. Players start the game off with two characters, Linda and Ken.\n\nThe story in the game is portrayed through a series of cutscenes, which for the most part are voiced. Action in the game is split up by events that show the deplorable nature of the characters in the face of impending doom.\n\nThree gameplay modes are offered at the beginning, and differ in difficulty and focus.\n\nCapturing monsters is the device used to advanced the plot. The combat in the game plays out similar to Dragon Quest. The combat is represented via text with sprites on the screen representing the enemies. As players capture different monsters, they can use them to give Linda and Ken new abilities and advance the plot. As players wander around the world collecting creatures the time in the game advances in real time. Players only have a set number of gameplay hours to bring as many creatures as possible back to the ship, or Ken and Linda will be left to die on the planet as everyone else evacuates.\n\nThe game's story combines psychological elements with voodoo and the occult. The two main characters in the game are Ken, an army soldier tasked with the job of catching monsters; and his girlfriend Linda, who is used by the military as a surrogate for the god's plans. The inhabitants of the Neo Kenya called upon a god by the name of Anubis (a reference to the Egyptian lord of the underworld) in order to protect them from imminent destruction. Apparently answering their calls, the dark god sent an Ark similar to Noah's Ark. He demands that a man and a woman gather two of every animal on the planet. The army nominated Ken and Linda to achieve this task.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"163572":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Sangokushi III","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"cf6f3e5c-9ca5-42fc-8438-2690601b3659.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7f4b912b-f4a4-44eb-b63b-0fffb27ae49b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b6d3eacf-3955-40a5-aee0-0e7d76c644ba.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"10c5297f-36c6-4e1f-a5b6-bf9aa9a320b4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Romance of the Three Kingdoms III: Dragon of Destiny","Overview":"Romance of the Three Kingdoms III, or Sangokushi III to give it its Japanese name, is the third game in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series of historical strategy\/simulation games based on the Three Kingdoms era.
