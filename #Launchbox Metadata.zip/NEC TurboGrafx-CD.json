{"Name":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","Games":[{"DatabaseID":105951,"Name":"1552 Tenka Tairan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game (with MOUSE support!) set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called gekokujou situation, when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his/her own character. Character creation is Ultima-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.\n\nThe gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and maneuvering the troops.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiY__0DbEu4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"ASK Kodansha","Publisher":"ASK Kodansha","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"b14e6bf1-52af-4ec0-a082-e48d87482398.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"abd26c06-527c-4aa2-bd6b-dfc222b62dd7.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"ef0ee7cf-2b2f-494a-a2cf-b8ffb358ff0a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"b46fef6f-c3f8-4f56-9cd0-5aa966b3718d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"b54f5e2c-8ab5-4cbe-a580-20b5af73a6cc.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"d258e222-762e-4506-8746-795d4f41025a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"53e11cde-fe4b-4f71-af90-e1349d33e54b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105951,"FileName":"c22e8b86-acda-4b04-806b-064c4f462e7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128053,"Name":"3×3 Eyes Sanjiyan Henjyo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sanjiyan Henjō is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes.

The dark priest Shaft has kidnapped Annette Renard, Richter's main love interest, and taken her to Castlevania along with a handful of other female victims.

Along the way you may collect hearts from candles to power one of 6 different subweapons; the dagger, holy water, axe, cross, grimoire, and stopwatch. Each subweapon has a specific style of use and special \"Item Crash\" attack, which allows for an expensive but devastating super attack.\n\nNumerous hidden secrets may be found during the adventure, opening up pathways to new stages or leading to one of the four victims to rescue; one of which becomes a playable character after being freed. The victims Richter is able to rescue will affect which of the multiple endings you will see.

The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlPKnO87cX4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"f315a723-2b9a-484d-91bf-c728b23d32a2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"fe783070-ec00-4b99-a1d0-75c871232882.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"f6a4eb32-4841-40fe-bfbf-5603365872e6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"a4872ebb-79e4-4828-a84b-1fa0aa99791f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"48783936-ec68-44ee-98b6-d7a507099c20.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"f409c326-51f8-458d-a78e-134133db6fd1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"ecee68b0-01b4-4ef1-9cc7-994e853cbb49.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150398,"FileName":"958cb1c6-15c9-45a4-913f-03590ecb3d38.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":150398,"AlternateName":"Arunamu no Kiba: Juuzoku Juuni Shinto Densetsu","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150398,"AlternateName":"ARUNAMU NO KIBA  FANG OF ALNAM : JUZOKU JUNI SHINTO DENSETSU","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":105953,"Name":"Alshark","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wisperad is a small universe that consists of only a few star systems. Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.\n\nA young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercraft. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.\n\nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks, whereas the TurboGrafx CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","Publisher":"Victor Entertainment Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"05855cd0-99f9-4787-a5df-c187d9dc149f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"d0a67526-453a-498b-bad0-65e287612eba.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"8e0ebe3f-09b5-49c3-95d1-868141feec88.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"14073696-b336-431d-8283-6aff77141666.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"ed071f85-32b3-40ca-8532-f275052e2b67.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"3a6c2dd8-77ca-485c-8a93-d4b87efe5996.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"79408ef4-766a-48e7-8af5-b30d79dbe11a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105953,"FileName":"bf778c96-563d-442d-87df-9def0d64f6ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":35197,"Name":"Ane-san","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The two sisters, Ai and Yuuko, have taken different paths in life.

If the diaper becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, the player immediately loses a life, so collecting fresh bottles and diapers is important.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBaT2wWDcQg","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Loriciel SA","Publisher":"Loriciel SA","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"193b0014-4b7b-45f6-bf47-0ec62a10360a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"c0ac65c9-5fab-4a5d-9bfe-f0ca1d8da3b3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"5b3048c1-dada-47e2-a32b-99d156e912dc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"3b986bda-6977-42f8-bea0-a746f8ca92c4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"ba85283d-1401-4e78-9a89-44ebd5b58882.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"1cc71913-8b58-4f93-a7e7-df3829ededd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"1f26576a-b008-4c68-b8f5-00272100fedf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125087,"FileName":"58176e33-5f3e-4246-85e9-8c617f442188.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154172,"Name":"Bakuden: Unbalance Zone","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Sony Music Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":154172,"FileName":"c80d2704-6d7c-430a-aba5-646e8234d4c2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":154172,"AlternateName":"Bakuden Unbalance Zone","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":132989,"Name":"Bakushou Yoshimoto Shinkigeki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings.

One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...\n\nBlood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard \"RPG-like\" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. \n\nThe player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.\n\nEach time an enemy is defeated, the player is rewarded points. There is no separation between money and experience points in this game; the same kind of points is used to buy items, repair and upgrade the Powered Gear.

It is evident that they are developing the most evil weapon for slaughter to maintain and grasp its superiority of military power in the world. Joint forces have taken the motion for a special a action (irregular combat) and have prepared a mobile weapon \"BROWNING\", to destroy the ultimate weapon....according to the official blurb that is.\n\nBrowning is a side scrolling action game that puts the player in a power suit and pits them against hordes of miscellaneous mecha with some very big guns. You walk and shoot, run and shoot and also fly and shoot, although flight time is limited due to the useless engineers failing to fit a large enough fan in your jetpack. After ploughing through a few screens of nasties, you are presented with a particularly unfriendly boss mecha who seems intent on aggressive negotiations. After quickly dispatching said boss, you are free to move on to the next level and do it all over again!\n\nYou say... \nBrowning isn’t apparently well liked in the gaming community. I have no idea about the background of this game but what I do imagine is that a lot of people might feel ripped off.\n\nThe game sports maybe five generic enemies, and is only five levels long. Worse yet, most of them have the boss waiting just a few steps away from the starting point!\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the game is hard, but for the wrong reasons. Just the simple act of turning around requires a double tap of the directional button, and if you wanna run in that direction, well...let’s just say you are going to take a hit most likely. Worse, your “shield” can be fully depleted in two hits, it recharges slowly and once you lose it it’s gone and one single hit will make you explode, and force you to restart the stage with a “continue” (I don’t know if there is a limit to the continues in the game). And the rockets/jets that can make you fly real fast, even backwards, overheat constantly, so they’re not gonna be much help either. The game also does not feature any speedups or power ups/different weapon types that I know of.\n\nOverall, your worst enemy in the game will be the time limit. The first level boss can be completely destroyed by just ducking and shooting at it, but the last two levels have the tendency to have more then one boss. It’s especially heinous in Stage 4, where I pretty much had to resort to using a cheap trick and being lucky enough to fly over all the enemies in the level up to the boss without shooting them or getting hit once, and even then I had just 12 seconds to spare when I beat the two boss robots that come out once you beat the first one. Level 5 is a little less aggravating, but still, on my first try I blew the boss up 2 seconds before the end of the time limit, and before the game took note of the fact, I blew up (for some reason your employers blow you up if you don’t finish your task exactly as planned...sheesh, talk about punctuality). This is due to the fact that the final boss’s first weak points (the hands) only take damage when they feel like it. Most of the time you will just shoot at them and nothing will happen and then randomly they will start blinking when hit by your bullets for some reason. I still have no idea what that was about.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Riot Games","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"49a13439-9be8-433a-9453-42724134f069.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"44d29a25-a76b-485f-a6e4-4ad26de95798.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"dc932336-e9a4-49c2-a892-8e4e13d50b9e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"d73986ee-e8d8-4658-8199-b5d029400da3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"43134e90-5999-45fb-91b7-9fe4befeb290.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"768ece93-9d18-4c2f-961e-fa33d2cddfc8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123060,"FileName":"3c146b10-ee7c-4214-840a-23967ff07961.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125654,"Name":"Builderland: The Story of Melba","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Another western game converted to the PC Engine by Micro World, Builderland has a concept similar to the infamous Lemmings, and requires equally sharp forethought and reactions.

There are also many gods in Kypros. Not all the gods could accept the peaceful co-existence of creatures in Kypros, and Daar, the god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was defeated and sealed by the god of light, Risk. Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is trying to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient prophecy, only eight heroes, the bearers of magic pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes who come from different parts of Kypros, unaware of their great mission. Among those heroes are the young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu tribe Gonza and his little sister Maimai, the beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others.\n\nBefore the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective. Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique techniques to use in battles.\n\nThe story and general gameplay of Burai: Hachigyoku no Yūshi Densetsu is similar to those of the original Burai: Jōkan for computers; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cutscenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Pandora Box","Publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156645,"FileName":"54127d75-65ab-445c-a791-7689ca276609.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156645,"FileName":"4facda69-af42-45bc-ba6c-e3877f29d51d.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150404,"Name":"Burai: Yatsudama no Yuushi Densetsu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Overhead fantasy role-playing game featuring random battles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Riverhillsoft","Publisher":"Pandora Box","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":150404,"FileName":"faf7cacf-4a58-4bb7-8ed5-6115645ee93f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150404,"FileName":"0c69be91-ba1b-45eb-8317-1c94ffe1a8e8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":9987,"Name":"Buster Bros.","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield.

Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be \"captured\" and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.\n\nThe story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other.

That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time.\n\nCosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: Bōken Shōnen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes.\n\nLike the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the party frequently, as dictated by the plot; the party may contain up to four active combatants. Story progression and overworld exploration is linear; dungeons are usually fairly complex and maze-like. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Telenet Japan","Publisher":"Working Designs","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"a6275ec1-2f88-4ce1-9941-1fec227a85ae.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"dcf61766-41c8-4fd1-8675-f34ad3579fef.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"2c786a77-386a-4afe-a3d2-4441c0618495.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"c78f50d1-ae35-49e5-a1a0-0111a1bd4e12.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"207aa2d7-843b-4903-9ccb-27e0f6da0431.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"bf0f810b-34b2-4cf9-8080-62836f8c231d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"10f2d7db-27fa-45e7-94b1-134a5ab1b606.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"d8c63c77-ed14-4d9d-87a6-f00a28a76353.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"054f3565-19c8-40d1-956b-bc619d966a0d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"1080153b-4674-4d2b-bb68-07886843ae90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"74bbd24f-b6a3-4ebe-947c-ea8bb69d9f9a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9988,"FileName":"2b416877-77ef-4f42-92b8-a51609f90b83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9988,"AlternateName":"Cosmic Fantasy 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":126249,"Name":"Cosmic Fantasy 3: Bouken Shounen Rei","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8KtH2ZrC1I","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Shin-Nihon Laser Soft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126249,"FileName":"a976ce3e-46eb-43f3-86a4-f228b4241d18.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126249,"FileName":"02702918-e64f-4268-b3a0-3e2388e68952.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126249,"FileName":"a6b48f64-6f42-41a9-a7e9-73f6ff2330b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126249,"FileName":"6c263b5b-2872-47b3-adf8-d54227df4ec2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131869,"Name":"Cosmic Fantasy 4: Ginga Shounen Densetsu Gekitou Hen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure;

The players takes control of a World War II plane and fights his way through a vast array of enemy air defenses such as tanks, submarines and battle ships (curiously, there aren't any enemy planes in the game). Our fighter plane can use a classic Vulcan gun and a special, but limited, bomb attack. The latter calls a formation of friendly planes that will shoot at will until they eventually get hit. Pressing the bomb button twice triggers a powerful smart-bomb and wipes out most of the enemies on screen. A standard power-up system upgrades the plane throughout the game - destroying tiny truck usually frees up power-icons.

The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.\n\nDamage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.\n\nOver the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, \"boxing glove\" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.","MaxPlayers":"5","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCwkpZyah6o","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Racing","Developer":"Renovation Game","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"de5b5316-9bd4-4c63-a925-eff01945dfe3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"a651c449-9621-4894-90a6-2be5a471f4fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"d434c43a-fe75-4af5-b4b3-d1b17902e505.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"e32ee7b7-e16a-42d2-b11c-798acb3813da.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"4423e3b3-7fd3-4eae-8a85-a7434fcb3d2a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"c5bd63a7-1bc7-489c-b917-01fd54f1b610.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":132993,"FileName":"65cafcfa-cb41-48cc-9e05-dbe717837487.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":132993,"AlternateName":"Dekoboko Densetsu: Hashiru Wagamanmaa","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":131867,"Name":"Denno Tenshi: Digital Angel","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Tokuma Shoten Intermedia","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten Intermedia Inc","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":131867,"FileName":"3c577690-e5e0-46f7-9641-b8810ed8f7f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131867,"FileName":"17ff7dc9-961d-49e4-be29-486ef3c29495.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":131867,"AlternateName":"Dennou Tenshi: Digital Ange","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":131867,"AlternateName":"Dennou Tenshi: Digital Angel","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":156661,"Name":"Develo Magazine: Volume 1","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"A disc entitled Develo Magazine Vol. 1 was included in the 1996 edition of the Super PC Engine Fan Deluxe magazine.

All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!\n\nDragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"TamTam","Publisher":"NEC Avenue","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156663,"FileName":"1158310f-b584-49b8-bf5f-81d6530588c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156663,"FileName":"c5741f1f-fe88-4277-a63d-602399441b30.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156663,"FileName":"7b16e57a-b5f4-4642-951f-a5269ea6eb17.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156663,"AlternateName":"Dragon Knight 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":142700,"Name":"Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu 2","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l17jNocHPS8","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Epoch Co.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142700,"FileName":"b6624d0f-cdf2-4d5f-a58b-9acfc9c97add.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":142700,"FileName":"49ab2a9a-9ae5-47c6-98fc-d12aac369024.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":142700,"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":5665,"Name":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this epic role-playing game, you must guide Prince Logan all accross the beautiful and dngerious world of Isrenasa in the quest to regain his throne.

One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse... The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Alfa System","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140902,"FileName":"e2a3a6f0-ff62-4a86-ab85-5b04002ea097.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140902,"FileName":"c2a98556-e205-4cc9-a14d-ad89cac98261.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174531,"Name":"Emerald Dragon Taikenban","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Special edition of emerald dragon","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Media Works Inc.","Publisher":"NEC International","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":174531,"FileName":"8d20d4d8-5c87-41ea-8031-f4fdccf5b4ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":174531,"FileName":"aaa1c73e-8f72-49ec-9fe7-fde9a2155323.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":174531,"FileName":"50f56b72-f040-42a7-a828-fac4009eb554.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":174531,"FileName":"75f7ae81-6af4-4401-8ec4-4968a0f3bc60.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":174531,"AlternateName":"Emerald Dragon Taikenban","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":9992,"Name":"Exile","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Become Sadler the desert warrior as he travels the known world in search of the precious Holimax!

The Japanese titled release is Exile II: Janen no Jishou (エグザイルII ～邪念の事象～).  The game follows the adventures of the series' protagonist, the Middle Eastern assassin. Separated from his companions in the end of the previous game, Sadler encounters a mysterious prophet who tells him a curse has fallen upon Baghdad, and the destiny of the world lies in his hands. Sadler travels to Baghdad, where he encounters old friends and old enemies, and learns about a great threat that stirs hatred and turns people into monsters.\n\nLike its predecessors, Exile: Wicked Phenomenon is an action RPG. The game is viewed from top-down perspective when exploring towns and other peaceful locations, but switches to side-scrolling view for hostile areas. The player controls one character at a time, but is able to switch between Sadler and his friends (Rumi, Kindi, and Fakhyle), whenever they travel together.

For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. \n\nThis version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town).

The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.\n\nThe Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.\n\nThe combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal \"punch-kick\" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Publisher":"Toho Co.,Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"41d44cf7-ca43-4249-80ff-3c983a79b49c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"6cd88711-f7a5-48db-9e98-2d10d4431153.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"7107ae3c-ea17-456c-b768-4ff5cd2e3e54.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"bf0c5389-dfd9-4bc4-8aa2-14152b05a9db.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"420240ae-5157-4caa-9154-be85f67b0839.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"f0cda607-9275-40de-9324-1ec29a72af2d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"c2a36a0c-a2a8-472a-a2f2-8cb1d40f9782.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"239f5e2c-d1bf-4d52-a0b5-ced95d835d12.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"732242fa-8e91-4093-9534-ffe1c8bf8b63.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"de9ad553-b52c-4c5e-bd57-8dd0ca3f6d86.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18848,"FileName":"3b2348dd-6358-4404-9f02-a339cde72566.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18848,"AlternateName":"Godzilla","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":29746,"Name":"Golden Axe","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"One of Sega's classic arcade titles, Golden Axe features three fantasy characters on their quest to destroy the evil Death Adder.

At various points (and between each level) you will encounter tiny little humanoids dressed in blue or green - the green ones drop food to increase your health bars, the blue ones drop magic potions (although you have to put the boot in to get anything from them). Each character is able to cast magic spells, and the more potions you have, the more impressive and powerful the spells are. Gilius casts lightning spells, which are the weakest, Ax casts earthquake spells and Tyris casts powerful fire spells which can be powered up to give you a giant dragon that breathes flames all over the landscape.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Telenet","Publisher":"Telenet","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"ab698be9-384f-4aa8-844b-e457f0d5c139.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"c7e89ef4-83b3-4184-b316-bbadb3321b2a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"7ceecb12-51be-4930-94e9-08d8ea42004e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"d2b57fcb-474e-44ef-8a70-617a18b16d17.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"6ebe0b82-688b-40ab-a032-39dd3c0b23d5.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"e50d3699-7d1e-48c3-8944-99a9d82dddaf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"660c5ad1-60b3-4b37-9c4a-4323cd1f6402.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"710b3ece-1228-4716-a790-bffb7d526f90.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"3230d977-0f6e-4276-ac55-19aa86b7a0eb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"1bb46037-64d4-4d11-a185-07eb19c13a7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":29746,"FileName":"f7a873fd-9543-4e3d-8b39-779d3d02deaa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123527,"Name":"Götzendiener","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A beautiful woman, captured by an evil beast - chained up in his castle and waiting for the brave knight to come and rescue her.

But the power of magic corrupted some of them. The magic users were divided into those who supported the Light and those who turned to Darkness. The balance was broken, and peace between humans and fairy creatures were no longer possible. One day, a wandering samurai is caught in a storm on a sea; washed ashore, he loses his memory. Teaming up with two other warriors, the hero meets a benevolent sorceress named Garland, who sends them on a quest to rid the land of fairy creatures who got rampant, and help her in her battle against the evil sorceress whose plan is to destroy peace forever.\n\nLike other Games Express titles, Hi-Leg Fantasy is an erotically-themed parody on a well-known game franchise - in this case, obviously the Final Fantasy series, most particularly its fifth installment. Combat, character growth, even menu design strongly remind of classic Final Fantasy games; as in those, the battles utilize the ATB (active time battle) system. The \"job\" system from Final Fantasy V is implemented here as well.\n\nThe adult element is present in the battles. Enemies are young and sexy girls, mostly fairy creatures of various kinds.

There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. \n\nThe screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.\n\nThough shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.\n\nAs the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more \"mainstream\" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Toaplan Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"3657ee11-dc56-4e03-b5ba-ee49a1ae2e4a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"7a8e11fe-17af-4133-86c5-b92dd7c2b543.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"372afea4-2efc-499f-9f18-0ca77e093f5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"0057cc64-4458-4204-9302-46328f7e819c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"04145fe4-1925-44df-9372-7b9d5e3174fa.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"506fefa4-79ee-4b2b-bfe4-66eb17f7e2fe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133000,"FileName":"26d2e321-112f-40f1-9d74-838ae612314d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156686,"Name":"Hu PGA Tour Power Golf 2: Golfer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Power Golf 2: Golfer is a follow-up to Power Golf.

The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156686,"FileName":"700aade5-7878-43a3-84d6-197374b5565f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156686,"FileName":"89525938-6d94-4b54-a1a4-0008161ccd9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156686,"FileName":"d68ed5c2-68e3-4e22-be79-be1eee1682d3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156686,"FileName":"5da3ccca-cb71-4e01-acff-a57cd5b83a3d.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156686,"AlternateName":"Hu PGA Tour: Power Golf 2: Golfer","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156686,"AlternateName":"Hu PGA Tour: PowerGolf 2: Golfer","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":174569,"Name":"Hudson's CD Game Music Collection '93","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Original CD music from various PC Engine SCD games.","MaxPlayers":"0","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Music","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":174569,"FileName":"70e52b0c-db2e-4322-b86c-ece79e73e82c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":174569,"FileName":"691a0899-c65c-4cf5-9349-29d287da8884.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133076,"Name":"Human Sports Festival","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Human Sports Festival is a compilation that contains three previously unreleased sports games:\n\nFine Shot Golf is a golf game for up to four players with an exhibition, tournament, and practice mode.

It is also possible to miss completely, with the dot wandering outside of the enemy picture.\n\nThe fishing simulation part is integrated into the RPG gameplay: in towns, the player can buy fishing accessories (rods, nets, bait, etc.); on the world map, the player can navigate the character onto a river bank and start fishing using available accessories.

On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...\n\nLaplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available.

We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Brain Grey","Publisher":"Brain Grey","ReleaseDate":"1990-08-31T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156725,"FileName":"939455d5-c30d-4afe-8246-f526673d36a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156725,"FileName":"4e9044b4-d67d-444d-bb63-3e8b7e4de333.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156725,"FileName":"c1aaadf7-de20-4ddc-aa1d-8c88e8541892.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25036,"Name":"L-Dis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"L-Dis is an Action game, developed by Dual and published by NCS, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Dual","Publisher":"NCS","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"7509bb87-33c2-454b-8a73-fc4098e8d5a8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"7caa863a-f7bc-41a2-88ce-5ae17e8815b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"6eef8f92-e2db-4e41-8362-9bc7c28dab3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"065f7e5f-6830-4b77-a3d9-82c71e827ace.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"a64964dd-9db7-44b4-b275-3c644d76950a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"e7c9bbf2-fa05-496d-a066-a0929404ec1a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":25036,"FileName":"8c448474-f813-4458-92d9-fc2730606b12.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33163,"Name":"Legend of Xanadu II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Falcom has pretty much established themselves as one of the finest RPG makers in the business, and Xanadu II - an offshoot of the Legend of Heroes series shows exactly why.

His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!\n\nThe game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to \"bump\" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.\n\nThe game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.\n\nThere is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1994-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"fa7eda1d-789a-4c30-9bdb-1556340eebfc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"72f473fe-5a0a-4283-8850-17f8d0551e94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"03536d35-5fab-4342-9987-ddc5ce84c7a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"85871fd5-be90-4ea2-b0b6-b95ef3a63e94.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"92960db3-6a2a-4896-ba97-6263e266fb32.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"ae1d5819-425b-422f-9fde-3edabfd25021.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33162,"FileName":"3e71119a-a2c7-474a-996c-a4be0efad076.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174612,"Name":"Legend of Xanadu: Kaze no Densetsu Xanadu II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=SRkaze-no-densetsu-xanadu-2-pc-engine-cd&v=eS8ML5hrJXo&feature=emb_logo","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Falcom","Publisher":"Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":174612,"FileName":"60fb2be0-2950-4744-9e04-1d210cb8302f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":174612,"FileName":"1f888963-56cc-495d-a551-a2d22ebb8ac5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":174612,"FileName":"544dceb5-ec22-44b6-89e6-8142f14f728e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133081,"Name":"Legion","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Legion is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up.

The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Kuusou Kagaku","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"5bc18bb8-6cfe-4002-b3ee-a6e8f75987d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"46391e54-494f-4edd-b5d7-ff2cabe04846.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"fc889424-3b72-4497-b4de-210376a92665.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"7ec38624-3fa0-45e3-b49e-cb8826e9197d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"24175c39-c41c-43d6-ab31-7b10725bb50f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"37c37189-85a4-47b0-9823-67439f08ebf7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18393,"FileName":"e38cacd6-60cb-423f-94a7-af258254245d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163513,"Name":"Linda³","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Linda³ Again is an esoteric JRPG that combines elements of psychological horror with monster collection. Neo Kenya is the name of a world that is in danger of being completely annihilated by an asteroid. The armies of Neo Kenya have searched for every conceivably way to prevent the coming catastrophe. When the inhabitants of the world turn to a dark god, their prayers and nightmares come true. The game was originally released for the PC-Engine in 1995 under the title of Linda³. Players start the game off with two characters, Linda and Ken.\n\nThe story in the game is portrayed through a series of cutscenes, which for the most part are voiced. Action in the game is split up by events that show the deplorable nature of the characters in the face of impending doom.\n\nThree gameplay modes are offered at the beginning, and differ in difficulty and focus.\n\nCapturing monsters is the device used to advanced the plot. The combat in the game plays out similar to Dragon Quest. The combat is represented via text with sprites on the screen representing the enemies. As players capture different monsters, they can use them to give Linda and Ken new abilities and advance the plot. As players wander around the world collecting creatures the time in the game advances in real time. Players only have a set number of gameplay hours to bring as many creatures as possible back to the ship, or Ken and Linda will be left to die on the planet as everyone else evacuates.\n\nThe game's story combines psychological elements with voodoo and the occult. The two main characters in the game are Ken, an army soldier tasked with the job of catching monsters; and his girlfriend Linda, who is used by the military as a surrogate for the god's plans. The inhabitants of the Neo Kenya called upon a god by the name of Anubis (a reference to the Egyptian lord of the underworld) in order to protect them from imminent destruction. Apparently answering their calls, the dark god sent an Ark similar to Noah's Ark. He demands that a man and a woman gather two of every animal on the planet. The army nominated Ken and Linda to achieve this task.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Alfa System","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"dacb4643-cc08-48c2-80a0-d2d7f0a9d123.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"fac6f1d5-a7b6-4dd7-8bee-b447eaa228af.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"d3abacc1-6dfe-4a42-81f3-0d282ccde74a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"96bf5239-6ec7-445f-b0d6-cde42acebbeb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"3d59561e-ef0e-4d62-a10a-1444c4de59ed.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"76b3ba59-b5f4-4c91-880b-d82ad8bb1436.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"cf8212be-593b-4de9-8959-975242e29127.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"a1b3eef7-4e65-4607-a034-546dc7ac6cb4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"60bb570b-5421-407e-a4b8-4995b6623420.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"1b5bac68-e91a-47c8-b07a-f73c63f6cbcb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"94e249ce-c1bf-4751-8515-3a86fd0fea79.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"d0cd4b4e-fbed-444a-af92-ba100bbc48ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"82f670b2-599d-4fd9-8407-5eb0113c8018.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"ae4c2cbc-6a89-4b5c-8b1a-ac10f9cc40cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"2bec60ae-ffc1-4b64-b7cf-8283ee7a739b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"0c32a984-0dac-4c53-b69d-3902754b18d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"25fadbe7-02b7-44c4-93ab-e79e14ebee95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"295686a3-2210-4d26-9153-9967210cd8af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"FileName":"5c8d6638-1436-4ef7-ac48-e0c1e3760296.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":163513,"AlternateName":"Linda^3","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163513,"AlternateName":"Linda 3","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":9999,"Name":"Loom","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called \"drafts\" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.\n\nEach draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be \"reversed\", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKoVLIxcHI","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"88da3e53-357c-49f0-9898-8fbc54d992f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"361a9911-3ae9-48d5-bf8b-2d46549952ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"148e53e4-c2a7-4637-8f95-957d6a54b57e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"09913199-8cf4-41f0-8016-4ed6532d710c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"58a5aa66-c871-4493-a91a-43b99c5d1d7b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"ddec96a1-d1eb-4311-83ee-826c39786abe.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"c0361266-480a-4a9b-8ff7-944871fc5b20.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"2e0af348-b97d-4037-8d24-47a195cf6677.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"bd2af65a-746a-47ee-9c44-6e3ff45c056e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9999,"FileName":"cb9da40b-ce89-48e3-8e3f-50993ede4029.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156726,"Name":"Lord of Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lord of Wars is a turn-based tank strategy game.

Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...\n\nLa Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.\n\nHowever, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.\n\nThe entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no \"world map\", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on \"level-grinding\"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156742,"FileName":"af93ac94-2b0b-4e28-a6cb-aefdbd355d31.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156742,"FileName":"03554887-71de-4b65-8324-d670ee2ead02.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156742,"FileName":"8d16dcbf-079b-4c4a-a01b-d86d0503b28a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156742,"FileName":"d1d3e356-2756-4389-9a32-f6eefde844f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156742,"AlternateName":"Mashō Denki: La Valeur","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":156743,"Name":"Master of Monsters","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death.

You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.\n\nYour aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"SystemSoft","Publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1991-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156743,"FileName":"2ea77066-62ab-48fc-aeb2-043f2b8a375d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156743,"FileName":"cb02566e-5834-4dca-ab40-6dc33ee21b85.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156743,"FileName":"ab50d884-129c-4b54-a0af-d9edd1f2ed06.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156744,"Name":"Mateki Densetsu Astralius","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians.

The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called \"performing\" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind.

Matsuura, hot off the disbanding of his pop group PSY'S, wrote a vocal song and some incidental music for the game. As for the game itself, it's a rather standard shooter, but is also notable as an early creation of Flight Plan, the developer that went on to create such notable titles as Summon Night, Black/Matrix, Poison Pink, et al. Definitely worth a go if you're a fan of either Matsuura or Flight Plan, and a decent enough, if merely workmanlike effort otherwise. Try it. \nI actually bought a copy of this game when last I was in Tokyo, and presented it to Matsuura at his office during an informal interview.

The player controls a spaceship navigated by an astronaut named Stryker, who is sent on a mission to destroy dangerous asteroids in space. There are four different ships to choose from, each with different power and speed ratings. The player can move the ship and rotate its cannon to shoot asteroids. Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level. \n\nThe DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses.\n\nAlso included on the CD is a timed mode (\"Caravan Mode\") of Implode, as well as the puzzle game Loop, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"MindRec","Publisher":"MindRec","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"d810a43f-315d-4bd1-b2f3-a6f9e588c94c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"47c21247-fba4-42ec-971b-a70bd50e5f73.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"3b85d95b-4967-49cf-b6ab-6d4357657290.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"76e4cf58-6c9a-4c14-98c2-4a13e1276afe.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"b1e74809-99e5-4df5-9f07-8df0ebc56d03.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"0d210db4-dfc1-48bd-ab3c-f078df13924b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155545,"FileName":"158fa8e7-7fa1-4d15-abbb-9c5184f7720a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123565,"Name":"Might and Magic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fantasy stat-driven RPG.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvSLA5KFRZU","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"NEC Avenue","Publisher":"NEC Avenue","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123565,"FileName":"c0fe15bf-a08c-4dd8-9f9e-dfe3ab448b55.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123565,"FileName":"8fd6169f-6554-46aa-b520-e73351c734a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123565,"FileName":"3fdad461-8536-48b8-a4de-81bcf2b8197a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123565,"FileName":"6300dd00-b846-47ed-9bad-376daea714a7.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123565,"FileName":"8029b6d1-830c-4bd1-bc2c-75c4bfe41fa0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123565,"FileName":"51743b22-bb78-411d-a7f0-bb82f542d4fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10002,"Name":"Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Emerging from the depths of the nebulous void, there came four lords.

On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.\n\nThree main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.\n\nA second mode is a mission mode (\"voyage mode\" in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.\n\nThe Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled \"Cook's Quest\", in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Arc Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"74114b56-f428-4354-8a99-dbabbd524455.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"12c9356d-5300-410b-9bb4-fa6c1bbd32fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"6bee13d0-8bdc-4d36-8b34-d4d5775d3d63.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"0993be4d-5414-4cfa-80df-f962ae0ecc3e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"8bc16ee6-dfaa-413a-ac7f-8dd6a896d256.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"ac677200-4094-4e59-b76b-6a84b60745ea.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"d940cbfd-763c-4d51-a03c-4f5882376cd3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133089,"FileName":"89eabacb-b15b-48fc-9a17-401bc11f80ee.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":111720,"Name":"Mirai Shounen Conan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Straightforward platform game based on famous anime director Hayao Miyazaki’s TV series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Riot","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":111720,"FileName":"641c5e31-e83c-43ba-91be-879991996892.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111720,"FileName":"a661f7b5-8c31-42e8-9ca3-aac75df97eb1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111720,"FileName":"81b458bb-0326-461f-8166-dea02c49ce89.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111720,"FileName":"01a760fc-0227-436a-a4f9-a93ccc489575.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111720,"FileName":"e1dfa2fd-ff3b-4419-8387-d4394df56e64.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111720,"FileName":"e90b456a-4c30-4210-ad7c-64284b08447a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156746,"Name":"Mitsubachi Gakuen","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mitsubachi Gakuen is an adventure game in which the player takes the role of a teacher in the Mitsubachi Academy, entrusted with the task of helping its female students to reach stardom by monitoring their studies and activities.

The Slasher starts its mission with a standard Vulcan gun (\"Rapid Shot/Wide Shot\") and more weapons are available along the way such as homing flame-lasers (\"Guided Fire\"), side missiles (\"Crawl Missile\"), lasers, shields and secondary flying pods (\"Funnel\"). Unlike most of its peers, Nexzr is as bare as it gets on the weapon/power-up side.

The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and purchase healing and status-recovering items.

The final damage is calculated after the mahjong game is over, and depends on the characters' levels, equipment, and the winning combination. For example, winning the game with a full mahjong would most likely result in a \"critical hit\". Boss enemies typically take two or more rounds of mahjong to defeat.\n\nIn addition, the game features a versus mode, which allows the player to compete in mahjong games against the opponents of the RPG mode, with weapons, equipment, and level parameters playing no role. These opponents appear as monsters at first, but are revealed to be pretty young women who remove parts of their clothes when losing a mahjong round; stripping down to underwear equals defeat.

The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this \"baby action\", the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).\n\nInstead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.). The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective.

Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.\n\nEach town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy.

Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.\n\nThe game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area. Lykos has eight lives consisting of smaller health units (hearts). The game can only be saved in the town.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291WttQlslI","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"ICOM Simulations, Inc.","Publisher":"Turbo Technologies, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"5a32d370-d829-485b-8bc4-b7ed47200997.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"0bcd6b40-0892-4f8e-b0c7-22c68a590e96.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"24c86a36-bf74-4159-a2d8-33e09bf5dfe2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"deefdd1f-9415-4dde-b8b7-5dd072507d35.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"118ca7f9-ec19-4a6d-9e7f-f0f10a6708da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"e59a802f-7a46-411b-9588-9cefa08da6bc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"d2d3c422-5906-452b-9c21-c258b6a3deb8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"2ee51116-eb7e-4731-86d0-f31e308faa9a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"e1850229-a76c-49a5-902c-751245728f27.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"05094043-9557-42a1-a3ef-fdc7adfe013a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"FileName":"030ab0cd-d3f5-44cf-a0ae-02d2c2b9725f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10005,"AlternateName":"Makai Eiyuuden: Shape Shifter","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10005,"AlternateName":"Makai Eiyuuden - Shape Shifter","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10005,"AlternateName":"Shapeshifter: Makai Eiyuuden","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":10006,"Name":"Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective can be described as a hybrid of adventure game and simulation.

The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156839,"FileName":"000138f6-4e61-47b0-8100-c1f3570c04d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156839,"FileName":"6aaff74c-c236-4d4b-822d-8d76b211084f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156839,"FileName":"7b1280d7-8f64-4aca-b4a4-148d68fcf9a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156839,"FileName":"90e09164-0052-4046-8880-96cc5c5f0be4.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156840,"Name":"Sotsugyou 2: Neo Generation","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Graduation is a Japanese anime \"life-sim\" game.

The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Headroom","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156842,"FileName":"ff4a636b-680b-45fb-b048-dda52f56fa41.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156842,"FileName":"5911f5b1-1833-4199-b549-059e48dd7c5b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156842,"FileName":"20c7979e-5944-432c-bf69-a6d57f13435b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156658,"Name":"Space Adventure Cobra II: Densetsu no Otoko","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Visual Novel","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156658,"FileName":"2eead17a-985e-4967-bc39-d402bfe02f3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156658,"FileName":"f4ecf131-ad71-4e9c-9343-f3d627808d22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156658,"FileName":"a6b479ea-77d1-4aee-a2ab-503b3c445bbe.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156658,"FileName":"d8c8f657-5ab9-4108-8f64-c76a6452cb5a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156658,"FileName":"0009709d-30cb-4893-8e3b-c64b231a0931.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156658,"FileName":"dd211898-b10d-4ef0-8f68-2c67bed7f33d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11037,"Name":"Space Adventure Cobra: Kokuryuuou no Densetsu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"While waiting in a bar for his partner, Cobra encounters a beautiful bounty hunter named Jane.

There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.\n\nThe game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.\n\nDifferent units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles.

The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.\n\nThe game is set in the inner half of the solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius.\n\nThe red/green/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function: respectively, upgrades to the \"missile\" main weapon and \"bomb\" subweapon, and a shield to absorb some damage. Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new \"laser\" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons.\n\nActually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before.\n\nAnother new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as \"captains\"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In Darius II, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"A Wave","Publisher":"NEC","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"983467aa-06d3-4c70-98ed-1ff7f0d7e85f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"ee1eb9fd-684d-42ca-8f93-884f8a4848f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"693a4e6a-c6a2-4175-84c3-a14a6da09a47.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"ae868374-c47e-4689-9abe-8527026a95f3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"513fb53a-d2ca-4f78-ad60-2771a756e387.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"cf6ac7f3-dbf4-484b-beb8-dd5b842ffd5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"8b027b21-e6eb-44b4-a1d1-4cf463274815.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"4158eea7-1ca6-4f42-b825-8652bfe134e6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"37a2ae69-a2ed-46c4-8b15-1c02161caa7c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"4eb84175-9e7b-48d3-9e1f-3f423d5e788c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"686f36f9-c50b-4c46-964a-547155bcaa5e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27100,"FileName":"0b097bf7-543e-42d9-84a8-88b486c790f8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156846,"Name":"Super Mahjong Taikai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super Mahjong Taikai is a follow-up to Mahjong Taikai.

Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified.

Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level).

Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.\n\nNavigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.\n\nFields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them.

The player-controlled group competes against other agencies in a league, and results are shown after each major event.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Headroom","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156859,"FileName":"ed33e06b-4a9d-45e7-a662-856c4c822c64.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156859,"FileName":"ddc92af2-7933-4c62-a69f-5e09bbfa19da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156859,"FileName":"ac437d2f-1acc-49de-8cbe-c5b1aad9ba3b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133110,"Name":"Tecmo World Cup Super Soccer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tecmo World Cup Super Soccer is quite different from the similarly-named Tecmo World Cup Soccer.

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. \n\nFour historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.\n\nThe game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called \"tactics\" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.\n\nStages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"NEC Avenue, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"620f4a83-1b6c-466f-9584-8f9eae4feb4d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"8e383823-c89d-418d-b14d-28be17a166ba.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"4482992a-1f14-4932-a4e0-e5644f8b280a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"113cab6b-0cb4-4c0d-bc15-5f6b88514a74.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"4494aa9e-0c96-4063-b286-213e8eb6ffcb.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"a431a66b-de2f-4514-90f1-510ecf2dce16.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"FileName":"31f370fb-1339-43db-8321-0d9277119c34.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":133111,"AlternateName":"Tenchi o Kurau","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":133111,"AlternateName":"Dynasty Wars","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":149490,"Name":"Tengai Makyou: Deden no Den","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Bomberman '94 Special Version was a limited edition game with approximately 10,000 copies produced and only given away through Hudson's newsletter and at one of their caravan tournament site, apparently (source).

This game's events happen 15 years after those of Valis III and introduce a new protagonist: Lena Brande.\nStory\nHundreds of years ago, the king Asfal from the Dark World had a son, Galgear, who was driven insane by the power of a ring that he inherited from his father, causing wars and widespread destruction in order to make that power grow constantly.\n\nConsequently, the gods imprisoned Galgear and his followers in a giant crystal and sank it under the seas.\n\nMany centuries have passed and the crystal emerges to the surface once again with Galgear and his army broken free, bringing an end to the short-lived era of peace enjoyed by Vecanti after Glames' defeat in Valis III.\n\nWith his reign of chaos reestablished, Glames takes over Vecanti and starts to take over the human world also. Galgear then kidnaps Vecanti's current queen, Valna, and prepares her execution.\n\nMeanwhile, a resistance force in the dream world led by Cham tries to fight Galgear's regime but this seems to be useless. Lena, a member of the resistance, decides to rescue Valna along with her sister Amu. Although Cham isn't in accordance with her, she hears Yuuko's voice telling her to let Lena go. Having no other option, Cham teaches them some basic things and then stays behind in Vecanti guarding the city and the survivors.\n\nLena and Amu manage to infiltrate Castle Vanity and defeat the first of Galgear's generals, Dhalgen. Then they find Valna and try to rescue her just to be stopped and injured by Galgear himself, meeting him personally for the first time. Just as he is going to deal the heroines the final blow, they are teleported away by a stranger who reveals himself to be Asfal, Galgear's father himself, who also wants to stop his son's evil regime. He tells Lena that the only thing that can defeat his son is the Valis sword, which isn't in this world anymore, and that they have to reach Valhalla in the sky in order to obtain It from Yuuko, the most recent Valis warrior and current guardian of the sword.\n\nAfter overcoming many obstacles, they meet Yuuko who warns Lena about the things she will have to live as a Valis warrior by showing her memories and asks if she still wants to become a Valis warrior. Lena answers decidedly that she will accept that destiny if she can save the three worlds from Galgear. Yuuko then tests her with satisfactory results and gives her the Valis sword and thus the Valis armor.\n\nAfterward, the three protagonists make their way into the human world to reach the giant crystal Galgear uses as his base. After beating many of his henchmen and his last two generals, they find Galgear trying to kill Valna once again. It seems to be too late to save her, but Amu steps in front of Galgear's axe throw, saving Valna's life but being mortally injured.\n\nAsfal releases Valna and holds off his son while Amu dies in her sister's arms. Lena then addresses Galgear, saying that she will put an end to him once and for all. Galgear challenges her to come and fight him in his lair, the red moon, where Asfal lived when he was king.\n\nLena and Asfal open a path to the red moon where they fight Galgear, defeating him sucessfully. Asfal and Galgear apologize to each other respectively for all that has happened, after which Galgear dies in the arms of his father. Lena then goes to Amu's grave to pay her last respects and starts to walk toward the horizon, asking herself what will await in the future.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZKZaLS-pn4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Shin-Nihon Laser Soft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.\n\nThe game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.\n\nThe gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"HuneX Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Human Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-07-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153926,"FileName":"3772b8d8-95df-459a-819e-c3d642deb322.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153926,"FileName":"c8493e8d-d385-460c-ae5a-fc879fe62012.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":153926,"AlternateName":"バスティール2","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":156878,"Name":"Virgin Dream","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A \"Pretty Girl Contest\" is held, which is more than just a regular beauty competition: within a year, a young girl should become a star.

Enemy sprites are also drawn in a more detailed fashion. A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names (\"Fighter\", \"Samurai\", etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of Might and Magic), however, remains possible.

Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.\n\nWizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords.

Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7tukIGyyJM&ab_channel=NerdNoiseRadio","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Mutech","Publisher":"Sofix Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":127229,"FileName":"a4fedefc-c5de-4b2b-99f4-36a0d4b2ef9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127229,"FileName":"32769dfd-ed36-4e47-8ddc-94b5bf1e5718.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127229,"FileName":"e93a37ca-e534-4995-b0b1-a54ec94bb4bc.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127229,"FileName":"2dabf57a-310e-4e2e-9882-c785d41b8cc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127229,"FileName":"04d572ae-0aa9-47e3-80ca-99b1bf942d95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156833,"Name":"Yokoyama Mitsuteru Shin Sangokushi: Tenka wa Ware ni","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.\n\nInvading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"NAXAT Soft","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156833,"FileName":"fd20e87c-4920-4944-b6ec-7fc493f47a9a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156833,"FileName":"d81aff5a-6fb8-41a8-930f-e8b4b9f96983.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5686,"Name":"Ys Book I & II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Journey through the Ancient Land of Ys, a once peaceful and prosperous country suddenly thrust deep into an empty abyss of isolation.

The evil Lord Darm has been defeated, and it's time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences.\n\nYs IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.\n\nYs IV has received a full fan translation and fan dub of all the in-game dialogue.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"1e2b292a-ff8a-4579-88df-1f72b6e16cb6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"1c0e9da9-06f1-4244-8919-f295bce9e4c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"687a7455-768d-4c53-9b21-6dd08d70bdc5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"071b780c-3e91-4348-9856-10c0870f0675.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"1a51a219-54d1-4e09-9015-a1968c3d2473.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"5adc255f-12db-461c-acdc-5f21d2cc3387.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"8f292629-a2c1-4598-8cce-00f2cfac2643.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10014,"FileName":"dc302baa-1729-48f6-83c3-3f670bc08680.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29754,"Name":"Yuu Yuu Hakusho Yamishoubu!!
