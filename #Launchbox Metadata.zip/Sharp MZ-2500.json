Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train.

There is a choice of eight wrestlers, each with a different look and a different set of moves. They resemble contemporary American and Japanese wrestlers but are unlicensed (e.g. H. Hogen, A. Giant). Characters can be moved in eight directions and three buttons are used to execute the moves. The game takes place in a large ring with a referee, but it is also possible throw out a wrestler at the bottom and continue fighting below. The referee will start a countdown then and the wrestlers have twenty seconds to get back in the ring. A single round takes three minutes.\n\nThe wrestlers can brawl with a large amount of moves, from kicks and punches to holds, pins, throws, piledrivers, hurtling an opponent into the ropes to make them run into an elbow and so on. Wrestler health is shown through coloured pain waves the wrestlers radiate when they are down. Yellow waves usually refer to a short stun, while red ones are dangerous as they can lead to a game-ending pin as the referee counts down. There is a score system and three circles near the top of the screen are used to keep track of the standings over different rounds.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp MZ-2500","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Micronet Co.

Finally, Arion and Geedo (a huge ape-like creature who had become Arion's friend and companion) left the Underworld to find Zeus. Seneca, a small thief, makes off with Arion's sword and this leads Arion to his first encounter with the forces of Zeus, commanded by his daughter Athena. Arion is captured but is later set free by Lesfeena, Athena's mute serving girl. As Arion rejoins Geedo and Seneca (and worries about Lesfeena), the forces of Zeus and Poseidon face each other in battle. In the background sits the scheming Hades, and the calm Apollon who seems to have plans of his own.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/cC5XieZ20lM","Platform":"Sharp MZ-2500","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190651,"FileName":"85b47d7a-4024-4207-8cfb-b58d4bf2619b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190651,"FileName":"91e233d5-7715-4e6f-81e3-360f33d3d9a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190651,"FileName":"f29edcb0-5db9-4bfe-8805-de13b5c8a8e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190651,"FileName":"e784440d-8b4c-42f7-8a02-3918ee26b301.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":190651,"AlternateName":"Neo Heroic Fantasia Arion","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188098,"Name":"Back to the Future","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"This video game incarnation of the movie Back to the Future (1985) is a Japanese-style adventure game with visual novel elements.

Although known as a graphic adventure game (or 'Role Venture Comic' as Microcabin calls it), it is probably more accurate to call it a dungeon crawler as you spend the entire game navigating through a labyrinth.\n\nThe game was released for several computer platforms with some differences between them, such as a different map layout. The most notable changes were made for the IBM JX and Sharp MZ-2500 versions. Released some months after the original, these versions completely ditch the digitized artwork and went for a more conventional aesthetic. All the menus are in Japanese, with some of the more useless commands removed (such as 'Kick'). It also uses all of the Japanese scripts, as opposed to just hiragana like in the original. Extra scenes and characters have been added, such as an encounter with a giant called Geirrod, but the overall plot remains the same.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp MZ-2500","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186907,"FileName":"77c92ffd-986d-47d8-83b5-25844b1b4952.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186907,"FileName":"e836fba1-a98d-4154-aa5c-ab63ccd774ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186907,"FileName":"595b3358-2b3d-445f-845a-7affa15df339.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184046,"Name":"Excitebike","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Race by yourself against the clock or compete with other motocross riders on 5 tracks full of long straights, large jumps and obstacles to win the Excitebike championship.\n\nCreate your own tracks by placing jumps and obstacles of all different sizes and shapes on the track and choosing how many laps each race will have, then race against the clock or other riders to see how your track fares in competition.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/rpGjNzlr-qs","Platform":"Sharp MZ-2500","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184046,"FileName":"9bdf3a50-824f-4f1c-b8ba-34e9b8b151f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":184046,"FileName":"893466de-b237-4cad-ae1e-2c9c63230a30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184046,"FileName":"c9ba8319-2ff6-467e-8c06-32a8b532cd35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184046,"FileName":"337e58ec-a458-4bbc-bfd4-ad34cde809ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":184046,"AlternateName":"Excite Bike","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":193096,"Name":"Gomoku Narabe","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Gomoku Narabe, also known as Gobang, Omok and Wuzechi, is a strategic board game. \"Go\" means \"five\" in Japanese, \"Moku\" means \"pieces\" and \"Narabe\" means to line up in a row.

In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp MZ-2500","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Dempa Shimbunsha","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177885,"FileName":"102d593b-6160-4b3b-b6e8-07a5b2183677.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177885,"FileName":"33b08eee-1e3f-4542-922b-06dbe07ea699.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177885,"FileName":"cde79e3b-91df-4774-b6ec-f23b1464ca73.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177885,"FileName":"f05741e2-0257-4df8-820a-40459ab730b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
