In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","Publisher":"Dempa Shimbunsha","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"184046":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Excite Bike"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"9bdf3a50-824f-4f1c-b8ba-34e9b8b151f4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"893466de-b237-4cad-ae1e-2c9c63230a30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c9ba8319-2ff6-467e-8c06-32a8b532cd35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Excitebike","Overview":"Race by yourself against the clock or compete with other motocross riders on 5 tracks full of long straights, large jumps and obstacles to win the Excitebike championship.\n\nCreate your own tracks by placing jumps and obstacles of all different sizes and shapes on the track and choosing how many laps each race will have, then race against the clock or other riders to see how your track fares in competition.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rpGjNzlr-qs"},"186906":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7585f7c4-38d5-4548-91a7-1139424adb8a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5d50a0b-d4bf-4dc3-a796-0fa47825e9c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e8ca3795-bf86-47cf-bf75-ec0ec02bdf78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika","Overview":"Players become Temujin, who has just become 20, and fight to unify the Mongolian plains.

However it is said that only a legendary weapon can slay the creature...\n\nNot to be confused with Falcom's Eiyuu Densetsu RPG series, Eiyuu Densetsu Saga (Legendary Hero Saga) was originally a PC98 game developed by Arrowsoft and published by Microcabin back in 1984. Although known as a graphic adventure game (or 'Role Venture Comic' as Microcabin calls it), it is probably more accurate to call it a dungeon crawler as you spend the entire game navigating through a labyrinth.\n\nThe game was released for several computer platforms with some differences between them, such as a different map layout. The most notable changes were made for the IBM JX and Sharp MZ-2500 versions. Released some months after the original, these versions completely ditch the digitized artwork and went for a more conventional aesthetic. All the menus are in Japanese, with some of the more useless commands removed (such as 'Kick'). It also uses all of the Japanese scripts, as opposed to just hiragana like in the original. Extra scenes and characters have been added, such as an encounter with a giant called Geirrod, but the overall plot remains the same.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"186908":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compac Inc.","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"00bd046e-4122-47a3-a403-b41d9ff098a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e1a2244e-f56f-4953-b698-9cd14a53a0ef.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8872fadb-5685-4321-a511-cc06e361c627.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1a7df9b3-7323-485c-99c5-1a807dab8c7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nobo","Publisher":"Compac Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/lbfLVfq5Q-Y"},"186909":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"2178aeb6-ebda-4f2a-b644-e692b927d36c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"41caf297-73f0-48fc-ae0a-f0b6a0997e93.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"581e48ce-3c99-46d6-8519-07c839f046ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f1206cf3-4f98-4c29-9ff7-637b9a387da7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nobunaga no Yabou","Overview":"Players assume the mantle of either Nobunaga Oda or Shingen Takeda and strive to conquer the entire land (17 areas in the Kansai and central Japan region).
