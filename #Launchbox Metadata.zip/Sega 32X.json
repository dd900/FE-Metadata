The game was to star a variety of selectable rodents attached to rocket packs who could travel through a series of connected tubes, fighting each other and avoiding various obstacles.\n\nIt was built solely with the 32X in mind, however after the console failed development moved to the Sega Saturn for a short while before being axed completely. It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the \"Virtua\" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the title Virtual Hamster instead.\n\nIn August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map). A resets the game, and B/C can be used to move the camera forwards and backwards through the tube.

You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega 32X","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Chilly Willy","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-05-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183911,"FileName":"a5178f86-be74-4688-8e1d-67a77030db6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183911,"FileName":"86e56907-3947-45db-b994-e6da63de66b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183911,"FileName":"8692ed12-5c15-4bce-8f8c-4717e752ece6.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183911,"AlternateName":"Rick Dangerous 32x","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183778,"Name":"Yeti 3D","ReleaseYear":"2011","Overview":"What started as a 3D engine for the Game Boy Advance was ported to many platforms, including iPhone and Sega 32X.

The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.\n\nAlthough the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKqHbZDJSPY","Platform":"Sega 32X","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"CRI","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"e2ae950d-d284-46e1-a09e-dfb750968b9b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"b2291b55-8127-48ba-bf32-49e02e710371.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"56f49dbf-a2db-44b6-97c5-2752cd1091cb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"3127bc08-a685-4eca-88c3-cd19834e5c18.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"f9dfed93-b90e-4c08-b422-044e4808bd9c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"6125da07-5976-4368-b1d5-cddb7c37ae5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"2fbf9cc1-c34b-418a-837e-49eaa20eeca9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"d20f217a-12c6-42af-8f9a-a2c76ad91f02.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"64d38743-1eee-4480-8fa2-d3f16246a94d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"9dd8f0c5-f1e1-4d41-ac3d-2ac412c5232f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"b4861f1f-7d87-44a8-993f-f3e3500e8869.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"b580e9da-fb25-4b58-9a38-75667efc551a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"d5aa126a-8123-4106-974d-faec35bbbb85.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"790e08b7-babf-4db7-945a-43391f75af38.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"754f3e56-1f0b-48bf-b3b2-52f28544f7e2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"803f1c49-cbc9-416e-979d-247680b06704.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"0cd0fb7e-5c58-4b98-9275-be02a5205fb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"12dc8a72-0986-4cff-a6f5-d88f82399a29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"a3c9ffbf-1254-4598-8429-790b144256bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"FileName":"94b4e95c-57a2-4cd8-b35c-f289e71cdd0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9083,"AlternateName":"Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"AlternateName":"Motherbase","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":9083,"AlternateName":"Parasquad","Region":"Japan"}]}]}
