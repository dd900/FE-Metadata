It was not until the middle of the 21th century that humanity started to recover from its losses. Earth was nearly abandoned, and representative of the most powerful countries concentrated on space colonization projects. The Americans founded an organization called NSCA (National Space Colonized Association). Their project, SC (Space Colony), was a huge tower, comparable to the mythical Tower of Babel. This is also the home of the game's protagonist, who returns after prolonged space travels, and soon becomes involved in a complex struggle between countries and political organizations.\n\nThe fifth installment of System Sacom's Novel Ware series, 38000 Kilo no Kokū is essentially a visual novel. The majority of the game consists of text - dialogues, descriptions of the hero's thoughts and actions, and an extensive database concerning the scientific/political background of the game. Though graphical images (usually of people) are displayed by default in small windows, they can be turned off. The player follows the story, sometimes altering its course by selecting an action/response when such a choice is given to him by the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Visual Novel","Developer":"System Sacom","Publisher":"System Sacom","ReleaseDate":"1989-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":150091,"FileName":"db8739b7-65f3-41d9-bd22-c894a5100f75.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150091,"FileName":"53048e86-41cb-405f-b3f5-a21adc16c52f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150091,"FileName":"deaf2573-7ea2-40c9-b52b-967dbacc3f26.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150091,"FileName":"ff7d92a1-6df0-4821-806c-5d06961292ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150091,"FileName":"bc82a673-f85c-4a26-9f8e-7e8556a368e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150091,"FileName":"a64babf5-721d-4223-b7e1-0fafa411a328.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":150091,"AlternateName":"38000 Kilo no Kokū","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":156887,"Name":"4th Unit: Act 3 Dual Target","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Three months have passed since the destruction of the oceanic base of the criminal organization WWWF.

In addition, they have developed a bionic soldier who is a clone of Blon-Win.

The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses (\"happy\", \"angry\", etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between \"Rescue\", \"Think\", and \"Fight\" commands during the storyline. These choices may influence the plot and lead the game to different endings, most of which are considered \"false\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156887,"FileName":"c7099866-db89-47ef-a635-b0b5b96f98d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156887,"AlternateName":"Dual Targets: The 4th Unit Act.3","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":150267,"Name":"A Ressha de Ikou II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Play the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating a railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world.

As the story progresses, Jeda finds that there is a hole in his dimension, and the only way to repair this hole is to travel through other dimensions (and time) to seek out a mystical holy sword and a group of CDs that will restore things to their proper nature. Throughout this journey, there are numerous cameos and other appearances by other Wolf Team and Nippon Telenet characters from various other media (The Valis Series, Midgarts, Final Zone, etc.).

Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.\n\nA young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.\n\nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Right Stuff Corp.","Publisher":"Right Stuff Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146780,"FileName":"a95281b8-d336-4aac-aca9-4363f8ee4da7.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146780,"FileName":"3aec1132-d4cf-4962-806e-83404eb5a332.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146780,"FileName":"afdd9939-0e43-4ee5-ac0d-95db06a592ed.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":146780,"FileName":"628ca5b9-a9d4-4046-af01-20123a8a2fcb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156949,"Name":"AmbivalenZ: Niritsu Haihan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shura was once a young knight whose duty was to protect the princess of his kingdom.

Enter Jedah Chaf, a young man who has left his home village to fulfill his dream of becoming a knight. Will Jedah be able to save his country and to restore peace in the world?\n\nArcus is a RPG that is played entirely from first-person perspective. You navigate your hero by choosing a location from a menu. Once in dungeons, you have a separate menu whenever you encounter enemies. You fight them in turn-based combat, attacking physically or casting magic.

Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on.

In it, the player travels, in the traditional manner, from left to right, killing enemies as you go. One standout feature is the sword meter, which decreases every time you make a normal attack, and replenishes gradually when you're not attacking. You do also have an alternate attack, in the form of a sliding kick, performed by pressing the attack button at the same time as hitting the ground after a jump or fall. The sliding kick doesn't deplete the sword meter, and in fact quickly replenishes a large portion of it.\n\nThe stages are designed with precision, and they expect to be played with precision in return. The first stage allows the player to get acquainted with the controls and mechanics, but as soon as the first boss is defeated, the game no longer has any mercy. There are jumps which require pixel-perfect accuracy, and a little later, situations that require that accuracy in jumping, but also perfect timing in attacking, and all in tiny time frames with no space for error.\n\nThe maker, E. Hashimoto, later went on to make a few fairly well-known PC games, such as Akuji the Demon, and Guardian of Paradise. He's also made a pseudo-remake of Buster, 11 years after the original was released.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT2gMwbkJao","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"E.Hashimoto","Publisher":"Eiji Hashimoto","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"8f60862b-2ade-4257-b0b4-d1821953d21a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"2ecc13ef-b3c8-4419-8224-89fd14d38cf4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"86cd9158-e021-42d3-8778-94639378bf66.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"8f12790b-4eec-4eda-bd38-44dce522467c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"38895af2-0196-4851-909e-286ca90a4807.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"b26f1a6e-e88a-4c78-879d-bd2e5a07368f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"158477b7-4479-46a7-9943-70b8930d358d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"ead35435-cdc2-4458-b769-dca6448b5e76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"7d60806b-8a49-41b3-8e6b-19f03075de61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125825,"FileName":"981f3189-371e-4d5f-a511-535a52bf5b93.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185740,"Name":"Byakuya Monogatari: Winchester Ke no Matsuei","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Byakuya Monogatari: Winchester Ke no Matsuei is an Adventure game, developed and published by East Cube, which was released in Japan in 1989.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"East Cube","Publisher":"East Cube","ReleaseDate":"1989-03-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185740,"FileName":"b7086184-db3e-4805-8037-78ea7ef76a94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185740,"FileName":"44a7f773-6e8e-4765-b042-cf081df902a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185740,"FileName":"da1542e1-085b-4248-a205-b6e51e619612.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184318,"Name":"Cal","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The hero of this game is an ordinary high school student (the player has to name him by himself).

It was later ported in 1992 to the Super NES, and in 1993 to the FM Towns computer. The Super NES release was titled On The Ball in North America and Europe, and was compatible with the Super NES Mouse. The gameplay consists of moving a ball through a labyrinth by rotating the board itself around the ball.\n \nThere's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball. The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.\n\nThat's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero. The game might as well have been named \"inertia.\" Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing. Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o63AkoXtTbU","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Dempa Shinbunsha","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"ca84f9d7-c9a4-45b8-844d-6470e9b62f48.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"47bb6440-0dc6-4e3d-b8be-063273f253f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"1b71abcc-6fe2-422b-ae2b-43b93678d841.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"2f53553a-46fa-4860-be28-73016af46867.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"849b1f1f-07c9-466d-8228-303ea7686d21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"0fc931d5-24d3-425c-b153-b59a7e208093.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"362c488a-73fb-414f-8c93-888d907665fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126918,"FileName":"109c5043-29fa-4ecf-a389-b0d8665e8154.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187432,"Name":"Campaign Hen Daisenryaku II: Sakusen Betsu Map","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A map set add-on for Daisenryaku II: Campaign Version.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"DLC","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sougou Business Assist","Publisher":"Sougou Business Assist","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187432,"FileName":"ae836b02-dedf-4b45-865c-8337d9d4e435.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157437,"Name":"Can Can Bunny","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The story of this game is simple.

The interface is still traditional Japanese-style menu commands, but there are many more locations now, many of which can be freely accessed by clicking on them while on the main map. Once the player has reached the point where he can begin the physical seduction of the girl, the interface switches to point-and-click, with context-sensitive cursor for touching, kissing, etc. It is necessary to try different actions more than once to understand what the girl considers pleasant and what not, otherwise the girl might get angry and the game will be over. There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously). There are also various extras (as the title implies), including an extensive album that arranges various pictures of the girls so that they tell her story, and an additional collection of stories, in which the hero can learn more about the girls he had met in the main game, and even interact with them again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157438,"FileName":"62a25347-a024-4e6f-8f52-b85ea98c5bb8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157438,"FileName":"78294644-7ba6-4dee-bb2e-3fbce80e9d3e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157438,"FileName":"1a3d23a9-f00d-48a8-b2c4-fee894e8e480.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157438,"FileName":"30266aae-9566-41be-9d0a-e195303aee91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157441,"Name":"Can Can Bunny Premiere","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant.

In that dream, a girl was calling him from the outer space, imploring him to help her... The next day, Kazuyuki receives a strange phone call, after which he finds himself on board of a space ship! The girl from his dream appears and introduces herself: she is Marin, one of the members of a special squad that fights mysterious alien beings known as EX. Apparently, her message through time went to the wrong recipient, and now Kazuyuki is \"stuck\" in the end of the twenty-third century, reluctantly helping the beautiful ladies of the assault team to fight aliens - and perhaps engage in other, more pleasant activities.\n\nCosmic Psycho plays predominantly like a typical Japanese adventure, with verb/object commands that must be chosen from a menu repeatedly to trigger the next scene. However, at certain points the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter. Clad in a flying robotic suit, Kazuyuki must blast his way through a (usually very short) stage filled with regular enemies and bosses.\n\nThe game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157450,"FileName":"bd08f1c6-89de-49f0-bcaf-6ef4021ed296.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157450,"FileName":"a4ff4025-c92b-49f8-b04b-d3c821120a02.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157450,"FileName":"92b497bc-1fe8-49ac-acc5-a70f4ce28c0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157450,"FileName":"81433624-4cba-45f9-a491-d5827d19d675.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157450,"FileName":"eb633e4b-30fd-44a7-b6cf-e4e89fcec53d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189857,"Name":"Cosmo Gang: the Puzzle","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Kukan","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189857,"FileName":"af5393c7-ac15-4134-ab9b-9ed77133db71.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189857,"FileName":"ab08eea0-3e63-4412-9a59-e9dd80992c30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189857,"FileName":"251e9cd3-62ec-437e-8b10-b374685bb4d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189857,"FileName":"2c174362-0dd7-4b2d-9600-cf0f969e519e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189857,"FileName":"a8013817-c8e7-4a39-b26f-83694e6d6839.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":144219,"Name":"Cotton","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fantastic Night Dreams: Cotton is a 2D side-scrolling shooter in which the player takes the role of the young witch Cotton, who sets out on her magical broom on a quest to get her favorite candy.

Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.\n\nThe scenarios in this game include:\n\n    A medieval fantasy tale entitled Princess Fantasy, in which the player controls a knight who accompanies a princess on a journey. Depending on the personality choice, the knight can either be brave and compassionate, or cynically take advantage of the helpless girl.\n\n    A typical \"naughty doctor\" story, in which the player - as either male or female school doctor - has to \"examine\" young and pretty female patients, trying not to scare them away by employing too direct methods.\n\n    An encounter between a famous female pop idol and her fan (also female), which leads to a bizarre sexual experience. The player can choose to control the events from the point of view of either the star or the fan.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially that of a visual novel. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are \"neutral\", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered \"bad\" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Alice Soft","Publisher":"Alice Soft","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157486,"FileName":"b0f18696-07be-4b8f-8b0b-16eaf8d0a975.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157486,"FileName":"1bc37251-b570-45d7-b6d2-b5515acf17ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157486,"FileName":"f36555c9-58c9-43b7-8d2c-275b0afec310.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184791,"Name":"D-Again: The 4th Unit Five","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"The criminal trade organization WWWF was finally defeated.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:\n\n    João Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\n    Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\n    Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\n\n    Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. He yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\n    Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\n    Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great privateer in the name of king and country.\n\nRegardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: the Inn, the Item Shop, the Shipyard, the Tavern, the Castle, the Guild Hall, the Church, the Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186161,"FileName":"bdc61896-0137-4ace-bf77-f6e607a40779.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186161,"FileName":"dd3fa2a4-c670-4c8c-8748-cf931ce6efd1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186161,"FileName":"1dac57fa-26b0-4f43-886c-9d46f7be9e7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186161,"FileName":"18afe245-1bdd-466f-85ad-fd5f2756e2f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186161,"FileName":"c645e451-d25a-4f55-95f5-59f7b7058bd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186161,"FileName":"e8dcd052-c9b1-46a5-b7e5-1b9cfb20c665.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186161,"AlternateName":"New Horizons","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":126917,"Name":"Daimakaimura","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins).

Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5THxu-3A84","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"CAPCOM Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"9c981d5a-4b29-4d09-b068-ab3b3f094ace.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"4fa30f1c-5c6a-41fd-b449-47346b8cb7b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"3842016f-b00f-49a3-92d7-154742fd35f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"d9c1cc91-ef92-4208-9b33-d47255c9268f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"c8e9e87c-aa5d-4517-a170-93dd7f69c7d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"9cb92220-aeb8-459a-8b5d-ad9fdc92be70.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"97e1fed5-1b1d-4614-9e9c-a6149435ea2b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"1c5ca126-d13c-451b-9820-7d67c9e6c2d3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"e411b4a2-39e2-42cc-a161-dc57cbdd1314.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"936d8ba6-fca2-40d5-b021-1435092e086b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126917,"FileName":"e2dd42c8-e5bd-4f51-b92a-2c8d50383b55.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":126917,"AlternateName":"Ghouls 'N Ghosts","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126917,"AlternateName":"Dai Makai-Mura","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126917,"AlternateName":"Daimakaimura","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":189936,"Name":"Daisenryaku II Unit Editor","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A homebrew add on for Daisenfyaku II to allow editing the statistics of units to make changes to make them more accurate or change the unit power.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"DLC","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cyber Factory","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189936,"FileName":"aeb7a749-733f-43b9-a278-2375704a4bf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189936,"FileName":"1ea7d2ee-3189-4bc1-8b33-d05733719376.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157457,"Name":"Daisenryaku II: Campaign Version","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Daisenryaku II: Campaign Version is a turn-based war strategy game that relies on the gameplay template introduced in Daisenryaku II: up to four players engage in battles against each other or computer AI, represented by differently colored armies (blue, red, green, and yellow); the belligerents produce units and vehicles and navigate them on a hex-based grid, trying to occupy the enemy's major cities and harbors.\n\nThe game includes a main campaign with introduction and background information about the fictional countries involved in the conflict.

The game also features timed tasks, when the player has to figure out quickly what to do before the heroes are killed by a zombie.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"FairyTale","Publisher":"FairyTale","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"91d009d2-beed-41b2-9c4f-464e7ff739fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"3b626e74-06ae-47c5-9b47-fb2c10582c42.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"04e4112d-7c33-46ef-8549-0a77dee2dd70.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"6fb09824-e903-4490-b957-a0a4ef014d79.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"ee92ee1f-434b-4133-86ee-f2bb272180da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"ff7eac62-d425-4a04-8eb0-80f94a55c361.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"7973623b-b6d7-47c8-a7b9-30803942dfe8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"FileName":"3b15c640-818c-42bd-a9f9-bc0dd05d4709.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187588,"AlternateName":"Shiryō no Sakebi","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187588,"AlternateName":"Nightmare Collection: Dead of the Brain - Shiryō no Sakeb","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157461,"Name":"Death Bringer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A powerful wizard, yearning for even more power, has found a sacred book that granted him command over armies of demons and men. Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.\n\nDespite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Pandora's RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as \"Attack\", \"Use Magic\", etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Renovation Game","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-03-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157461,"FileName":"1befe6e9-5feb-4fb6-9565-55f2b0bf5aa7.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157461,"FileName":"f744e779-9842-4e55-a1d3-dc37942593b8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157461,"FileName":"93243fff-7582-4277-a577-36cae107118c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157461,"FileName":"211bc7bd-544c-4eba-8f02-9b7de86083d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157461,"FileName":"ee205cc5-f589-49ea-990f-2eb5bb8c06ab.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157461,"FileName":"3563d8bc-7542-47b4-9bdd-d65cd7b661ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189960,"Name":"Death Fighter V2","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"A homebrew fighting game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Battle Arts","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189960,"FileName":"ebbc9e0c-1afc-4dd7-a6aa-1369166e7b36.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189960,"FileName":"011f9b59-eac2-4b15-b778-cb4ac1846580.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189960,"FileName":"4ac31f59-b4cd-4acb-8728-524a0eb0d838.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189960,"FileName":"56034d18-c791-42c0-be8d-836f429e8a0f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189960,"AlternateName":"Death Fighter","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":151455,"Name":"Deflektor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word.

So the first task for the unsuccessful hero will be to get some money. Luckily, the mayor has an assignment for the hero, for which he is also willing to pay.

The gameplay is quite different from that of the previous game. The player travels in top-down view on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, like in most traditional Japanese RPGs. Enemy encounters are random. Battle system differs from most other games of its type by being real-time: combatants appear on a side-scrolling area and exchange attacks automatically; the player can interfere at any time and issue orders to the characters in the party - cast a spell, use an item, or change the attack power level. Physical attacks have a gauge with eight different power levels; the higher the level is, the stronger is the attack, and the slower is its speed.\n\nKnights of Xentar features anime-style cutscenes, many of which contain erotic images - the girls Desmond encounters and helps will often feel grateful and award him with some \"treatment\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Elf Co.

It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.\n\nDragon Spirit is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.\n\nPlayers can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.\n\nThe NES version is unique in that it presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay mode. Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with \"A New Legend\" being its subtitle. In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her.\n\nThe NES version also adds a new initial stage. If the player survives it, the game continues in a \"Blue Dragon\" game much like the original arcade game. If the player fails to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called \"Gold Dragon\" begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit points, and features a different ending.\n\nAlso of note, the TurboGrafx-16 version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed stages.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Micomsoft","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157494,"FileName":"7d1bcf99-02f2-4218-b360-1c257804c3cb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157494,"FileName":"b723ece6-6d3e-4753-8636-72b461e565d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157494,"FileName":"f1b99d5e-cc3c-432c-9424-a7f1243f2d65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157494,"FileName":"d22ce16b-b9c6-48a7-b856-88efa270f836.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157495,"Name":"Dragon Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).\n\nThe player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing.

The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World.

Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members.

It can be considered a shooter, since all the controllable characters can only fight with projectile attacks: Rilule shoots stars that damage enemies in a straight line, her first companion has an area wind attack, etc. As the player completes stages more magicians join the party. Up to three characters can be taken to explore hostile areas; however, the player can only select one character at a time, switching between them at will.\n\nEvery character also possesses a unique powerful magic attack, which depletes MP and is activated by pressing down the action key and charging power. Health- and magic-restoring items can be found in chests or dropped by enemies.

It is divided into many small kingdoms, different nations trying to live in peace with each other. But the queen of Ornic, one of these nations, had plans of her own. She sent her troops to the south, invading the kingdom of elves. The army of Ornic started conquering one country after the other. The king and queen of Cardic, a powerful country in the south, decided to stop the madness, sending their soldiers, under the commands of general Richmond, to find allies wherever possible and to defeat the army of Ornic.\n\nFirst Queen is a mixture of RPG and strategy game with real-time combat. In a RPG fashion, the party of heroes roams the world, fighting enemies, buying items, and leveling up. However, the focus of the game is shifted towards recruiting soldiers and fighting against whole armies. The player-controlled unit may contain a dozen or more characters, and it is also possible to build more than one, making the player-controlled group more similar to an army than to a standard RPG-type party. Like the earlier Silver Ghost by the same developer, the game utilizes the so-called gocha-kyara (\"mixed-up characters\") combat system, which they later employed in several other games. The player is able to control only one character at a time; the others act according to the computer AI. Attacking an enemy is a matter of simply bumping into him. This system allows for large-scale battles, with the characters sometimes filling the entire screen, creating the \"mixed-up\" impression.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Kure Software Koubou","Publisher":"Kure Software Koubou","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157513,"FileName":"1f79d09d-6618-40bd-9b11-72b93af4a47f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157514,"Name":"First Queen II: Sabaku no Joō","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The second entry in First Queen series is set in a pseudo-historical environment, based on real world countries at the time of Roman Empire, but with anachronisms and fantasy elements.

When the country of Frank (sic) plans to rebel against Rome, the emperor sends Aleph on a mission to Alexandria, to convince its king to send his troops to aid Rome in the war.\n\nThe gameplay system is the same as in the first game, mixing elements of RPG, strategy, and real-time combat: the hero recruits soldiers, the small army roams the world, encountering and fighting large groups of enemies in hostile areas.

Their troops attempted to invade Charon, and at the same time professor Toujou has gone missing.

The game includes even more various types of units, including the traditional infantry, rocket launchers (mobile and stationary), different kinds of tanks, planes, helicopters, etc.\n\nThe plot is more elaborate than in the first game, and the cut-scenes between the battles typically include more plot-related information.

Together with Nadia, a runaway circus girl of mysterious African origins, they travel all around the world in an attempt to reveal the secret of Nadia's pendant, pursued by the race of Neo-Atlanteans and their ruthless leader Gargoyle.\n\nThe game's narrative is parallel to later episodes of the show, when the two young heroes have already joined forces with the mysterious Captain Nemo and travel on board the wondrous submarine \"Nautilus\" to the island Fiji, hoping to find the traces of a lost ship on which Jean's father was last sighted.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is a Japanese-style adventure with the typical first-person view, still screens, and menu commands Look, Talk, Think, and Move. As it often happens in games of this genre, the player is usually required to go through the commands several times until the next event is \"triggered\".

However, he soon finds out about a much more serious threat of a global alien invasion. The hero has to travel to the remote future of the 44th century and eventually to the even more remote past of the Cretaceous period to foil their plans.\n\nFuture Wars is a graphic adventure game, and the first to use Delphine's proprietary Cinematique point-and-click interface.

You can equip your N.A.P. with up to 14 different weapons including flamethrowers and landmines and has seven stages, fighting your way on the streets, through deserts and up to the Axis HQ and finally a mech-to-mech battle with the enemy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"82d7e5f4-3b1b-499d-b46b-9e9ed6e5cdf3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"1e6df99c-a836-439a-a95b-6d6edf239500.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"2ea7b9e4-e9b1-4aaa-9e18-b4050efd4e7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"04408c95-3758-4145-843f-6c7a55bbc914.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"b8627d31-9832-447d-b227-6302d04ac9f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"1e21a139-6b8e-4c57-a219-416da7b510a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157512,"FileName":"cfabd8eb-bb89-47c5-b730-384af880e9b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157512,"AlternateName":"Final Zone","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187848,"Name":"G.R.: Gravity Response","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"G.R. is an Eroge Adventure game, developed and published by Tenshindou, which was released in Japan in 1993.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Team Vcut","Publisher":"Tenshindou","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187848,"FileName":"c19b8e21-418e-4ebb-9153-5fb17ba5e812.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187848,"FileName":"ffabfef3-33b0-4e6c-9b43-28e00b5cc510.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187848,"FileName":"3fbe1a3a-5cb1-4794-9236-65e6654ac643.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187848,"FileName":"406888af-ac91-4c33-8f2c-49fc75682206.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190237,"Name":"Gaia Fighter","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"A homebrew vertically scrolling space shooter with bullets galore!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY1saIdhBmY","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Hong Kong Project","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190237,"FileName":"c9c85730-1b4d-4b76-a76f-0c564346787f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190237,"FileName":"68c41d24-b2f3-4fba-a5eb-46ec2fd51314.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190237,"FileName":"4d2dcfe2-18f9-482a-93bc-3a7ce03a630f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190237,"FileName":"c1daee2e-d158-4a6c-ace0-996b648d7a21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":190237,"AlternateName":"Gaia Fighter (v2.5)","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190272,"Name":"Gaiarm","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"An interesting and fun cross between Missile Command, Asteroids and a crosshairs shooter.

Aya is a young girl who just joined the Red Team - first training in safe areas, but hoping to become a real robot pilot later.\n\nThe game plays mostly like a first-person dungeon crawler. The player navigates Aya's robot through pseudo-3D maze-like environments. Hostile robots appear randomly. The combat system is rather simple, with standard Japanese RPG-style options (\"Attack\", \"Flee\", \"Use Item\", etc.). Experience points are gained to level up and become stronger. There are also adventure elements in the game: at any time, pressing the Space key will bring a typical Japanese-style adventure interaction menu with options such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", etc. Movement outside of hostile areas is also done through menu commands. \n \nSold only on the Takeru softwares vending machines in Japan.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Striker","Publisher":"Brother Kougyou","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190273,"Name":"Gal Mind 2","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Coto Software","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190273,"FileName":"6662c6e4-4fda-48bd-bfcb-ea1d58216a51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190273,"FileName":"31820d1d-4400-4da7-9093-fb8ffbffa748.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190273,"FileName":"85ce7397-fb66-405f-ae47-4b7a22aa3d9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157520,"Name":"Galaga '88","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Galaga '88 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds higher-quality graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature \"dancing\" enemies. The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve).\n\nSome enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that \"wiggle\" their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical \"eggs\" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies.\n\nLater in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPrk0oWIIwM","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Micomsoft","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157520,"FileName":"4ec68a28-11fd-4aae-8a2c-22bfe2fd8ccb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157520,"FileName":"a639b487-eac6-444f-8ca4-6a449902eabd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157520,"FileName":"c69015e2-8b63-416e-b199-c6f2227769c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190275,"Name":"Galaxian","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"A incredibly faithful homebrew incarnation of this popular game, Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top.

The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gjx5lkITK0","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"SNK Corporation","Publisher":"Magical Company Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"a7ac5145-b9cc-480a-b58c-07938015aed5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"ba478e6a-bc5c-4086-b1a3-79e4a37512f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"5daa3eeb-8296-4ca1-bbfa-61ca4fd4836c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"866771c1-b1c8-4abc-bc9d-afdf3a764313.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"80aa19b5-987a-402a-8007-e25cdaffd50e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"2c556247-2db5-4811-bb2f-5391b02c2d38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"e5a87bcd-23bc-45fb-b51d-c8f9b3531b20.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"FileName":"6e1e313f-0382-496c-aabd-9add205e3d8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":141507,"AlternateName":"Fatal Fury 2","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":141507,"AlternateName":"Garou Densetsu 2: Aratanaru Tatakai","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157511,"Name":"Garou Densetsu Special","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fatal Fury Special is an improved version of SNK's 2D one-on-one fighter Fatal Fury 2.

The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.\n\nThe game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around \"historical\" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.\n\nThe combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually takes control of a \"home planet\", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map. Enemies typically appear after a few turns; depending on the goal, the player must prevent them from invading planets, destroy them, have his own ships invade a planet, etc.\n\nThe space ships come in different flavors: high-speed battle ships, cruisers, supply ships, etc. Each ship has different mobility, attack range, weapons, defense parameters, etc. Actual combat is displayed on a separate screen and is automatic. The player usually has a choice to use different weapons (cannons, missiles, etc.) against the enemy ships.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Bothtec, Inc.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"1c695e64-efb7-41ed-bbd0-1ab0cb837b20.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"625c0f3c-bc22-4299-b008-772139353350.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"b714239c-41e1-40be-b740-25ac1e3c2c6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"ec78a840-103a-46ba-acb2-450c1522d868.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"8ca0fc3a-5773-40ce-b035-2216075bea5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"7586aca4-8e05-443b-b69f-4395f0079183.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157524,"FileName":"1ec5e6d0-a166-4ffa-8b36-7c018d1edf2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157524,"AlternateName":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157525,"Name":"Ginga Eiyū Densetsu II ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The second game in the series based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's Legend of the Galactic Heroes novels.

The story progression relies more on direct dialogue and usage of items than on \"triggering\" events by repeatedly selecting commands. It is possible to look and otherwise interact with objects by moving the arrow keys and highlighting the object on screen.

(not sure what it may stand for). The doujin circle is most known for working on games like Lucky Fighter II (which features characters from Lucky Star) and Kizuna Fighters Zero (which we have a video for). Compared to some other X68000 doujin fighters of the time, GB is of fairly good quality (unless you want to play alternatives like Chacha Fighter V)...however, it's still far from perfect.\n\n\n\nThe visuals are so-so, though the animations are a little above average for some things. I think the static backgrounds leave much to be desired (the torches on Fight 4 could have at least done something...). The music is fair; it's nothing remarkable, but it isn't a pain on the ears or anything. The game has a fairly limited roster of characters (6 normally...7 if the end boss, Sela, is playable) and it has standard options to choose from (no training mode though). You have a dodge move you can use to dodge attacks and there are super moves at low life (Think Fatal Fury Special). The main problems with GB are lack of recoil, character balance (Chickle and Mewkey have super quick recovery from many attacks for example), and many moves can grant the player an unusual amount of invincibility time...hit boxes could have been better too. While it isn't a complaint to those familiar with some of SNK's final bosses, Sela (for this game anyway) kinda has some \"SNK Boss Syndrome\" nonsense going on...with ultra fast attacks and moves that are effective in just about every way possible...though she CAN be beaten.\n\n\n\nDepending on the difficulty you choose, you can see more adult pics of the opponent you beat...though they add nothing to the story. Speaking of story, it may surprise some that there is one and it is different for each character, though the premise is the same. In the kingdom known as Tashion, a tournament is held once a year where powerful girls/women compete to win huge awards and recognition as one of the strongest and finest females in the country.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B8U-z1HlnQ","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"D.C.S.","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187956,"FileName":"91fbc48e-aed4-46f6-aa06-f4a4ee064f57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187956,"FileName":"ac8bdac0-8e0b-4307-87c5-cdc9e26c7ed7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187957,"Name":"Goku: Jouseki Shuu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A board game\\card game developed and published by Log, which was released in Japan in 1992.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"LOG","Publisher":"LOG","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187957,"FileName":"49acaa5b-4124-4e64-a55b-907dd2aea348.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157527,"Name":"Gradius","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The people of Gradius are in trouble.

Will she be able to reclaim him for herself - and if so, by what means?..\n\nThe gameplay in IF 2 is similar to that of the previous game, though the branching story line concept is somewhat deeper and more complicated.

People's Republic of China and United Kingdom signed an agreement in which they both renounced their claims over the city.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Tianren, a \"diver\" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong, he was brought up in the house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the supernatural beings from Chinese myths.\n\nIllusion City is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike most games of the genre, it has no overworld, and takes place entirely in a vast city divided into several districts. The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.\n\nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.\n\nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"TAKERU","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157541,"FileName":"3c3a4282-1f51-4353-90a8-8b3ce8cfd856.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157541,"FileName":"8b7c2ed5-2aa0-4bbe-aa7f-35649e9a0f4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157541,"FileName":"6fe03a12-db6e-4cea-8888-b6a3079c398c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157541,"FileName":"521ee038-1cb7-4ed7-bd03-eaff7926b6c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157541,"FileName":"edd853e1-be2f-4cac-aa6d-7ab9fdb8fc60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157542,"Name":"Image","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Image consists of three short episodes; each episode, in its turn, contains two different scenarios.

The first episode introduces a girl from the tennis club, the protagonist being either an older boy or a younger classmate. The second revolves around a female high school student who stays in the school after classes; the protagonist can be a male classmate or a male teacher. Finally, the third episode is dedicated to the lovely school nurse, with the protagonist taking two alternate routes to win her graces.\n\nThe gameplay usually involves selecting verbs from command menus with different options and sometimes vast sub-menus of objects. The sex scenes (and some others) are handled through a point-and-click interface, with the player selecting an appropriate command (\"Look\", \"Touch\", \"Kiss\", etc.), and clicking on an object on the screen to interact with.

All the three episodes are set in medieval/fantasy environment.\n\n    The first episode tells of a \"cursed\" treasure room somewhere on the outskirts of a town; the only one brave enough to venture there is a young hero named Recardo. In scenario A, Recardo has to find a way to defeat a demon, using objects from the treasure room; in scenario B, he has to face a female demonic creature and seduce her without getting killed in the process. Scenario A has a large turn-based battle that can be lost; the key to winning is usage of items.\n\n    The second episode stars the fighter Rush and his female companion Femir; traveling across the desert, they enter a town, and Rush decides to participate in a fighter competition. This episode differs from the other ones (and most other Japanese-style adventures) by having free movement in top-down environment. Scenario A puts the player into Rush's role; the gameplay here contains slight, mini-game-like elements of role-playing, as Rush has to win turn-based battles, gain money, and buy better weapons, equipment, and items to survive. In Scenario B, the player controls Femir. While Rush is fighting his battles, Femir investigates a strange disappearance of female warriors.\n\n    The third episode is the most traditional one, both from the point of view of story and gameplay. This rather minimalistic episode depicts a meeting between the young boy Fand and the girl Remia, who is from another town. Fand shows her around, the two have a date, and the rest of the episode evolves according to the player's decisions for both characters (Fand in Scenario A, Remia in Scenario B).\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the one implemented in the first game, with the exception of the episode-specific enhancements described above. Most of the time the player has several verbs at his disposal, sometimes with object sub-menus. Sex scenes are usually handled via a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verb commands.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Software House Parsley","Publisher":"Software House Parsley","ReleaseDate":"1993-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157543,"FileName":"ebdc7a39-6fb6-4c3d-8954-cd97fac0dc84.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157543,"AlternateName":"Image 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188091,"Name":"Imitation wa Ai Senai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Imitation wa Ai Senai is an Adventure game, developed and published by Great, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Great","Publisher":"Great","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188091,"FileName":"d381eb74-94c6-423f-900a-14394eb33a7f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188091,"FileName":"5762ecc8-c036-4438-842f-6991281d8ed7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188091,"FileName":"2653c50a-f1cc-4332-895c-14bd4660d863.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188091,"AlternateName":"Imitation Ha Ai Senai","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188092,"Name":"Imperial Force","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Imperial Force is a turn-based Strategy game, developed and published by SystemSoft, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"SystemSoft","Publisher":"SystemSoft","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188092,"FileName":"86943686-5f1f-4bb3-887b-bee59d78f1a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188092,"FileName":"b883a120-cfd6-4253-a988-a5f278bb2a26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188092,"FileName":"672d087e-f5b8-440f-abde-7648a3908709.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157545,"Name":"Inindo: Way of the Ninja","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1581, Japan.

Most of the passengers assume it was junk thrown out of a space ship; but shortly afterwards, several crew members are murdered under mysterious circumstances. Kazuya begins to see a connection to a Halley's Comet incident that happened four years ago, and realizes things are much worse than anyone else would assume...\n\nJesus II is a sequel to Jesus: Kyōfu no Bio-Monster.

Gameplay-wise, Jesus II is a Japanese-style adventure with a large amount of dialogue and very simple interaction: the player is only able to choose basic commands such as \"Examine\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", etc., without the possibility of selecting objects to interact with. Most of the game consists of visiting various locations on the ship, and talking to characters, gradually unraveling the mystery.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Enix Corporation","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157562,"FileName":"835146fb-b246-4852-969d-9d4b2be419df.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157562,"FileName":"cc66206c-d7dc-4374-b68f-a21212a53522.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157562,"FileName":"a192c791-ae57-47e5-957e-c7f7556d9d6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188149,"Name":"Jissen Billiards","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Jissen Billiards is a billiards game, developed and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188149,"FileName":"c3a6a052-e6d1-4c3f-8e8d-19119b6eeaf3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188149,"FileName":"ea7c0dd6-a94a-41cf-a964-04b41930948a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188149,"FileName":"3e74f035-3972-4c47-8087-4719f064eb1c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188153,"Name":"Jissen Igo Taikyoku: Gokichi-Kun Shokyuu Jou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Jissen Igo Taikyoku: Gokichi-Kun Shokyuu Jou is a Go simulation game, developed and published by G.A.M, which was released in Japan in 1988.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"G.A.M","Publisher":"G.A.M.","ReleaseDate":"1988-04-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188153,"FileName":"0a4bf811-0c23-47ef-b1b1-ac9a76c747f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188153,"FileName":"532d7831-0ac6-4c62-9df1-f47ec7828f2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188153,"FileName":"a05ebeb3-6180-44e4-9cc1-de9569ecb3c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188153,"AlternateName":"GoKichikun","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157563,"Name":"Joker","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Joker is set in the time period commonly known as the \"Old West\" or \"Wild West\" in the United States of America. The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called \"The Great Disaster\". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...\n\nJoker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games.

The same nightmare pursues him: he sees his sweetheart Laura calling for him, begging him to save her... Wild has to rebuild his life from scratch, but this nightmare ties him to his past... so he ventures out to look for answers once again.\n\nGameplay-wise, Joker II is pretty much identical to its predecessor.

The player can choose between any of the three scenarios, taking place during the fictional 10th to 12th centuries of Joshua's history. The earliest scenario puts the player in control of the small desert nation Rujua; in the middle one the ruler of the Principality of Ashumenia fights against the kingdom of Ishtakar; the final scenario takes place on a part of the continent occupied by the powerful Barm Empire, and the player must resist their invasion as the leader of the kingdom of Ans.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Koei's historical simulation games. Much of the interaction is menu-driven, as the player conducts interior policies, diplomacy, and military actions of the controlled state. As the ruler of a nation, the player has to keep the population happy, fortify cities, construct catapults for protection, train soldier, supply money and rations to the army, and engage in large-scale turn-based battles that take place on separate overhead screens.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Panther Software Inc.","Publisher":"Panther Software Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157565,"FileName":"a6aecac1-7fcd-4e47-9bed-1e9042583211.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190539,"Name":"Jotei Senki 1 Queen Edition","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdrBYYJTew","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Linner System","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190539,"FileName":"2a780a39-6b6a-431d-82eb-57e352d61fab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190539,"FileName":"a95c2113-875b-474d-9610-a1c5987579e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190539,"FileName":"e9ae9d05-3830-42a9-8da0-85e980057589.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190539,"FileName":"a20a0cae-7cba-4151-87ec-353c9fa5e475.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190540,"Name":"Jotei Senki 2 Legend of Heroines","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z96q5oSSnU","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Linner System","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190540,"FileName":"616ac246-4a98-41e5-b519-f3724f60bc84.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190540,"FileName":"d809323b-b47d-4944-a383-669d325cfb41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190540,"FileName":"0f54cd0a-6fda-4f15-9abe-61566f42d0a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190540,"FileName":"69e7c22c-c6c3-45ac-81b2-baf3840f9158.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190543,"Name":"Jotei Senki 3 The Queen of Fighters","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma-M1RLmRQM","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Linner System","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190543,"FileName":"bf842e6c-cce0-4982-a22c-b0d296c1a74a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190543,"FileName":"d911fbc1-c8e8-4a53-ac22-7ab89f1d85a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190543,"FileName":"4c81368a-f500-46b5-a2ee-a81b8d914cf4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190545,"Name":"Jotei Senki 4 Heroines Forever","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Linner System","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190545,"FileName":"b0d3af96-2698-4150-a91e-e60ac218c328.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190545,"FileName":"505a6271-0cb8-4c61-9a6c-dc36d139de0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190545,"FileName":"64d30e31-25dd-49a7-bc36-207c03152c88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190546,"Name":"Jumping Simon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Any other platforms have a jump rope game?

Beside empty squares, there are event squares with pictures; stopping on these raises the players' parameters. The squares can include money, fitness training, encounters with women, items, marriage, child birth, and even exotic choices as making a pact with the devil to raise a parameter.\n\nThe player can also choose to give items to a girl of his choice.

There are no separate battles where the player inputs active orders; instead, the player can opt to change the movement trajectory or tactics of a ship, watching the events unfold when the turn is over. The interface is entirely menu-driven and occupies a large portion of the screen; two other windows are dedicated to the map of the star cluster and visual depictions of ships and their battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157593,"FileName":"fb59f663-0c73-4939-b976-53f8e98577ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156926,"Name":"Kyuukyoku Tiger","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Twin Cobra is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up.

On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...\n\nLaplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_3kjQVl2_g","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157595,"FileName":"a4f7dccd-563b-41b6-82df-51166d1e9df4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157595,"FileName":"74bfde04-1150-4fb2-ac1e-c3a9b54e99d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157595,"FileName":"edb2a805-279c-4972-a182-25d5346e14df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157595,"FileName":"8dd5184e-d147-46d8-af34-03015219984e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157595,"FileName":"141579f5-7516-42dc-a3e8-52e58f46b0be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157595,"AlternateName":"Diable de Laplace","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157608,"Name":"Last Armageddon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Earth has changed.

The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective.

The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.\n\nAfter the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.\n\nBattles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Hummingbird Soft","Publisher":"Hummingbird Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188382,"FileName":"691d1b58-fbf8-4236-bff0-a60394c926f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188382,"FileName":"ee358e43-8398-415e-8ebc-3799ad4e5d8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188382,"FileName":"cf475581-40b2-4dc5-831b-4b7f2c70881b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188382,"FileName":"1f601739-e9be-49cc-b2ae-019dd54b3f4c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188382,"FileName":"3b3f9c38-3b10-440b-a36a-a8e1f8efa6ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188382,"FileName":"045c752b-0e8d-4507-9534-6a359a81bed8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188382,"AlternateName":"Lodoss Tou Senki: Haiiro no Majo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188382,"AlternateName":"Record of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157620,"Name":"Loop Eraser","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Loop Eraser is a puzzle game consisting of 120 stages. Each stage is a screen containing puzzle pieces arranged in different patterns on a screen. Each piece has a line drawn on it, and can be rotated left and right to change its direction. A line that faces downward but is not connected to another one will automatically fall down until it becomes adjacent to another line. The goal is to connect lines together under correct angles to build \"loops\", i.e. complete forms out of straight lines that encircle an area of the screen. A loop disappears once formed. A stage is solved when all the lines have been arranged into loops and are therefore removed completely from the screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Nihon Computer Club Renmei","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157620,"FileName":"18c83081-35e1-4df9-b622-ba751e71c1e5.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157620,"FileName":"d5b62c56-4bad-4a48-aa86-c97a83aba661.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157620,"FileName":"4398ba65-82ee-45b7-8084-9e37b570aedc.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157620,"FileName":"8832ed79-fcfa-43f2-a25c-1fcda085dfc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157620,"FileName":"f1f10a92-9aba-426d-b455-9a394a10d289.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157620,"FileName":"962f5065-22f9-4e00-a5e8-94d8c40650a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157621,"Name":"Loopz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\n\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\n\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.\n\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\n\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Audiogenic Software Ltd.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"5fc289a8-c371-4639-aefa-fe1bf6912b60.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"d5825922-3239-4c01-aa42-65870f52dcfc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"4ddc5a58-1319-44a7-93a9-a4fdb966034c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"70c7f867-85cb-46c1-8ec4-79e6819f933d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"392e4ef1-c38a-4d3f-bcae-95a61b116d61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"2d83f870-0390-4c41-936b-8c524bef215d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"3c8e1ea0-bd03-4c9f-bf20-053a5135488d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157621,"FileName":"e86a3670-bf3c-4939-b237-f6cde548cb52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157622,"Name":"Lords of the Rising Sun","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Japan, 12th century.

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.\n\nLand is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.\n\nLater on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.\n\nIf there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.\n\nThe main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents.\n\nYou can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Sensible Software","Publisher":"Imagineer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157639,"FileName":"834bdd22-698b-4369-8ede-05361c3ca637.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157639,"FileName":"295221b6-3cc2-4c96-b809-68477611078e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157639,"AlternateName":"Mega-Lo-Mania","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190811,"Name":"Megami De Pon","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"DCS","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190811,"FileName":"286bc6b9-a244-4c38-9abb-0a5e014b5378.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190811,"FileName":"e356c34c-a936-4e00-96d5-3ae670a7b9db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190811,"FileName":"3cf0b505-1dc2-4ec3-955f-6f417a78fbc2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190811,"FileName":"14abc1a6-54c3-48b0-ae93-470992a74a9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185635,"Name":"Meikantoku II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Meikantoku II is a Sports game, specifically a baseball management game developed and published by JDS, which was released in Japan in 1988.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"JDS","Publisher":"JDS","ReleaseDate":"1988-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185635,"FileName":"26599c09-8141-465e-b1ae-a751194002f7.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185635,"FileName":"27e10e29-4cf9-47fd-a7ee-15b10eb28365.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185635,"FileName":"77889ac9-e03e-492e-a652-5c240e3c81f9.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185635,"AlternateName":"Mei kantoku Ⅱ penanto e no michi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190813,"Name":"Memory Broken","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qAmuN96C4E","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Fukuiinchou","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190813,"FileName":"1f36bb70-ef7d-4f5e-9c56-79828808096c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190813,"FileName":"6f47d1ed-215c-47d9-8b27-16390fde6c83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190813,"FileName":"974bfade-e87a-47b2-960c-bf628c121026.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190813,"FileName":"db798b90-735d-4988-9560-4619cbbd7f80.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157640,"Name":"Mercury: The Prime Master ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"When evolution reached its highest stage, the human species have emerged. Eventually, the humans became divided into three races: Fantura, Apocrypha, and Ende. The first two were proficient in all things magical, while the Ende civilization was technically the most advanced one, holding the secrets to robot construction and building beautiful cities in the skies.\n\nFor many years, the three civilizations co-existed in peace. But an internal revolution in the Fantura countries led to a change of regime. The new leaders of Fantura invaded Ende, trying to get hold of their technological secrets. A young man named Chrom, who grew up in one of Ende's celestial cities, discovers that his mother belongs to the Apocrypha race. His mixed heritage and mysterious past are the key to the world's salvation.\n\nDespite its isometric perspective and the lack of anime-style touch in its graphics, Mercury: The Prime Master is a traditional Japanese RPG with all the typical ingredients: the party of heroes roam the world map, visiting cities to buy equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based style. Characters with magical civilization background have access to magical spells, and Chrom is also able to activate a robot to help the heroes in battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Maxima","Publisher":"Maxima","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157640,"FileName":"95fa230f-2dfd-449b-8892-c8e885dc5be7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157640,"FileName":"e9bd0929-51b2-4a01-b258-3b30d90a9741.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157640,"FileName":"d385067a-3537-4766-9cc7-9889bd9cfe05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157640,"FileName":"6b502949-387b-4349-a331-2c97329a44cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157641,"Name":"Metal Eye","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Metal Eye, the player takes the role of a young weapons expert named Findhill. His father was apparently involved in a project that dealt with creating artificial life forms. But recently he has disappeared without a trace. Findhill remained alone, in a small town surrounded by vicious monsters. He wants to become a hunter, just like his father once was, to get rid of the monsters roaming the wilderness, and get to the bottom of his father's disappearance and his mysterious project.\n\nThe game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG: Findhill and his companions, who join the party as dictated by the course of the story, wander around a vast world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective. The party can carry different types of weapons, including various guns (rifles, shotguns, etc.) with expendable bullets. Weapons and armor are shared by all the characters and need not be equipped on individual combatants. The player can also purchase robotic fighters (called \"Metals\" in the game) in shops, who would then join the party and participate in battles, controlled by the AI. There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Elf Co.

He brings it to the old white dragon Yoshua, who tells him that a powerful protective artifact has been stolen, and the fateful hour has come to Akranis... with the help of his dragon Sarken, Kain has to restore peace and save Akranis and the dragon race.\n\nThe game is a rather unusual example of a side-scrolling action game, in which the player controls a dragon. Sarken is able to fly in any direction, but so are the enemies in the game, most of which are other dragons. The dragon has a HP bar which is depleted when he is damaged by enemy attacks or traps.

The hero is accompanied by another character, and both participate in combat. With time the hero and his companion learn magical spells. Dungeons also contain areas where weapons and items can be purchased.\n\nThe game contains scenes with nudity and erotic images (though nothing \"hardcore\").

The player can either go through the battles of each campaign in a linear fashion (Campaign Mode), or choose between different battles (Scenario Mode); the latter includes two-player gameplay as well.\n\nThe player may assign and customize various pilots before each battle. The battles themselves are predominantly tactical, consisting mainly of navigation and attacking, without resource management. Units may consist of space ships, infantry, droids, mechas, etc. An automatic battle between two units ensues when any of them chooses to attack the other. There are also light role-playing elements such as levels for individual units.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Family Soft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Brother Kougyou","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188454,"FileName":"f9e85bdf-c931-4218-b928-5af3fff31af6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188454,"FileName":"eae2cef8-6851-45ae-b0f5-c889906a0dfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188454,"FileName":"e84c71c0-617c-4146-ab9c-57d9f0b03d53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190907,"Name":"Mogura Attacker","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"A game of virtual whack-a-mole.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Project Makkusu","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190907,"FileName":"66fa1786-6ea9-4278-870a-e4949d13dd1d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190907,"FileName":"64ccb760-967e-47bc-8ca9-fe4dc5bddc5b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190907,"FileName":"625b222b-dcc6-42bd-9301-d17cc8186338.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190907,"FileName":"11988d41-ed05-4874-a003-ce7be87204f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190908,"Name":"Mokona In Space","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"A cute-em-up game in space.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"68 Bank","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190908,"FileName":"738f286e-410f-4382-9c32-2a05025eda2a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190908,"FileName":"fa4be6f3-f592-422b-9137-b48272a1ddfa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190908,"FileName":"faf8d583-680b-4c99-8a0b-410fc21e9496.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190908,"FileName":"01671ad7-2656-4c6d-84a8-1b7a9983cdbb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190909,"Name":"Molo-Q","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Login Soft","Publisher":"Login Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190909,"FileName":"3e3478a6-3229-47ab-8079-e9d754333077.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190909,"FileName":"74863277-0648-485f-937f-19bee96956f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190909,"FileName":"e1d4293a-56ae-4d83-ac45-af628ce23c5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190909,"FileName":"4875091e-c4ed-4512-ab6a-d3efc6d593e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":190909,"AlternateName":"モロQ","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":156279,"Name":"Momotarou Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The legend of Momotarō belongs to the most popular ones in Japanese and Asian folklore.

When you jump, you can break a tile to the point where it collapses, making it easier for opponents to fall down the gap that will be left there.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Micomsoft","ReleaseDate":"1988-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156936,"FileName":"1ccb6e08-8f19-494c-8d0e-b375e627a95a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156936,"FileName":"6bdb9fa0-c935-4819-9bf6-4384df0f46a1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156936,"FileName":"3f513e71-b691-460c-84bb-8330edd53e42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156936,"FileName":"43daaea9-dad8-4206-9f5c-58d82527e118.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156936,"FileName":"6aef19ec-bf5e-4df1-a0b3-19ea67b0cf4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157646,"Name":"Mugen Senshi Valis II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Rogles, the tyrant who wanted to gain control over the three worlds in the universe, was defeated by Yuko, an ordinary Japanese teenager who was chosen to become the heroic Valis Soldier.

Yuko fights and jumps her way through enemies and platform structures, acquiring various power-ups during the course of the game. Various weapons and armor can be found in the stages and equipped on a separate screen. Weapons have their own unique ranged patterns and are always attached to Yuko's default sword attack. Different types of armor may increase Yuko's hit points, offense, and defense ratings.\n\nYuko can also acquire and execute special attacks and techniques, such as for example an ability that freezes all the enemies on screen for a limited amount of time. These deplete a separate bar that can be filled by collecting colored orbs left by enemies. Two of the six stages control like side-scrolling shoot-em-ups, allowing Yuko to fly in any direction.\n\nThe Sharp X68000 version features improved graphics, voice acting during the intro, reduced difficulty level (particularly for boss battles), and allows the player to save the game between the stages.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Renovation Game","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157646,"FileName":"9dc9e6ef-f207-44ba-8d8b-22881509e5ca.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157646,"FileName":"88d3ef95-c6e6-471b-b9af-62663e8e4f72.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157646,"FileName":"b5b27f20-b37b-4333-b172-defb6d06687b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157646,"FileName":"8c48e310-53ee-46ce-9de8-4ad6da88e2b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157646,"FileName":"aa3541a7-8b5e-4395-afb0-7216a1e67956.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157646,"AlternateName":"Valis II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157647,"Name":"Murder Club DX","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Murder Club is an adventure game with simulation elements.

The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.\n\nThe game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.\n\nThere are two scenarios available in the game:\n\n    Warlords: 1560 A.D.\n    The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.\n\n    Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.\n    The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. \n\nSamurai\nThe game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief.\n\nEach samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level).\n\nStrategy\nThe game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"0fc46ae1-a61f-4f5b-bb77-d9064bfe0fce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"fd217821-da11-47b2-9661-b0dbc241aab8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"243b3ee7-9bfd-4171-a4d1-f7a65db42539.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"247ed046-59d5-42e9-b180-533efa182c79.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"8663707a-528d-4b17-9da1-2842ecebc235.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"d4e4583a-a3ea-4da0-bed1-b707e4e42668.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"FileName":"0c5a0a2e-0506-443a-a264-152c684381ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186870,"AlternateName":"Nobunaga No Yabou Sengoku Gunyuuden","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"AlternateName":"Nobunaga no Yabō: Sengoku-gunyūden","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186870,"AlternateName":"Nobunaga's Ambition II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":186869,"Name":"Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkokuban","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku (\"Warring States\") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nNobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\n\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1988-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186869,"FileName":"12a7d79e-42db-4d1e-9a5d-cece342d971f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186869,"FileName":"677d55aa-e4ab-4022-9ea3-3ca180830152.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186869,"FileName":"ad945cd5-b488-4123-be31-e149e3335737.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186869,"FileName":"862eaa21-c404-460b-8941-c6dfa32e520d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186869,"FileName":"2c244a7d-e370-4385-b105-25d5867f7e1a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186869,"FileName":"5a44f51f-4e01-466e-b77e-af6163f94192.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186869,"AlternateName":"Nobunaga no Yabō: Zenkokuban","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186869,"AlternateName":"Nobunaga's Ambition","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186869,"AlternateName":"Nobunaga No Yabou Zenkokuhan","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":191189,"Name":"Noriko Tobimasu","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"A rope skipping game.

However, when a ship sent to the Skull Island disappeared without trace, Scandor's inhabitants realized a new threat was rising...\n\nPhantasie IV: The Birth of Heroes is the fourth entry in the RPG series Phantasie, and the only one that was released exclusively for Japanese computers. Gameplay-wise and visually, the game is very similar to the previous installments. The player creates a party of adventurers (up to six active combatants, including the series' trademark \"random creatures\", such as ogres, minotaurs, lizardmen, etc.), which then roams the top-down world-map, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. Battles allow specific commands such as \"Thrust\", \"Parry\", \"Throw\", etc., and - similarly to the third game - placement of the characters in rows on the battle screen.\n\nA new feature is the possibility to choose parents for the characters the player creates. They can both belong to the same race, or produce an offspring in a mixed marriage - which, naturally, influences the newborn's parameters, affinities, etc. Theoretically, it is possible to create a party that consists entirely of children born to troll fathers and gnoll mothers; however, these \"random creatures\" (unlike the privileged races such as humans, dwarves, and elves) can only be either thieves or fighters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"StarCraft, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157655,"FileName":"363ba780-6ae0-4389-bf81-38f04e4f7383.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157655,"FileName":"1ed5c391-fb08-49a8-ad64-519b7f60c6f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157655,"FileName":"34f68f3e-cff3-448a-b4b0-8e102727c1ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157655,"FileName":"caa65dc6-21ec-4c24-bf0d-bd3838cbbd39.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157655,"FileName":"30cc11e9-b5ff-49d6-9b59-9295bb4dcacb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157655,"FileName":"3a872324-6942-4fc2-9863-b024ef212261.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157656,"Name":"Pias","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hiroshi and Mayumi grew up together.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"The Assembly Line","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157657,"FileName":"31ae41ee-e753-4e37-8ee3-db83d9ebae48.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157657,"FileName":"43cc52a6-f6ea-4bcc-a79e-ec3a5d81786b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157657,"FileName":"0a8bdbc0-ccbf-4bf1-bf76-69728ccd7894.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157657,"FileName":"49ae4208-2057-47e4-afdb-87aedd1d532b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":191086,"Name":"Pipyan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pipyan is a Puzzle game, developed by M.N.M Software and published by Brother Kougyou, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBoqHV3pyO0","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"M.N.M Software","Publisher":"Brother Kougyou","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":191086,"FileName":"563a2926-491d-4737-87cb-b1e87196eb38.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":191086,"FileName":"5b283227-8152-4ad2-8a90-1fb06579198a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":191086,"FileName":"23d560e0-a2f8-429f-818d-77b073ee65ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":191086,"FileName":"c0a05922-5401-4f94-b7d4-9135ee3ab1ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":191086,"AlternateName":"パイピヤン","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188527,"Name":"Pitapat","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pitapat is a Puzzle game, developed by Fill-In Cafe and published by Victor Interactive Software, which was released in Japan in 1992.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-nol6NDyNc","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Fill-In Cafe","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188527,"FileName":"b6cd92c3-b814-48f0-a2f0-abfcbd73677c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188527,"FileName":"7669aeb1-79cd-41fc-8804-1eb1a8898c87.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188527,"FileName":"922d69e6-9dbc-424c-81a6-ec664b515594.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":191172,"Name":"Pizza Busters","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Stop Kurihara before he completes his pizza delivery task.

Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\nPrince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre.

Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.\n\nThe Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies.

Just as in Princess Maker, the player has to make schedules for the girl, comprised out of various activities. These include part-time jobs of various (not necessarily lewd) kinds, studying, resting, taking a trip, etc. Such activities increase the girl's parameters, making her more attractive. It is also possible to buy items and clothes and outfit the girl with them. Once the player feels that his protegee is ready, a meeting with a client can be arranged.

In story mode (which is based on characters from Compile's RPG series Madō Monogatari), the player controls Arle Nadja (Silvana in the English translation of the arcade version), a young sorceress, whose goal is to defeat Satan. To do so, she has to win 12 battles against his minions until she can meet him in a final confrontation. The game offers an extra training mode against three lesser opponents, as well as the ability to start from level 4 of the main game.\n\nDuring a match, pairs of puyos fall down from the top of the screen into each player's field. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to arrange puyos of the same color into patterns of at least four, with horizontal or vertical (but no diagonal) connections. Doing so removes them from the field (with any unconnected puyos falling down) while at the same time sending garbage blocks into the opponent's field. Creating patterns of more than four, several different patterns at the same time, or chain reactions creates more garbage blocks. The garbage blocks can only be removed by creating patterns adjacent to them. The player whose playing field reaches the top first loses. In single-player mode, the falling speed of the puyos increases level by level and each of the enemies plays in a unique style.\n\nThe home ports also add an endless single-player mode, in which there is no opponent (and thus no garbage blocks) and one simply plays for a high score, similar to the MSX/Famicom version.\n\nUnique to the Game Gear version is an additional quest mode. Similar to the mission mode of the original MSX/Famicom version, it presents a series of pre-filled playing fields with a specific task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color. Progress is saved via passwords.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"SPS","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-25T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157669,"FileName":"20966bc5-617d-4589-b1d6-1a2c16d68119.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157669,"FileName":"724ed173-a841-4171-8616-66b748f660e3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157669,"FileName":"57af4454-b83a-4d76-80a0-db779d5a1b59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157669,"FileName":"24ead109-6e2d-4bc9-9131-536673bc99bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157669,"FileName":"756855c9-fa64-4f19-9383-fd3ec2c6ed51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151468,"Name":"Puzznic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design.

A German pilot named Michael Ilgner accidentally steers his plane into a mysterious vortex during the battle. He is then transported to the magical parallel world of Quintia, where he is requested by humans and other peaceful races to use the powers of his aircraft to defeat horrifying monsters that were unleashed upon the world.\n\nQuintia Road is an anime-style fantasy adventure game. The gameplay is quite straightforward, requiring minimal input from the player and offering no puzzles or other challenges. The player is normally expected to repeatedly select various verb commands (such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) from a text menu. There are no objects lists to combine these commands with. Story advancement is linear and only a few instances offer traveling choices.\n\nThere are a few scripted turn-based battles in the game, which allow the player to select various types of attacks; however, these battles evolve in a prescribed fashion and the player's choices have little to no impact on the results.

You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.\n\nThe R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called \"The Force\", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).\n\nThe stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems.

These must be removed by matching pairs, but only tiles which are visible and have a space to the left or right can be removed.\n\nThis release in the Activision's Shanghai series includes three games along with the Classic Shanghai. In The Great Wall, the tiles are stacked vertically, and fall when lower tiles are removed, a lá Tetris. In Beijing, gaps are created to slide groups of tiles along. The Golden Tile sees two players attempt to clear a set layout at once. The Triple-theme continues with three game modes: Solitaire, 2-player \"Pandamonium\", and Arcade.

One day he was taking a stroll with his girlfriend and the two followed a strange cat to a mysterious castle. There, they met an old man who said he was Fermata, the court magician of the Kingdom of Nyuckel located in a parallel dimension where magic dominates over technology. A great war is taking place there. Erion, prince of Nyuckel, was cursed, and his soul transmigrated into Tooru's body. Taking the role of the prince, Tooru must command ten female officers and their armies and repel the invaders.\n\nShangrlia (sic) is a turn-based tactical game. The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order. Each of them transfers the player to a different location (alternating between urban, dungeon-like, and rural areas) where a tactical battle takes place. Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority.\n\nThe battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters.\n\nAfter each round of victory, the female general removes an item of her clothing. The final result for each general is an erotic picture with partial nudity and implicit sexual scene, but no explicit images.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Elf Co.

However, dark forces have emerged again. Commanding hellish creatures, they managed to capture the top female generals of the Hyunckel army, sealing them in special devices resembling eggs. Only three generals remained free, and they must liberate their companions and re-capture the land.\n\nShangrlia 2 is a turn-based tactical game and a sequel to Shangrlia. The goal of the game is to capture castles occupied by the enemy, freeing commanders on the way. Unlike in the first game, the player is no longer allowed to choose any battle right from the beginning and is at first restricted to only three battles. Same applies to characters and unit types: in the beginning the player can only control three types of fighters, and other characters are unlocked gradually.\n\nThere are fifteen unit types altogether (as opposed to ten in the previous game). New units include different types of horsemen, chariots, winged horses, golem commanders, etc. In addition, each unit comes in three variations, e.g. catapults and cannons are considered the same type, variants of which can be unlocked by completing battles and freeing them. Each unit gradually advances in strength, and must reach a \"master\" level to be actively selected by the player and positioned on the battle. This time, enemy units are mostly completely different and mainly consist of various monster types such as skeletons, minotaurs, dragons, undead mages, assorted hell creatures etc.\n\nWinning battles gradually unlocks erotic pictures of the female generals. The sexual content is noticeably heavier than in the first game and includes non-traditional types of sex as well.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Elf Co.

However, one of the magicians betrayed the Guild and used the portal for his own gain, releasing hostile creatures known as Lucifer Hawk onto Earth. Twenty-four years later, a special all-female unit known as Attacked Mystification Police was formed to combat the enemy.\n\nCase: Titanic is based on the manga and anime Silent Möbius. It presents an original episode that involves the sighting of a strange ship in the clouds above Tokyo. Closer inspection reveals that the ship appears to be identical to the famous RMS Titanic that sank in the Atlantic Ocean in 1912. The game's nameless male protagonist boards the ship along with Rally, Kiddy, Nami and other heroines from the manga in order to investigate this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon.\n\nThe gameplay is done in Japanese-style, puzzle-less adventure format. The entire game is set on the Titanic. The player is generally free to visit various areas of the ship in any order, though access to certain locations is restricted and necessary events must be triggered in order to gain it. The commands Look, Talk and Move are used on most screens, and there is no inventory management.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157694,"FileName":"9d98ea61-91a2-4b51-926f-f4bb9c416f96.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157694,"FileName":"be2e2bd5-ddca-446b-9e08-b1dda847e5bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157694,"FileName":"00d5ca69-e990-46d9-a6c9-c8be8ba01044.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157694,"FileName":"6c2f50e8-dd08-4186-9039-0087d801f486.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157694,"FileName":"a2734255-a513-4787-9715-05e21024c0f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157694,"AlternateName":"Silent Moebius","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190285,"Name":"Silk Road 2","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"The sequel to Sprite Road is radically different than its predecessor.

Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Wave Train","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"cf68a948-a818-4703-aa12-35bf4f4ac7b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"e4d1538c-cc9f-4bcc-b262-010f9f4d6415.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"0444da9a-76aa-4c17-b423-3b2ee692aac8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"2cf190b8-3e0c-4ea0-bc29-a11fa80c1939.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"cae3b118-9f07-4a1a-8237-3b6e10b1064d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"da6db5f3-3235-4cb7-b9aa-8a0699ef0339.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"b2478dd4-6aa1-45ac-bef7-3cad48b4cfd7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159970,"FileName":"7a93f38b-9e9f-4c84-ad71-b0e8e9faeb5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153599,"Name":"Space Soldier","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153599,"FileName":"f5fbfff5-520c-4f99-a7ed-c991f0d99602.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153536,"Name":"Spanner X Endless Fire","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153536,"FileName":"c1503521-84e5-49fc-aa6c-86769c7aafa2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192106,"Name":"Special Tenanmon","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Let your troops get safely to the bottom, while shooting the enemy forces.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnAs5cc2jtI","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Pekin Net","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":192106,"FileName":"cce99fad-4809-45d1-90df-ef5445eeca42.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192106,"FileName":"5cf23d50-0927-46c2-beea-2124eacbb68a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192106,"FileName":"85422a7e-84e9-4685-b37b-d25a47f33b21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192106,"FileName":"bd182535-dd81-43e7-990a-336ca88139c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187020,"Name":"Spindizzy II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness.

The human Federation wished to develop peaceful relations, but there were those who did not trust the Galaxy Alliance, and mounted a fierce rebellion. The rebellion was quickly put down, but its leader, Geist Needman, went missing. Having expanded too quickly, the Federation was unable to maintain control over its territories, and more remote regions quickly soon to rebel in great numbers.\n\nIn the middle of this, an unknown group called VOID began to amass power at a frightening rate, and unafraid of involving civilians, they became known as the \"dark destroyers\". It appears that a dark age in space is about to begin. However, there were those brave few still willing to stand up against such evil: Hunters. This is the story of Brian Light, one of those hunters.\n\nStar Cruiser is a 3D action game with light RPG elements from the creators of Wibarm.

Players select a location on their interplanetary map and warp to it. Locations that can be flown to include spots that contain enemy clusters and bases. Players have to be aware of the enemy locations, as the enemies can attack and destroy planets and bases if they come close enough to them.\n\nWhen players reach an enemy cluster they have to seek out the enemy ships to engage in battle with, and then blast them away with either laser fire or photon torpedoes. Once all the enemies in a sector are defeated, the player can move on to another location. Firing shots and moving costs the spaceship energy. If the ship is running low on energy, the player has the option to visit a base to refill their energy. Bases can also repair the ships' radar, computer, and engine if they have become to damaged from enemy attacks. The ship also contains a rechargeable shield. Getting hit will temporarily drain the shield, while avoiding enemy fire for a while will refill it.\n\nThe game features three modes of play. Training mode and Command mode are easier versions of the Adventure mode. They mainly try to get the player prepared for the Adventure mode. The Adventure mode features the most groups of enemies that have to be dealt with and requires the most planning to defend the planets successfully. The Adventure mode also features an optional objective which involves collecting keys from seven different planets in order to access a hidden final planet.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAcAcY2_wVY","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Dempa Shinbunsha","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"4990bd34-bc87-4186-8bcf-ea9b2a375a29.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"a139b335-d6cb-48fd-81f4-c2dec8a3339f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"dbe24574-e458-4f58-9534-8e04c90622cb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"7b0b6817-1f7c-44c0-a7f9-1b4442776704.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"23707f6e-ef8e-47a9-a1f4-6b6462030c42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"62aeddc8-1911-48eb-b293-1f4721d05f07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143588,"FileName":"71e39692-8c64-4016-b918-4fa92aa3dbcc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157706,"Name":"Star Mobile","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Star Mobile is a real-time puzzle game.

Like the other D.P.S. games, it is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.\n\nThe scenarios in this game include:\n\nA rather disturbing tale entitled Maria and Kanpan, which focuses on a young female robot specialist who falls asleep and is sexually \"explored\" by one of the robots. The player can view the events from either the girl's or the robot's point of view.\n\nAn adventurous scenario, which depicts the dangers encountered by a young couple in a tropical forest populated by local tribes. The two are imprisoned and have to find a way to escape. The player can choose to control either the heroine or the hero.\n\nA scenario with sci-fi elements, involving a famous female space pirate named Camelia, who raids a space ship together with her pretty lieutenant. The story varies according to the player's choice to control Camelia herself, or a male soldier on the ship who captures Camelia's lieutenant.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are \"neutral\", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered \"bad\" by the game, leading to Game Over.

The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.\n\nThe game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.\n\nDifferent units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"SystemSoft","Publisher":"SystemSoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157708,"FileName":"e7c7c5a9-7a9b-42e7-94be-4ad7946ac329.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157708,"FileName":"81c57267-f491-4024-97c1-9d6fab202a45.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157708,"FileName":"ca72f1bc-e71f-4f92-bf40-eec58a6502b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157708,"FileName":"57390037-84c5-4f28-b12c-6e84356b8220.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157708,"FileName":"0981068f-79d0-47cd-b69d-7805b4fd6f32.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189027,"Name":"Super Daisenryaku 68K: Map Collection","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super Daisenryaku 68K: Map Collection is a Strategy game expansion for  Super Daisenryaku 68K, developed and published by SystemSoft, which was released in Japan in 1989.

Old legends tell of a lone brave hero who saved Hydlide from the imminent threat of doom - the evil demon Varalys. Since then, the people of Hydlide have lived through centuries of peace. But one dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of the depths of Hydlide. The next morning, strange doors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, but were never seen again. From that day on, unusual events and disasters began to take place. Huge cracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands, floods wiped out entire villages. And then the monsters came. The Hydlide council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A wise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young man who could save Hydlide from the grave danger. This young man is you...\n\nSuper Hydlide (originally entitled Hydlide 3: The Space Memories) is the third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply \"bumping\" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease.

The presentation is far more straightforward compared to Koei's game, and there is a focus on strategic use of a small number of units, much like a game of chess. The player may only control a dozen or so units at any given time, and can order them to advance, retreat, and attack as necessary.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"SystemSoft","Publisher":"SystemSoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157718,"FileName":"2c795d9c-1b06-4e42-b8d3-9d2ebf923923.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157718,"FileName":"ea25309d-986d-40e7-9043-708e4bb330d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157718,"FileName":"95093dc4-6bbf-40ff-8cc7-bd9c42eaf110.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157718,"FileName":"52417c43-5d82-4a38-a5e8-1936dd6024ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":157718,"AlternateName":"Tenka Tōitsu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189116,"Name":"Tenkyuhai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tenkyuhai is a Dominoes Board game, developed and published by Panther Software, which was released in Japan in 1989.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Panther Software","Publisher":"Panther Software","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189116,"FileName":"94b17327-7798-49fa-92b6-36f52dbd9edd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189116,"FileName":"9c97e9a5-c98a-41ba-98c8-89115e5aaedc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189116,"FileName":"fd370762-8e15-4339-960c-cb7eeec96997.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189116,"AlternateName":"Tenkyuuhai","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189117,"Name":"Tenkyuuhai Special: Tougen no Utage","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tenkyuuhai Special: Tougen no Utage is a dominoes board game, developed by Panther Software and published by Brother Kougyou, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Studio Panther","Publisher":"Brother Kōgyō","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189117,"FileName":"62071a38-bfe7-4c81-97fb-7ccd2ab094cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189117,"FileName":"67cfbc44-4745-42f9-b310-4106d615d819.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189117,"AlternateName":"Tenkyuhai Special: Tōgen no Utage","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157719,"Name":"Tenshin Ranma","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Angels and demons have a disagreement concerning the human race.

Shortly thereafter, a teenage girl was found in the nearby forest. She doesn't remember anything except her name, Blon-Win, but apparently there is a connection between her and the strange aircraft. Blon-Win eventually finds out that she possesses unique powers, and joins the 4th Unit, a team of bionic soldiers who combat crime.\n\nThe 4th Unit is a Japanese-style adventure game. The emphasis is on advancing the story by triggering events rather than puzzle-solving. The list of commands, however, is fairly long, and includes (beside the standard \"Examine\", \"Talk\", and \"Go\") also verbs for taking objects, using items, affirmative and negative responses during certain dialogues, as well as the unique commands \"Fight\" and \"Rescue\". Each of these commands can be combined with a person or an object displayed on-screen by highlighting it.\n\nAt certain points during the story Blon-Win and her allies will have to fight enemies. The fights are turn-based and consist of simple menu-based choices of attacks such as punching, kicking, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"a6ced399-3e5e-41b5-8dc3-89c265050c1a.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"e429f201-ae75-4a19-9b9b-0ddaa5db4f8e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"fc510c64-a881-49a8-a1e1-dfb4de409638.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"6b83e691-792d-41c6-862d-24d97f901e54.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"5f203999-7160-44f3-8311-4cd9152a643f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"c4249409-246b-444f-b14e-aa8f010e6174.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156894,"FileName":"c57b211f-781a-4340-beaa-109073eac0e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156886,"Name":"The 4th Unit 2","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The 4th Unit 2 is a direct sequel to The 4th Unit.

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.\n\nIf Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs.\n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"SPS","Publisher":"Sharp","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157632,"FileName":"27d56251-c44d-4d5f-a5b4-814b2f93a6f7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157632,"FileName":"7ffb4b1a-83ba-4538-9a59-9c6c314e822d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157671,"Name":"The Queen of Duellist Gaiden α+","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Queen of Duellist Gaiden α+ is a versus fighting game.

Some of the boxes also contain punch traps that can stun you or time bombs that will blow you up if you do not get away. If hit by an enemy, you lose your outer clothes and are reduced to underclothes. If you get hit again, you lose a life, but you can look around for a new set of clothes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QTZqChfdL0","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"R.G.B.","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":192344,"FileName":"0d104c82-8692-4b62-865a-a94fc4b316cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192344,"FileName":"6b16876a-3ce0-4984-bd82-1bcf01cf61ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192344,"FileName":"ffc2736c-36d3-4ee0-ab3f-af50d5bacd94.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189126,"Name":"Trilogy: Kyuuki Youka Shinden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Trilogy: Kyuuki Youka Shinden is an Adventure game, developed by Hard and published by Gundeck, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"HARD","Publisher":"Gundeck","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189126,"FileName":"d4463412-84ce-4fd6-99e5-e38a4dc3f662.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189126,"FileName":"aa216efa-5a11-4176-93b5-e528f2a3cf19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189126,"FileName":"02223e9f-163c-4ae8-97b0-6a2ccf4b3d19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189126,"AlternateName":"Trilogy Kuki Ayakashiden","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189127,"Name":"Tritorn Final","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tritorn Final is a Role-Playing game, developed by Lee Way Corporation and published by Zainsoft, which was released in Japan in 1989.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Lee Way Corporation","Publisher":"Zainsoft","ReleaseDate":"1989-07-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189127,"FileName":"f5566f2e-7189-4a71-a2c1-dcdcb76665d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189127,"FileName":"47250177-a0d3-4390-9e24-1f01bed43809.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189127,"FileName":"0baff92c-9c20-4ae0-bd9d-21e6ec019022.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189128,"Name":"Tsuukai Gag Adventure: Narutomaki Hichou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tsuukai Gag Adventure: Narutomaki Hichou is an Adventure, Eroge, Visual novel game, developed by Lucifer Soft and published by Zenryuutuu, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"Lucifer Soft","Publisher":"Zenryuutuu","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189128,"FileName":"11a68af3-7afa-43c5-bd8f-2748e3adb557.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189128,"FileName":"6b5e7d82-b4eb-4dac-863f-b142e0b1398f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189128,"FileName":"9a838641-9dab-4b47-b1dd-20195a45a39d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189128,"AlternateName":"Tsūkai Gag Adventure: Narutomaki Hichō","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157724,"Name":"Tunnels & Trolls: Crusaders of Khazan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game is based on the pen & paper RPG Tunnels & Trolls.\n\nAfter a four hundred year long war, humans and monsters finally signed a peace treaty, and harmony returned to the Dragon Land - but not for long.

Thus, a young Japanese man and his few male allies embark on a quest to defeat the aliens by having sex with them.\n\nThe fourth installment of the Twilight Zone series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. Like the three previous games, it is an RPG where the enemies are exclusively semi-naked girls and most battle commands correspond to sexual actions. Unlike the preceding games, navigation is done in top-down view, though the battles remain first-person. Up to three characters will join the protagonist and take part in combat. There is no world map and the game is built in a fairly linear way, with only a few friendly areas where enemies do not appear.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Great Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Great Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188105,"FileName":"7e2f1452-0fc1-4812-b2d0-57963013c30a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188105,"FileName":"06ec20f0-b2dd-46b8-93bc-b738affa371b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188105,"FileName":"8eaa2242-baff-470e-8395-9e9e345cce26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188105,"FileName":"88c8b977-793c-4ba2-87f8-a4d5bc46fe16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188105,"FileName":"a2ccac4f-28c4-4f9c-b942-ac718a5465c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188105,"AlternateName":"Twilight Zone IV: Tokubetsuhen","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":192345,"Name":"Twin Soul","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Twin Soul ツインソウル is a doujin shoot'em up for the sharp x68000 developed by Login in 1989.

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.\n\nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.\n\nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.\n\nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.\n\nThe FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187022,"FileName":"2ad1097b-0328-4f44-b8e7-b40edfa34797.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187022,"FileName":"271aa7e1-8968-4063-abce-6d113c1dbc49.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187022,"FileName":"862e7460-cdcc-468f-bec1-01d9b8873e30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187022,"FileName":"bc7096f9-ee13-4298-b9d2-d0df593e97e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187022,"AlternateName":"Ultima IV: Avatar no Tankyu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":126599,"Name":"Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.\n\nUltima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to four.\n\nAdditional challenges include navigating characters through the Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar; inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and others.\n\nThe game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a day/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping. Dialogues with NPCs have been enhanced, featuring more unique and detailed conversation topics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufOcMTBE52g","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126599,"FileName":"88a14bc4-b785-4e65-874b-b1d8022a8713.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126599,"FileName":"4430e3b1-e7a5-4143-98c5-31b53d42df33.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126599,"FileName":"9b255315-9600-45ee-a71e-398893523c6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126599,"FileName":"1ac169a1-4147-4608-bebf-88a94c351744.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157726,"Name":"Ultima VI: The False Prophet ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Several years after having restored Lord British to his rightful position as the monarch of Britannia, the Avatar is captured by demon-like creatures and placed on a sacrificial altar.

As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.\n\nUltima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no \"world map\" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved.\n\nThe interface has been re-designed, the original key-bound commands co-existing with selectable command icons and mouse-based interaction. The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters.

Some important topics may be highlighted during text display, to facilitate further dialogue, which requires the player to type the desired conversation topics.\n\nLike in the predecessors, the player is free to explore the game world from the beginning of the game, and visit locations in any order.

One of these people was a coal miner named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.\n\nWhat distinguishes Chelnov: Atomic Runner from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.\n\nWhile the level design and enemy placement is identical in the later released Genesis (and subsequently Wii) version, the graphics have been significantly changed: now each level is based on a ancient human civilization and the enemies (including bosses) are replaced. Also all references to atomic explosions have been removed from the background story. Now Chernov is the son of a scientist. The evil Deathtarians, who claim to be the original population of the Earth and want to control this planet, murdered his father and abducted his sister. Chelnov takes a special suit made by his father, which give him super-human powers and make him an \"Atomic Runner\". The Deathtarians caught and imprisoned him, but he broke out of the prison and is now on the run...","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Data East Corporation","Publisher":"Micomsoft","ReleaseDate":"1993-01-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"32303a13-0d74-4ccd-ac78-e4eaa949c8b8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"e70f5995-c0fd-4f60-a353-626d9cc18b57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"985f3cfd-bee5-482b-a461-be11ba97d6f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"a9a14526-c539-43d0-9dab-6684b087d073.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"81b49fed-445b-4709-8766-1924a12b4b82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"90ae809d-643a-416b-a8c4-0a8fe70dc8b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"1cde493c-3ad2-4eb1-9da4-1f0bffb1d14b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156957,"FileName":"e5520e3f-7ae8-4e6c-9839-a4a2e30ba3bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156957,"AlternateName":"Anthology: Vol. 2: Atomic Runner: Chelnov","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156957,"AlternateName":"Atomic Runner Chelnov","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":157705,"Name":"Video Game Anthology Vol. 3: Star Force","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are a spaceship pilot shooting enemy spacecraft and ground targets.

He returns to our world and asks his friend, the natural museum curator Dr. Rafkin, to analyze it. A reporter named Jimmy Malone is eager to cover the story and joins the two. However, the experiments triggers a gigantic explosion, and the group is teleported to a seemingly otherwordly place known as the Valley of Eodon, where native tribes with Mesoamerican and African characteristics co-exist with Neanderthals, dinosaurs, as well as sentient reptile and insect species.\n\nThe Avatar befriends Aiela, the daughter of the chieftain of the Kurak tribe. However, she is soon abducted by her belligerent suitor from the tribe of Urali, who knocks the Avatar out. When he wakes up, he realizes that his friends are gone as well. Now the hero of Britannia must explore the new world, find his friends, rescue Aiela, and eventually help the locals sort out their differences, uniting them against a common threat.\n\nWorlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire is a side story in the Ultima series. It is made with the Ultima VI engine, and is very similar to that game visually and gameplay-wise. Like Ultima VI, the game is set in a seamless graphical world, and offers many objects to interact with and combine, party management, and turn-based combat. As in the other Ultima games, the player is free to roam the world and visit almost every location from the onset. Like Ultima VI, there is more emphasis on exploration, obtaining vital information through dialogue, and finding or creating a variety of items than on combat.\n\nSome features have been slightly simplified compared to Ultima VI. There are less spells and only one companion who can use them with the help of special totems. Most characters start at relatively high levels and can only gain a few more during the course of the game. The Savage Empire is the first game in the series to use cutscenes during some of the key plot events.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1993-08-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157741,"FileName":"fc6daf38-de4c-4567-80c4-4ad9f5df0f4a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157741,"FileName":"ec40e879-52b4-412d-b3aa-022fbcdb1ab5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157741,"FileName":"f8166dd7-d8ef-4b77-bd1b-57098991f08c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157741,"FileName":"216de4a6-84b8-4e84-a462-50d8569f9c96.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157741,"FileName":"de64d3e9-6210-44af-9c10-2d334aa9a58f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190624,"Name":"Wrecking Crew","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"A20","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190624,"FileName":"bdbf92c1-3c11-4dfe-b35e-d136d633c6d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190624,"FileName":"c451303f-04c0-4bee-8465-649fa228390f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190624,"FileName":"63e30a7c-a443-47f6-b03f-5587c5bd9900.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157742,"Name":"Wrestle Angels 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wrestle Angels 3 is, like its predecessors in the series, a turn-based wrestling-themed game.

The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\n\nXanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \"bumping\" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\n\nExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \"karma\" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many \"good\" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L4vJ1z6z4Q","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Yokoshiba Soft","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189954,"FileName":"a24e5528-8365-489a-8928-ea7dbb7a9c9a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189954,"FileName":"17aee734-2723-425b-9ff1-d01e88a9aafa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189954,"FileName":"77cc0bae-47c7-41df-b862-f7a2508817eb.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189954,"FileName":"63b3741d-46dd-4274-a4d6-e8fffc239b31.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189954,"FileName":"288259a2-1c37-430b-9462-974b0d915e10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189954,"FileName":"550e123b-4d4e-4b55-a30f-54e4f365de78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156972,"Name":"Xenon 2: Megablast","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature.

The player selects five team members for a mission; afterwards the girls are taken to a large battlefield.

There are no special attacks or any attack animations; however, the game will randomly display a sexual torture scene depicting a monster raping a girl during battles.\n\nBetween the battles, the player can sometimes choose to chat with the girls, which occasionally leads to a sex scene.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"D.O.

It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books.

It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys!\n\nYs: The Vanished Omens is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the \"attack\" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Dempa Shinbunsha","Publisher":"Dempa Shinbunsha","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"69661792-c9c5-48d1-bf5d-24b199885f4c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"2415d436-f989-41a8-ad48-c82885c497e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"79c25ae3-6150-409b-830a-230a9bec5db2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"dd7624ad-c195-416a-a914-06ce7a9af0f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"ff9ff87e-af9a-47ed-9661-52427552ea05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"be5b7d29-dd5f-435d-b76a-041c63a3ae09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189155,"FileName":"0bfe10a4-fe30-4ea9-9a89-91de992b3469.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189155,"AlternateName":"Ys 1","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189155,"AlternateName":"Ys 1 Ancient Ys Vanished Omen","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":192378,"Name":"Ys 2 Ancient Ys Vanished The Final Chapter (Milk House)","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Milk House","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":192378,"FileName":"5e084407-0490-41a2-8956-d456f3dbca4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192378,"FileName":"edb0b163-9da0-411f-b959-b84843d79c15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192378,"FileName":"9709275b-f689-4ee8-b4b9-91334c622e19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":192378,"AlternateName":"Ys 2 Ancient Ys Vanished The Final Chapter","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":192379,"Name":"Ys 2 Ancient Ys Vanished The Final Chapter (Missy.M)","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Missy.M's Homebrew version of the classic RPG.

The player should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise the hero will be killed. The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs.\n\nThe sequel offers a longer quest than the first installment, and adds a magic arsenal to Adol's abilities. Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies.

It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.\n\nSimilarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Popcom Soft","ReleaseDate":"1989-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":157753,"FileName":"7bca86d7-3ed6-4122-9eb2-10d05d7da068.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157753,"FileName":"469ce21f-1606-47bc-822e-562a5499d2d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":157753,"FileName":"04bc143b-0b9d-4c1e-8dff-781e2137ed9b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189162,"Name":"Zenkai Denshoku","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zenkai Denshoku is a Casino gambling game, developed by Office Koukan and published by Victor Interactive Software, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Office Koukan","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189162,"FileName":"e08eb814-5cc8-42ca-96af-024a7b7afc17.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189162,"FileName":"cdecff72-7d65-4612-8ce3-08553cd2a4c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189162,"FileName":"ac389b09-ed4e-41ed-9aff-28886e126a1a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192380,"Name":"Zero Master-Striker","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW2fnokfkuU","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Kazuyuki Shinjuki Gumi","Publisher":"Doujin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":192380,"FileName":"8435c9cd-ff4b-4746-a88c-824d4b249755.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192380,"FileName":"ca49f39f-16d2-47db-b5cb-7a645db894a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192380,"FileName":"b2da85f6-9e85-40a0-a719-0264323ca1cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192380,"FileName":"1f4df7be-43bd-48ec-92ef-ba801c4de609.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189211,"Name":"Zero Rei","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/KinLS2W79k0","Platform":"Sharp X68000","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Kazuyuki Shinjuki Gumi","Publisher":"Wako","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189211,"FileName":"baf69e8a-3b3f-4827-a76f-d463be831f59.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189211,"FileName":"9c6b0b01-d8d2-4eb9-a1f8-028ab42d8d2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189211,"FileName":"d8db4f2d-d2c2-4061-ba16-1192457112bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189211,"FileName":"2eed7e55-8a73-4e9c-ad31-dc6c536f44e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189163,"Name":"Zoku Dungeon Master: Chaos no Gyakushuu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Even in defeat, the Dark Lord planned a terrible revenge against the world.
