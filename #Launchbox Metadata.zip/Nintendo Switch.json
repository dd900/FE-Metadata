The protagonist is a Mexican slave who on the run, looking to make his way from Mexico to Texas while being chased by headhunters. After the tutorial the game is divided into four large acts where many different towns are visited along with encounters with characters that further the story. The game uses a hand drawn pen-and-paper art style and everything is coloured in shades of purple, except for the red trails and blotches of blood. The gameplay has many elements similar to Hotline Miami. Aside from using the same perspective, there is brutal violence and gun play that requires fast reflexes as a single shot is usually deadly. It is possible to go in all guns blazing, but it is more effective to draw out enemies one by one. There are also many sections in the game that require or encourage stealth, using a knife or a bow for instance. There is an unlimited amount of lives, but often there is trial-and-error involved to find an approach that works, so many areas will need to be played multiple times.\n\nThe Mexican carries a limited number of dynamite sticks that cause large explosions, along with a single melee and a single ranged weapon. Ranged weapons are revolvers, shotguns, rifles, but also stationary Gatling guns. Weapons have a limited amount of ammo and manual reloading is required. It is also not possible to keep shooting just until a clip is empty. There is a quick reloading mechanic that requires the player to release the mouse button used for aiming to load another bullet in the chamber, before it becomes possible to aim and shoot again. This heightens the tension in situations where multiple enemies need to be taken out in succession. Some weapons provide a wider range where it possible to slightly scroll the screen to look ahead. Additional ammo is picked up from dead bodies and it is also possible to swap weapons that way. Enemies also leave behind money used to buy perks such as homing rats carrying dynamite, a breastplate with a 50% chance for bullets to deflect, dual-wielding, twice the amount of ammo, and loading two bullets at once.\n\nThe game is largely linear, but there are some optional parts or scenes that can be approached in different ways or sometimes even be ignored. Especially after the first act the game opens up and for instance offers side missions. Often it is possible to search cabinets and other locations for items. Many parts of the environment can be used to seek cover or to hide. Enemies often hear shots or screams, they investigate bodies and their guard patrol path is shown through footsteps that disappear after a while. They do not react to the Mexican's footsteps, mainly the line of sight. Next to the main game there is an endless survival arena mode where players worldwide can compete for the best score, staying alive as long as possible and defeating waves of enemies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter; Stealth","Developer":"Ink Stains Games","Publisher":"HypeTrain Digital","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167896,"FileName":"164d2d07-4132-45ce-ba5b-375c428861a9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":167896,"FileName":"35b74968-c301-4b25-a76d-cc79a21a42ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167896,"FileName":"0fb85640-79ea-4956-90aa-1dec07e35433.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200206,"Name":"12 orbits","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"12 orbits doesn’t require any prior knowledge, preparation time or additional controllers.

In the first 60 seconds of a game, the player controls Ted, the head of the family, trying to make the best of the time given to collect supplies for the nuclear apocalypse and rescue the rest of the family.

Whatever and whoever ends up in the fallout shelter in that stage is what the player will have at their disposal in the second part of the game, when trying to survive in the fallout shelter.

Assisting him in his police work is Aiba, an advanced AI housed in his prosthetic eye. In addition to normal detective activities such as examining crime scenes and gathering testimonies, Date and Aiba are able to dive into a person's dream world, or Somnium, in order to uncover the truth a subject's conscious self can't or won't reveal.\n\nDate's newest investigation focuses on the death of a woman named Shoko Nadami, whose corpse was discovered with her left eye missing. As more bodies are discovered, each missing the left eye, it becomes apparent that they are the work of a serial killer dubbed the New Cyclops Killer. The more Date digs into the increasingly-complex case, the more it seems that it may have some connection to his missing memories and the Original Cyclops Serial Killings of six years ago...\n\nGameplay is divided into real world and Somnium segments. In the real world, Date examines crime scenes and talks to persons of interest in a point-and-click format. When normal human vision is insufficient, Aiba's special vision modes can be used to examine the environment. Violent confrontations play out as quick time events in which Aiba runs simulations to guide Date through the fight safely.\n\nIn Somnium, the player directly controls Aiba in a subject's dream. Although there is a strict time limit of six real-world minutes, the perception of time is different in a dream. Thus, instead of having to contend with a constantly ticking clock, each action the player performs will shave a different amount of time off of the 360-second total, and players are given limited opportunities to change the length of time an action will take. By interacting with objects and solving puzzles based on dream logic, Aiba can break a subject's mental locks and uncover the truth. Certain Somnia have multiple solutions, which will send the player down different story paths.

Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you’ll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don’t stand a chance in a direct assault;\n▪ Diverse, challenging opponents. From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early;\n▪ Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells.

Immerse yourself in a world so different from the one you know. The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nAlder's Blood is a dark, stealth, tactical game with the turn-based combat focused on avoiding enemy ambushes and setting up your own. Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god's decay.\n\nManage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind's survival.\n\nMonsters can detect a hunter's presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it.\n\nMonsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will.\n\nHunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used.\nAnd smaller ones, better for stealth actions.\n\nWithin their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest.\nIn addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp.\n\nRemember, this is not the world you know.\nThis is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology.\n\nYour resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Shockwork Games","Publisher":"No Gravity Games","ReleaseDate":"2020-03-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":200157,"FileName":"a8652d85-a2ca-4f30-9f68-06968a0317c8.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200157,"FileName":"83e114ba-f882-45ea-87c2-2ae7698aed34.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":200157,"FileName":"38201f16-a6b5-4a35-99eb-d24a8eaac399.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200157,"FileName":"30b12a76-49b0-4931-84d1-f0d234767bd4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200157,"FileName":"ddb6cfb2-75cb-4211-88d3-228eb334a23d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200157,"FileName":"83ca080e-a79b-42dd-b3ed-d60f6078d4f4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197202,"Name":"Aleste Collection","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Aleste Collection is a compilation of the 8-bit Sega games in Compile's Aleste series of 2D shooters.

Up to six players participate in quick game rounds in individual and team-based battles, with a goal to destroy opponents' ships or pilots, depending on the game mode. Players can compete against each other or team up against the AI. The game has multiple modes: Classic (4-player), Chaos (6-player), and Party (4-player, using any combination of touch screen or controllers). The game supports multiple controller types, including Joy-Con controllers (paired, horizontal, or vertical mode), Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and touch screen.\n\nShips are armed with offensive and defensive power-ups including missiles, lasers, jousters and shields. Areas are often dynamic with hiding places and hazards. The ships need to avoid turrets, death beams, and black holes. Many game modes can be mixed up with Ggame modifiers (enable asteroids, starting power-ups, super dashes etc.)\n\nCompared to the original game this version adds a Chaos mode for up to six players, a Party mode that supports touch-screen play, and gameplay mechanics balanced for mixing touch and controller play, and a Team Annihilation game mode that combines gameplay mechanics for the Pilot Hunters mode (run over pilots) with the Team Deathmatch mode. There are also two new pilots (Box Cat and Chomper) and a Sudden Death mechanic where killing beams ignite on both sides of the screen, and narrow down on remaining players. In the wacky Touch mode ships can only turn in one direction and in Ship Hunters players battle for the most kills.\n\nAlso new to this version are instant replays after completing a round, new music, stereo sound, localization for 12 languages, and several miscellaneous gameplay and polish additions.","MaxPlayers":"6","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/jaR6VpwZUAk","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Panic Button","Publisher":"Panic Button","ReleaseDate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193117,"FileName":"a0ba9b28-d349-433c-9357-b100f62ad131.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":193117,"FileName":"04999fc6-f4c4-43b6-b276-e5034ea6f35e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":193117,"FileName":"87ec4db9-1baa-4b3c-80b5-b2f674106d06.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193117,"FileName":"bd0a9e85-c807-471a-be81-da3f235f6a29.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193117,"FileName":"fe909b46-5bae-452f-86af-18ad6b40cc54.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193117,"FileName":"6aeab92a-9a4f-40b9-ba6d-aadf57ba20d4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":162781,"Name":"Atari Flashback Classics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The most comprehensive collection of arcade and home console classics comes to the Nintendo Switch™ system.

Movement resembles trick jumping or parkour through the quick succession of actions, air control, the ability to double jump, dash, sprint and hanging on for a high launch and so on. Each level is a short course based on \"the floor is lava\" principle; as soon as the ground is touched the level is lost. The main campaign consists of 90 levels grouped per ten for the different worlds: desert, forest, winter, laser, medieval, ancient, sci-fi, steampunk and hell. Each world introduces new elements such as multiple groups of trucks driving in different directions, gaps, moving structures, time limits, swinging hammers, flamethrowers, lasers, cannons shooting trucks and so on. Levels are unlocked gradually. While the main levels are always identical, because of the physics and player actions the gameplay is never completely the same.\n\nBased on speed and style, points are earned. These can be used to unlock movement and utility abilities. Only one of each can be equipped at all times. Movement abilities are air dash, disrespected blink (teleportation), double jump, grappling hook, jetpack, levitation, truck boost, and trucker flip. The utility abilities are back truck, epic mode, portable truck (a projectile that spawns a truck to land on), supertruck, time slow, and trucksolute zero (freezes all trucks). Each ability has a recharge time.\n\nThere is an in-game editor and integration with the Steam Workshop to create and share levels with other users. The best times can be compared on global leaderboards. There is Twitch streaming integration with audience participation where viewers can vote for events in real-time. Events include bouncy trucks, thin trucks, slower or faster speed, altered gravity and so on. The developers can influence the Twitch streams with their own commands if they are sent with the official Landfall Twitch account, influencing time and gravity, and changing colours.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform; Racing","Developer":"Landfall Games AB","Publisher":"tinyBuild LLC","ReleaseDate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"0e471342-9930-46fe-abea-9909755a0b5f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"2393c38f-f39a-4395-a48b-b25709df812b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"0021a4f6-54f5-4d02-8210-71d6941ecb2e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"cc4f8b77-510a-4cca-839e-b6f7d73091fb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"80fecae1-e70d-44a3-83b6-f85a3884824d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"a893641d-0f83-4943-ac62-6ba0732c1e56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162837,"FileName":"b38ba424-c71c-4246-81b4-4c9f19daa289.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194332,"Name":"Cobra Kai: The Karate Kid Saga Continues","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Choose a side, master your moves, and embrace your destiny in an epic beat 'em up adventure inspired by the hit show.

Your job is to roll into color-filled machines, which fill you with that color, and then touch buildings, walls, billboards, trees and Graydiants to restore their color. You can mix colors by rolling into two different primary colors (for example, blue and yellow gives you green). Some buildings are secured and cannot be colored simply by touching them - instead, de Blob jumps inside them and the player must shake the Wii Remote to fill them with color.\n\nEach area has gates that are sealed up - these can be opened by earning enough points. Points can be earned for all sorts of things - painting blocks of buildings, freeing Graydiants, completing challenges, and more. Once the player has earned enough points, they'll open up the exit to the level and can leave whenever they wish.\n\nThere are also hazards for de Blob - water will wash off your color, and you'll steadily lose your supply of paint if you remain in it. There are also ink pools and I.N.K.T. agents which stain you black if you let them.

In the game, players choose one of seven character classes – Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, Witch Doctor, or Wizard – and are tasked with defeating the Lord of Terror, Diablo.\n\nAn expansion pack, titled Reaper of Souls, was released for the PC versions of the game in March 2014, and was later released for consoles as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version in August 2014. The Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer pack was released for the Windows, macOS, and latest-generation console editions of the game in June 2017. Diablo III: Eternal Collection, combining Reaper of Souls and Rise of the Necromancer, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2017, and for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.\n\nDiablo III received critical acclaim, although its always-on DRM feature was criticized. The game set a new record for fastest-selling PC game by selling over 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release, and was the best selling PC game of 2012, selling over 12 million copies.

Dig for bones across four worlds of increasing difficulty. Battle enemies above perilous cliffs and sunken desert caves. Die a lot.\n\nFree Dig – An endless digging experience. Dig through an infinite set of levels with minor challenge and no game overs. Progress is saved.\n\n• Forge your own path as you creatively tunnel through each level.\n\n• Travel to new worlds!

Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you’ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you’ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.\n\nOr maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)\n\nAs you dig more, you may start to find some of the game’s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you’ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.\n\nOn a personal note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my hands.

As reported by the creators of the Game, Conton City is seven times larger than Toki-Toki City. Players are able to freely traverse this new hub world, and in some areas are even capable of flying around, however this feature will not be available from start, instead being unlocked. Players will also be able to travel to other hubs such as the Namekian Village and Frieza's ship. Some skills will have to be learned through masters, like the previous game. However, some masters will be found exclusively in these extra hubs. Xenoverse 2 is the fourth Dragon Ball video game to feature character customization. Players are able to choose from the five races of the first game: Humans, Saiyans, Majins, Namekians and Frieza's race. The game also features race-specific quests, minigames and transformations (the latter of which was only available to Saiyans in the first game, via the Super Saiyan forms). Players also have a much greater role in the story, as some decisions will have to be made by them. Multiplayer servers are now able to hold up to 300 players at once. The game also has a training mode called Training School. The player can use different kinds of ki blasts (Power, Homing, Rush, Paralyze and Bomb), and the ki blast type depends on the player's race or Super Soul. Another interesting element in the game is that players will be able to transfer their previous data from Dragon Ball XV 2's predecessor, Dragon Ball Xenoverse. This results in the game's details changing in a way that so players will be able to see the character known as the Toki Toki City's \"Hero\" in the middle of the square. Players also have the choice not to do this, which results as the default character being the \"Hero\".","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Fighting; Role-Playing","Developer":"Dimps","Publisher":"Bandai Namco","ReleaseDate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":141344,"FileName":"9a29bea2-8cd8-4bde-8088-0b97360c7e95.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168343,"Name":"Dragon Blaze for Nintendo Switch","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Psikyo is coming back!!

The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world to be one of four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.\n\nThe game was called an \"underdog darling of the indie game scene\"[1] during its high-profile and protracted five-year development cycle. Fez designer and Polytron founder Phil Fish gained celebrity status for his outspoken public persona[2][3] and his prominence in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, which detailed Fez '​s final stages of development and Polytron's related legal issues. Fez met critical acclaim upon its April 2012 release for Xbox Live Arcade. The game was ported to other platforms following the expiration of a yearlong exclusivity agreement.\n\nReviewers commended the game's emphasis on discovery and freedom, but criticized its technical issues, in-game navigation, and endgame backtracking. They likened the game's rotation mechanic to the 2D–3D shifts of Echochrome, Super Paper Mario, and Crush. Fez won awards including the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Eurogamer '​s 2012 Game of the Year. It had sold one million copies by the end of 2013, and it influenced games such as Monument Valley, Crossy Road, and Secrets of Rætikon. A planned sequel was canceled when Fish abruptly left the industry.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7NPzQg8noc","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Polytron Corp","Publisher":"Polytron Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2021-04-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":203979,"FileName":"e729fcf7-30bb-42fd-a6c5-f56a776d1a68.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":203979,"FileName":"33eb8744-5413-42ab-b450-9e1dc2ac3d64.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143671,"Name":"FIFA 18","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Are you ready for your biggest season yet?\n\n\nFIFA 18 on Nintendo Switch™ is the most immersive, social, and authentic football game ever created for Nintendo players.

The gameplay stays the same as the original with the player controlling little creatures that bounce around single screen levels with the aim of smashing gems. The gems are of various colours and therefore it's necessary to change the creature to the corresponding colour by hitting specific colour changing blocks. The player also has to avoid the skull blocks that kill the player upon contact. The most noticeable difference from the original is the new look with three dimensional graphics. Some minor differences in gameplay exist too. For instance there are no lives so the player can continue playing no matter how many skulls he touches.\n\nThe remake consists of the same story mode as the original game as well as a battle mode for two players but lacks the arcade mode from the Game Boy Advance version. New is a tutorial as well as extra special content that can be unlocked by progressing through the story mode.

It hit the Japanese arcade in 1994 and was followed by a Japanese release to the Saturn and the Playstation in the following year.\n\nThe game is set in a fantasy setting with steampunk elements. Lush forests and medieval castles meet steam trains and mech robots. Instead of piloting the genre-traditional space ships, Gunbird lets the player chose between five different characters (Ash, Marion, Valnus, Yuan Nang and Tetsu) who traverse the game world on broomstick, jet packs and pedal-powered helicopters on a quest to find the pieces of a magic mirror across seven stages.\n\nUnorthodox vehicles aside, the gameplay follows traditional genre standards. The main goal is to dodge all bullets that fill the screen while collecting power-ups to make the character stronger. Gunbird features one power-up that incrementally increases the firepower of the standard weapon (P-items) as well as additional ammo for the screen-clearing special ability (B-items). Standard weapon and special ability differ from character to character. Where some characters excel in high firepower in a straight line others allow for a wider spread of bullets or additional homing missiles.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Zerodiv","Publisher":"Zerodiv","ReleaseDate":"2017-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"400fe1ce-2e17-4a8d-91a9-d557ae049767.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"fed31b21-c252-4a83-b887-37fd10418e35.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"a9c71266-89d9-447b-9fb1-49bc6d67cc91.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"864d18a2-cef5-4e8e-8a75-52152801a610.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"6553b655-e122-4130-815f-1714cba86ee2.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"350926db-472c-402c-a09c-fcbb26f99c20.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"f51ff3e7-cef4-4db5-8330-1c991ba28d70.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"a28b7c25-a273-4b15-8e96-f618875d2a18.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"fafa5530-7e30-459b-aff6-ce6e718a9a73.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"26888fef-bd54-4554-b033-2a9afb7a80e5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193133,"FileName":"e637e7b1-eb8b-41f7-8430-bc9753c565b8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168493,"Name":"Gunlord X","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game features 11 stages of exciting 2D game play with over 60 unique enemy types.

Each run challenges the player through a random series of rooms populated with enemies and rewards, and the player uses a combination of their main weapon attack, dash power, and magic ability to defeat them. While Zagreus will often die, the player can use gained treasure to improve certain attributes or unlock new weapons and abilities to improve chances of escaping on subsequent runs.\n\nHades was developed following Supergiant's Pyre, a game in which they wanted to explore procedural narrative storytelling, but due to the nature of the main gameplay, found that players did not play through Pyre multiple times to explore this. The rogue-like structure of Hades gave them the opportunity to tell these branching stories to the player over the course of multiple runs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8x5xLHRho&t=19s","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Supergiant Games","Publisher":"Supergiant Games","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"ff71f9d3-fedf-4abe-806e-b43173321df2.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"e9a50ff6-8594-4653-a2a9-7bc6e176d914.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"0ecaa995-4133-461c-bf97-ab09ff4c34a9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"79effd42-3b16-4914-8fe6-23d3d5a8fa3c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"74c1600b-eb8c-4648-aa28-698cf419052a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"7cc9000d-7dda-42bd-b74c-ffcd028c51f1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"ba23b8d0-4b3e-4fab-8ddb-701fa5fd4f10.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190288,"FileName":"fdf2ddca-5306-437b-9701-0eedfe790717.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168494,"Name":"Hammerwatch","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The highly acclaimed hack and slash action adventure Hammerwatch is finally here on Nintendo Switch!\n\nBe prepared to kill hordes of enemies with varied looks and features through unique environments with traps, hidden secrets and lots of puzzles.\n\nMaster each of 7 different classes, including The Sorcerer, a new class coming first to consoles.

By combining old school design with a contemporary influence, Homo Machina delights with its clever dialogue between the absent-minded director at the helm of the body-machine and Josiane, his diligent secretary, encouraging players to put to task the armada of workers to get the incredible factory up and running.\nAfter Californium, Homo Machina is the new video game created by Darjeeling production.

The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.\n\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.

Players press buttons with the right timing to get an Excellent, Good, or Miss, depending on the timing. A Miss affects the player's health, which causes the game to end when it has run out. Players work to level up the characters' health and attack power, with each character having two types of ranged and melee attack abilities.\n\nThe main single player mode is World Tour, which is the \"story campaign\" of the game. Each song is categorized into a stage, either Field Battle (world exploration tracks), where players complete songs rhythmically in each world, and face appropriate enemies in each stage from the original games in which the song is based on, Memory Dive (tracks associated with a specific character or uses vocals), where players replay stages from past games in music video-like sequences with gameplay similar to Field Battles, and Boss Battle (tracks associated with bosses), where players face bosses from the series. After songs have been completed, they can be replayed individually. Melody of Memory features three-person parties, of which there are four different groupings. Once new parties have been unlocked, they can be used at any time. Disney characters serve as guest members in their specific themed worlds, bringing different sounds and symbols to the gameplay. King Mickey serves as a fourth party member, assisting the player with healing and additional rhythm points when activating the \"Summoning Star\" item.Traversal between each of the worlds is done through the Gummi Ship, a system used in previous mainline Kingdom Hearts games. Melody of Memory features the series' Beginner, Standard, and Proud difficulties, while each stage has three play options available: Basic; One Button, which removes button complexity and allows party members to auto-attack; and Performer, which adds additional enemies and button sequences. Each stage features various objectives to complete, that award material to unlock new songs and items. Clearing stages unlocks a music and cinematic scene player.\n\nMultiplayer modes include Double Play co-op mode, where players compete locally together playing as Sora and Riku to get the highest collective score, COM versus, where players compete against the computer to get a high rank three times out of five, and versus mode, where players compete against each other online or with local multiplayer (Nintendo Switch only) for the best score in a best 2 out of 3. This mode features \"tricks\", which are used to disrupt the other player, once at the beginning of the track and again towards the end. There are 10 different types of tricks, with co-director Masanobu Suzui saying they make completing the songs \"more tricky and complicated\" given how players can combine the tricks. Winning in versus mode increases a player's ranking and awards two collectible cards, while the runner-up receives one. The Nintendo Switch version of the game features a free-for-all battle royal mode, where up to eight players can compete against each other in local multiplayer. The gameplay of Melody of Memory has been compared to Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Music","Developer":"Square Enix","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197229,"FileName":"bb99f7c9-b39a-418f-b6fc-a0f6d6d9399f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":197229,"FileName":"6c104368-eb2f-41af-8322-c95bfd50e6ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197229,"FileName":"aa7e49d3-af00-4935-b715-8a7efd5a6da0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197229,"FileName":"2d69ecb6-eb9d-44ae-a05d-8c374d1cea3a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197229,"FileName":"ab9c3d4f-5cfd-4ba9-866c-b53013a6d81c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197229,"FileName":"33b45a03-35f0-436f-adc8-fda2cbd05e84.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185465,"Name":"Kingdom Rush","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Get ready for an epic journey to defend your kingdom against hordes of orcs, trolls, evil wizards and other nasty fiends using a vast arsenal of towers and spells at your command!\n\nFight on forests, mountains, and wastelands, customizing your defensive strategy with different tower upgrades and specializations!

Apart from the typical gold bricks puzzles, quests and challenges, the game adds a new feature called the Crime Wave, where the player travels to a specific area of one of the cities which is under assault from super-villains and their minions. The player must complete all the quests given by the people in the area to complete the Crime Wave. Usually, the final quest is about defeating the super-villain. There are 10 Crime Waves in total and 5 super-villains to defeat. 3 are taken from the movies: Bomb Voyage, Underminer and Syndrome, while 2 are new original characters: Brainfreezer and Anchor-Man. \n\nThe game also has a complex character customiser similar to the one from Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.

The player controls a protagonist simply known as the The Boy, who is said to enter the world Limbo in search of his sister. However, the story as a whole can also be seen as a metaphor for the search for companionship and getting around in a new environment. Not a single clue is given at the start, there are no cut-scenes and the game starts right away. In that world filled with hazards and danger, his means are few and he is extremely vulnerable. Only two buttons are used, a feeble jump and one to perform an action, combined with movement. This allows him to explore the world and hang on ledges, slide down slopes, push objects, pull levers, and cling to ropes, but the player has to make most of what is present in the environment to get by, often with physics-based elements.\n\nThe gloomy world has a dusty filter showing the game through misted glass, and no vivid colours are present. It is divided into 24 chapters that seamlessly flow into each other, only from the level selection in the main menu can be derived where a new chapter starts. The world is rendered in 2D but with different layers of depth in the scenery. It moves from a forest to an abandoned city and eventually an industrial zone. The player faces three kinds of challenges. There are obstacles where The Boy simply needs to find a way to progress, there are dangerous creatures that hunt him down and try to kill them, and finally there is a gang of children who band together to ward off the intruder and set up traps for him, with a touch of Lord of the Flies. Encounters with other humans are however brief and rare. These account for most of the horror moments, of the psychological kind, with other unnerving sequences like when the player is forced to use the corpses of other children as a bridge.\n\nMusic and sound effects are minimal and there are no on-screen elements referring to health or other statistics. Every single misstep, often with gruesome consequences, is fatal. In the same vein the boy cannot jump from great heights or jump very far. When dead, the game immediately reloads before the current puzzle. Most of the encounters are centered around puzzles and these are sometimes based on timing or speed when being chased. Other elements serve only for setting the scene, when The Boy gets to ride a boat to cross a lake (he cannot swim and drowns immediately) or finds the corpses of the people who did not make it in Limbo. Most of the game elements are discovered through experimentation, like the effects of a glowing worm that attaches itself to The Boy's head, changing the flow of gravity, or what happens when a giant spider captures him. There is only a single path through the levels and generally there is only a single solution to a problem.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Playdead","Publisher":"Playdead","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"eb82dd99-f577-4c3d-85ec-c5ccf2266caf.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"172fb281-2df1-4125-8fdf-d0efa5e1da39.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"a8c73cda-cc2a-4756-b42c-887f3319d5c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"c1a46070-c176-4952-a11c-ac398fe4fca9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"9ddc9e4e-920d-48cd-9119-fe3617e2b272.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"026cdbd7-8e1b-4391-8bd7-a6f15d349c80.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"5a7b345e-e483-4efc-b015-9ae0edee8c66.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"dc3df99a-c9b6-429f-837d-7508c19ff9ca.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163006,"FileName":"107c302f-ba76-4aab-b5fc-0b0eaae350e5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168525,"Name":"Little Dragons Café","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Little Dragons Café opens with a twin brother and\nsister learning to cook and manage a small café\nwith their mother.

You run, you jump, and you lay down your own checkpoints. The player is assigned 100 lives and is tasked with steering a white 5x8 stick figure through sixteen levels of increasingly difficult jumping puzzles, often broadly inspired by classic 8- and 16-bit games. Avoid spikes, navigate platforms, and try hard not to fall.\n\nThe key feature is in the checkpoints. The player needs to not only master the jumping physics but to exercise good judgment in placing checkpoints -- as at the risk of replaying a large part of the level, the player must weigh the value of personal time and frustration versus the commodity of the character's remaining lives.\n\nThe visuals are extremely simple and low-resolution, running on a resizable 160x120 pixel display. Backgrounds generally consist of black and one other color -- black serving as navigable space, and the other color serving as solid surfaces -- with all sprites white against that background.

Together with old pals and new comrades alike, Jesse embarks on a brand new journey filled with tough choices, good times, and at least one temperamental llama.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168888,"FileName":"9ad346e8-5ee3-4e6a-a742-56b3bc94fcf3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168888,"FileName":"67e2480a-8b30-45b7-b773-462dea5e899f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143676,"Name":"Minecraft: Story Mode: The Complete Adventure","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Embark on a perilous quest across the Overworld, to the End, and beyond.\n\n\nWith a team of friends at your side, and a troubled land in need of heroes, your decisions – what you say and do – drive the story around you, so choose wisely!\n\nFeatures fan favorites Stampycat, DanTDM, CaptainSparklez, StacyPlays and LDShadowLady.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with Mojang, the creators of Minecraft.\n\nIncludes all five episodes of Season One and all three episodes of the Adventure Pass.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Telltale Games","Publisher":"Telltale Games","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143676,"FileName":"0a801daa-4453-4129-b2df-45d513cf5b11.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143676,"FileName":"c1e44a52-d697-4bb2-aacc-e957daacffcd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143676,"FileName":"c0f6322f-f2e9-405c-a9fd-358d51ef5561.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168538,"Name":"Minesweeper Genius","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Inspired by the classic computer game from our childhood - as well as sudoku and picross - Minesweeper Genius is a brain teaser that will challenge your mind and logical thinking.\n\nHelp Aristotle – the genius with a broom – sweep the minefield to regain his memory and escape from the aliens' scientific experiments, discovering where all the bombs are hidden.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n\n• Read the numbers to calculate how many mines there are in each column and each line\n• Flag the tiles which contain a mine\n• Then move the minesweeper genius to the portal!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Our procedural generator can create an unlimited number of random levels\n• Mixes the mechanics of sudoku, nonogram (picross) and minesweeper\n• Absolutely no guessing or luck involved","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Blowfish Studios","Publisher":"Blowfish Studios","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168538,"FileName":"f98602f7-7502-4642-a9c1-fcbb9db7f4a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163039,"Name":"Mini Metro","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for a rapidly expanding city.

To cross it and reach your family, you must compete on - and win - a reality TV show broadcast by the Regime.\n\nMinistry of Broadcast is a narrative-driven single player cinematic platformer mixing Orwell’s 1984 with modern reality TV. Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system.\n\nSeemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on “The Wall Show”, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems.\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them.\n\n* Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game’s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs.\n\n* Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas. You’ll have to interact with the environment itself to solve most of the puzzles: use the protagonist’s momentum to move platforms, flip the occasional lever, and sometimes you might have to sacrifice an NPC or two to cross a particularly spiky pit.\n\n* Story and Personality: Featuring lots of impish humor, Grade A sarcasm, and comic mischief, all balanced perfectly with the dark, heavy themes presented in this dystopian world.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Ministry Of Broadcast Studios","Publisher":"Hitcents","ReleaseDate":"2020-04-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185474,"FileName":"f02e871d-41eb-4f17-b862-9bc9940fd5cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185474,"FileName":"03cf0292-73ff-4948-9353-b162b34d2f0f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163040,"Name":"Minit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Minit is a peculiar little adventure played sixty seconds at a time.

Release the button, and a flurry of missiles will destroy all targeted foes, Macross-style.\n\nYour standard shot, meanwhile, is a bit weedy and is best used to deal with incoming enemy missiles, which cannot be targeted by your own. Blowing up enemies releases gems which can be collected to boost your score further, and you're rewarded for chaining together missile barrages.\n\nSet across eight levels – each with its own epic boss battle at the end – Missile Dancer is a purebred, old-school shooter. The levels and sprites designs look like they've been lifted straight from an early '90s arcade shooter, while the music and sound effects are similarly nostalgic – not to mention effective.\n\nScoring points is the aim of the game, as getting to the end of those eight levels won't take you very long (on the 'Normal' difficulty, at least – the higher levels are much more challenging), and the developer has included a 'Caravan' mode which tasks you with scoring as many points as possible in a three-minute time limit. Because the next wave of enemies is only released in this mode when you've finished those already on-screen, there's a lot of room for clever and tactical play, which massively expands the longevity of the game. It's a shame, then, that the leaderboard included is local only, and not online.\n\nMissile Dancer can be played co-operatively with a second person on Switch, and has an English language option which delivers some amazing 'Engrish' text – another faithful throwback to the '90s arcade scene, you could argue. There's also a TATE mode, but at the time of writing it only turns the screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which means you can't fully insert your Switch into the Flip Grip accessory (the screen needs to be turned 90 degrees clockwise for that). It's no biggie, though, and we'd imagine the developer will fix this in a future update.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjBx5XfCrvk","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"TERARIN GAMES","Publisher":"TERARIN GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2020-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"fba1d7ab-6e97-40af-a5a2-1dcfc305caaf.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"1a0e8d7b-f54d-467b-8fd3-653fdd70e0a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"cbded1c0-b1c1-4226-bb0d-df11afd6ec18.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"c65595f2-9816-462c-8d91-3f576197e7f7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"227f1e6f-36f3-47ab-888d-1cfbe9f87b2a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"a046f405-f657-418e-a933-b81587db802b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":194411,"FileName":"38403fa7-5cf0-468e-8e29-edab176e9959.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193294,"Name":"Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"High-speed swordplay battle action!!\nHigh school girls + Japanese swords!

The perpetrator, Dragon, will wreak millions of calamitous years upon the people of Love-De-Gard with her power. Yet, the people have produced a hero who must travel to Dragon Castle and destroy the beast. After playing through a few typical RPG scenes (random battles, an airship sequence, etc.), the boy is ordered by his mother to go to bed and obediently does so. However, the television on which he was just playing Fake Moon switches back on by itself, and the boy is sucked into the world of Moon, a land called \"Love-de-Gard.\" Its people and its story resembles Fake Moon's.\n\nThe player must explore a vast world named Love-De-Gard. A dragon has swallowed the moonlight, with calamitous consequences. Castle Love-De-Gard houses the King's room, the Minister's room, the throne room, hallways, the balcony, the soldiers’ room, and the King's toy room. In Castle Town, Boy finds Fountain Square, a floristry, a general store, a bakery, a bar, and Yoshida's home. At Rainbow Rocks, there is Granny's house, Tao's hiding place, the rainbow machine, and Boy's house (which was formerly Nikka's and Pokka's house). In Tropical Field, one discovers Whaleshell Cove, Ossan's Cave, Tamaya's, American House, Windmill Hermitage, and Eco-Club Headquarters. One sees, in the Valley of the Wind, Twilight Canyon, Splitting Sunbeam Road, and Wildcat House. There is Mushroom Forest, which contains Burrn Hall, Adder's House, Mushroom Forest itself, and a haunted house. Within Technopolis, Boy sees Doctor Steinhager's office, Technopolis proper, Club Techno, and the V.I.P. Room.

However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres. With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKyeGZ-yoow","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165038,"FileName":"7a53a8c8-47e3-4697-8aee-e8b3994f9bff.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165038,"FileName":"382a0aa9-7884-469b-b57a-972be94579f4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165038,"FileName":"3be2ad6d-b67a-4668-9d32-b3c0ee8add8b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165038,"FileName":"0b2a784a-0ce6-4f63-bd65-bc186013bee2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168552,"Name":"Oninaki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The all-new Action-RPG, ONINAKI tells the story of one Watcher on a journey to protect Life, after Death.

With five giant streamers under his control, King Olly binds Princess Peach’s Castle and transports it to a distant mountain as part of his plan to re-fold the world.\n\nOn his journey to liberate Peach’s Castle and repair the ravaged paper landscape, Mario meets Olivia, King Olly’s sister, and the two join forces to put a stop to Olly’s origami onslaught. Even Bowser falls victim to Olly’s plot when his minions are turned into origami Folded Soldiers and betray their Koopa king, forcing him to ally with Mario and Olivia!\n\nBattle the Folded Soldiers in ring-based battles that challenge you to strategically line up enemies to maximize damage! Out of battle, Mario can use the arm-extending 1,000-Fold Arms ability in specific spots to interact with the landscape to pull, peel, hit, and more! Join Mario, Olivia, and their companions on a journey of laughter and emotion, thrills, and a whole lot of folding.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX6DTLcWUdY","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Intelligent Systems","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"4f0afc8f-71fa-44c4-995c-6a9bb6c1c9b8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"4ed320ac-efe9-4d39-b48b-a04ad9ff3af6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"90cebe15-954e-44f6-94b9-7eca5560e4f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"356725d7-58db-460f-8cb7-2aaef9863600.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"95de03a4-a738-49d8-ae4c-491c7977939c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"5a56caaa-8fd0-40e5-9bac-cc2fe58e8542.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"c6bd6b5e-d460-4cf0-affc-da4f2de164a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"7b19a134-23b3-4cc0-874f-c6eb029d6d55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"6c46ba84-247e-40f9-901e-693740458381.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"8075e837-d204-44a8-861c-478538668b87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"c3ade754-0732-4a28-97b9-d15c08e20791.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"a4246d31-506d-4e3f-b065-3d812d09b59e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"172b36ce-2f14-4f32-a05c-e1d5f865e472.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"2abdb729-4581-4063-935b-34ca3e898f66.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"61639ffc-5383-4d13-b707-d60a3467ba6c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"17b92059-e4a6-4e78-88c8-720d5798cda6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"3161e017-d47f-4d2d-8032-28035c375e0c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"dd0ce6f5-48fe-459f-b1a5-ecf9a839f280.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":180599,"FileName":"7451b5ff-edf9-4255-bc28-3ba32ab8907f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177833,"Name":"Paranautical Activity","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Old-school FPS action with a roguelite twist\n\nParanautical Activity ​is a blisteringly-fast first-person shooter that combines classic​ arena-style FPS action​ with​ ​roguelite elements.

A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind Games.\nPsychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.\n\n\nThe story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary’s true intentions, the dread begins.\n\n\n \nKEY FEATURES\nRemothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.\n\n\n- Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action, strategic, hide ‘n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and his path. Don’t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.\n\n\n- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.\n\n\n- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.\n \nAudio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.\n- No health bars - Your body is the only way to understand how you are doing.\n\n\n- Realistic puzzles - Environments and characters have been conceived to be realistic and credible.\n\n\n- Top-notch soundtrack - Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni wrote the music for the game.\n\n\n- Real-time loading - Explore the mansion without worrying about empty moments or boring loading times.\n\n\n \nIn addition, the Nintendo Switch™ version of the game presents these extra features:\n- A free integrated Artbook that players will unlock the first time they finish the game. This Artbook will contain the characters, locations and storyboard sequences’ concept art, collected items during the game, wireframes and 3D models of the mansion and characters.\n\n\n- Controller’s vibration.\n\n\n- Spatialized audio.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Stormind Games","Publisher":"Darril Arts","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"6af6e25e-3913-4075-9457-8589110dd61b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"a1d93bfb-b46d-4fa1-9e9c-83813e0aa747.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"bda6dfe1-8269-45c3-86c1-d81a03fcf5ee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"bd6b9cff-34ce-4629-84fc-b9957c0d2061.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"4cdb4f08-9a0e-4ff1-bc10-ca328011bf54.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"542b67a7-cce6-4b60-ab55-aa02afdd1e86.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168726,"FileName":"0660cff3-cadc-4776-aab6-7094a5ea5ffb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167972,"Name":"Resident Evil","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Relive the nightmare.\n\nHailed by many as a masterpiece, this remake of the first entry in the long-running Resident Evil series is now playable in HD.

Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also utilize boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.\n\nMatches are typically five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well as casual and ranked.

Should some dungeon adventuring be on the day’s itinerary, you can craft or buy a vast array of swords, spears, and staves along with magic for battle against dangerous foes, or even bring along some companions or friendly monsters to aid you during your travels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b21S3XfaN4I","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Life Simulation; Role-Playing","Developer":"Hakama","Publisher":"Xseed Games","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"c8f3978a-e837-4569-8163-8a3524d02e8d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"1b03f0e0-2763-4581-98f0-ae0835f3c36e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"2cae1b41-abd1-4b3c-813b-a55e76c8eb3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"98a8f488-3007-41c5-a352-b27a3dbc4035.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"6a1cf5b1-f5a2-431b-8db2-5652825c49a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"b61552a4-c045-4d5d-8b3e-7dfcfd4573bb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"2c8447f2-a22c-4701-bd17-43dc2453df5b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"20158597-5467-4a4b-9686-aae091a926e4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164268,"FileName":"87475336-6229-4a6d-85d1-dd8ca1eefc37.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151082,"Name":"Runner3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"CommanderVideo is back! \n\nThe rhythm-music gameplay of BIT.TRIP RUNNER and Runner2 is back and better than ever! \n\nThe Timbletot is determined to rid the multiverse of all its love and happiness.

Originally developed by Media.Vision, it is an entry in Sega's Shining series of video games, and an expanded and remastered version of the Japan-only Shining Resonance released for the PlayStation 3 in 2014. While the original PS3 release was not translated into English, Refrain was released in July 2018 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One platforms.\n\nThe game follows Yuma Ilvern, who holds the Spirit of the Shining Dragon, an ancient Dragon who died in an ancient war. At the start of the game, Yuma is held captive in Gaelritz Prison with an attempted rescue mission by Sonia Blanche and Kirika Towe Alma on the way. After a confrontation with Excella Noa Aura and her three spears, Yuma summons the Blade of the Shining Dragon, the Vanderhorn. They then manage to escape on the back of the Shining Dragon after Yuma transformed into him and return to Marga, the capital of Astoria. When he wakes up back as Yuma, he joins Astoria in their war against the Empire alongside the Dragoneers and the Princess of Astoria in an attempt to achieve peace for their people.\n\nThe game plays as a traditional J-RPG with action-based battles. Interactions between the main character and others affect their \"relationship level\"; talking while resting or camping initiates special story scenes, which in turn can lead to dating scenes the following day.\n\nIt received mixed reception upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic, but saw more popularity in Japan.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Media.Vision","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2018-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"1155bb4b-9974-454e-8ad2-607693b43e2e.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"f08e4a0a-addf-4e11-93ce-541e40613304.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"8c1a3c5f-418d-44d9-9136-6c79789dfe50.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"d5efa7dd-4895-422f-9533-643baa1d25af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"32d5dbc5-0b92-49ec-be19-202d5e8c9dee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"560a6df8-efd8-4535-be8d-eb82a9f63b8c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"5283ba6d-1644-4a3e-90a9-608ade0c227d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"1cc4b71e-5880-4722-96bc-b1c82397cba3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"e6d01a5c-83a7-47a0-b866-117b8d2af1bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"22f6cbcd-a801-48d7-bb7c-f3b7f64c8d9b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168755,"FileName":"d9ac7cb6-895a-4e25-b619-85b0d59c99de.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200619,"Name":"Shinsekai Into the Depths","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wondrous Discovery\nCapcom presents a fresh and original undersea exploration game, filled with unique visual and audio experiences for you to discover.\n\nThe land has slowly but steadily been covered with ice, forcing mankind to take refuge in the ocean.

After a decade of war with the Lunar invaders we named the Selenites, the British Empire finally vanquished the insect-like menace thanks to a dashing officer by the name of Hugo Wells. He crushed the colony’s queen and in doing so cemented his status as both a hero of the empire, and the de facto patriarch of the drone-like Selenites.\n\nFollowing the war, the Selenites became the new workforce of our industrial revolution, ushering in a new era of progress and prosperity. Freed from the shackles of employment, man could pursue more earthly endeavors. However, listlessness and disobedience rampaged throughout the middle and working classes.

The gameplay is unique – Vincent is unarmed, so he must choose his moves wisely. He can only throw small electro-bombs which lure the robots and halt their progress for a while. Vincent has to walk through the streets in such a way that the robot chasing him hits upon a Tesla coil and is destroyed. It seems quite easy in the first levels. Then you have to fight several robots at the same time, the robots become faster and faster, some of them can fly and other respond to Vincent’s every move.\n\nNarrative elements are of great importance. In 2016 Steamburg won an award for Best Storytelling at White Nights in Helsinki. Dialogues reveal Vincent to be a scientist responsible for testing a new weapon in Steamburg. At the same time he is searching for his fiancée who was reported to be in Steamburg when the robots attacked. Some narrative elements are connected directly with the gameplay.

Controlling one of 15 characters from the series' cast, players compete in races using sports cars.

Team Sonic Racing differs from traditional kart racers because of its focus on cooperative gameplay, similar to the kind featured in Splatoon (2015) and Overwatch (2016)—players are part of a team of racers and win races through efficiency rather than speed. Game modes include earning competing to earn points, time trials, customizing the racing rules, and a story-driven tutorial campaign.","MaxPlayers":"12","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXKZJnND8fY","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sumo Digital","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2019-05-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"2d4c9673-ee3e-416b-ac19-feef30ff4826.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"fb001166-2e40-4005-97df-9618dcc373c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"0e2bb0f4-6105-469c-9eee-28a9b84ea52b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"708b3dfc-bd17-4cb5-af9d-8c66307af820.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"0c676e00-2366-49f5-853a-efa02f6d5f2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"5f82aa41-dd2c-42e6-9746-de3725e8497b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"3cf119be-51df-4349-8fe5-339c16033fcc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"cedf2889-46c9-4eaa-8fc8-b7b6723def5b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"5d9920d1-4409-4170-98c2-979323659e31.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"80f90a1b-a442-440b-bc6b-3ac9d4877a8a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"d3f848c3-6ee5-4923-af8b-6929d636263b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"01540f3e-b4e2-4d54-8b1f-da6a0bf7bb8c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"b21ae2fc-3498-4727-a48b-b0d0fd250ade.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"e304bdbb-5607-479e-93d9-b63aa192aafb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"0dc34daa-80b4-43da-b65e-8766f1fa19a6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"6522d14c-5097-47dd-9873-d25af37ca91c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"2109a575-98b1-4053-ae28-c37455de765b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165981,"FileName":"8cb07e0e-31d6-4458-a95e-f12b640b6ed5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":204021,"Name":"Telling L!es","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An investigative thriller game with non-linear storytelling, Telling Lies revolves around a cache of secretly recorded video conversations.

As with the traditional Tetris formula, players rotate and drop shaped bricks known as tetrominoes onto a board. Players can clear tetrominoes by completing rows across both sides, whereas players will lose if tetrominoes overflow off the top of the board. As with normal Tetris rules, players have the option to store a tetromino piece to swap out at any time. By clearing multiple lines or performing continuous line clears in a row, players can send \"garbage\" to other players, which will appear on their board unless they can quickly clear lines in response. More garbage can be sent by completing combination moves in succession of making a \"tetris\" (matching 4 lines at once) or performing a \"T-spin\" (squeezing the T-shaped tetromino into a position it would otherwise not fall into by rapidly rotating it).\n\nDuring gameplay, small grids representing the other 98 players are displayed at the sides of the main board. Players can either choose to target individual players, or have the computer automatically target other players based on one of four criteria: random players, those who are targeting the player, those who are close to being defeated, and those who possess badges. Badges are earned by knocking out a player with garbage (or gray lines), which earns them a piece of a badge, along with any other badges or pieces that player had. The more badges a player completes and possesses, the more lines they can send to other players at a time (up to a 100% boost). At the end of a game, players will earn experience that will increase their level. The game periodically features special events; one of its first such events was held in March 2019 where players with the top number of wins over a weekend play period would win rewards within the My Nintendo loyalty program.\n\nIn May 2019, Nintendo released paid downloadable content (DLC) for the game, named the Big Block DLC. The DLC adds 2 offline modes: CPU Battle, where players battle 98 bot players; and Marathon, where players play an endless game of Tetris, and challenged to achieve the highest score. Nintendo plans to release more modes in the future. Additionally modes will include a local offline mode, allowing multiple players to compete locally.","MaxPlayers":"99","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkltybqKrnc","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Arika Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2019-02-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":169081,"FileName":"0c1e493e-b823-4769-ab56-ebc2a0027c7b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":169081,"FileName":"66f9a8af-fab8-4648-8ecb-9c21ad55a9f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":169081,"FileName":"d24ad245-a192-4899-88fc-705f508f9b8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":169081,"FileName":"2ec85260-050f-4e34-92ae-831d6a01a871.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":169081,"FileName":"e20c2da1-0c6f-4c16-96d0-e1f96fa367e0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168310,"Name":"The Adventure Pals","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A story of love, giraffes, and hot dogs.\n\nInspired by classic platformers and cartoons alike, The Adventure Pals sets you and your best friends (a giraffe and a rock) out to save the world and your dad from turning into hotdogs!

Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence.\n\nWelcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.\nFeatures:\n\n    Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!\n    Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way.\n    Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"Weappy Studio","Publisher":"THQ Nordic","ReleaseDate":"2018-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":168851,"FileName":"d91b4ccc-fefa-45dc-9250-f19a22dce3d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168851,"FileName":"f3fbdf0b-e0b0-44a0-a177-4babca0c2a8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168851,"FileName":"095973eb-f2fc-481c-baee-bf00a8d9886d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168851,"AlternateName":"This is the Police 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163130,"Name":"This War of Mine: Complete Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers.

It was originally released for Microsoft Windows in November 2011, with ports later being released for Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch. The story follows two doctors who offer to fulfill a dying man's last wish using artificial memories. The game features relatively few gameplay mechanics, with the player controlling the two doctors, exploring the narrative and solving puzzles as they try to reconstruct the dying man's memories in order to fulfill his wish.\n\nThe game was designed by Kan Gao using the RPG Maker XP toolkit. Development started in 2010, when Gao was struck by questions of mortality following his grandfather's life-threatening condition. To the Moon would become Freebird Games' first commercial product, following smaller, experimental games released for free on the studio website. The game was updated later to include free downloadable content, called \"minisodes\", to give more context to the main characters. In 2014, Freebird Games released A Bird Story, a short \"minisode\" that connects To the Moon with its sequel, Finding Paradise.\n\nWhile criticized for its lacking gameplay, To the Moon received praise for its narrative and music, thematic material and emotional power. The game was nominated for several awards by gaming outlets, earning \"Best Story\" from GameSpot's 2011 end-of-year awards. Retrospectively, To the Moon is highly regarded by critics and players alike for its story, with some considering it as an example of artistic expression in video games. An animated film adaptation is in development, and will be partially scripted and supervised by Gao.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGEovo2mdIc","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Freebird Games","Publisher":"X.D.

Under the care of a kindly monster woman named Toriel, they learn the basics of the underground world, including that they may be attacked by other monsters who are less friendly. After the child leave's Toriel's care, it's up to them how they proceed through the underground, including whether they kill the monsters in their way or try to find peaceful resolutions to conflict.\n\nUndertale is an Eastern RPG with some action aspects in its combat system. In the overworld, the player explores areas, solves puzzles, and talks to NPCs. When a battle is triggered, typically through random encounter, the game switches to the combat screen. A heart representing the child's soul appears in a small box, in which objects representing the monsters' attacks appear and must be dodged in real time. On the child's turn, they can attack monsters more directly through the fight command. A meter that determines the strength of the player's attack must be hit with good timing in order to deal more damage.\n\nAlternatively, players may choose to perform friendly actions in battle or show mercy to the opponent in order to resolve conflict without bloodshed. It is possible to finish every encounter in the game without killing anyone, though some monsters are more difficult to do this with than others. The player may need to perform certain actions in the overworld before some monsters can be befriended.\n\nAlthough only one Undertale save file can be kept at a time, the game remembers certain player actions across playthroughs, mainly in reference to how violent or peaceful they were. Resetting to an earlier save or starting a new game after specific actions are taken can affect how some NPCs treat the player and how the story is ultimately resolved.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"8-4, Ltd","Publisher":"8-4","ReleaseDate":"2018-09-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163021,"FileName":"7a3e0099-0374-4179-8b32-98076110bbd2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163021,"FileName":"81bb5ebc-e71a-48e2-9d75-d891498db6ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163021,"FileName":"61fb7ece-822f-42c6-a794-e6b5f0847b10.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168857,"Name":"Unepic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Daniel was just an average guy.

It was released on 27 October 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and was released on 29 June 2018 for Nintendo Switch. The eighth main entry in the Wolfenstein series and the sequel to 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order, the game is set in an alternate history which takes place in 1961 following the Nazi victory in the Second World War. The story follows war veteran William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and his efforts to fight against the Nazi regime in America. \n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and most of its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress. A binary choice in the prologue alters the game's entire storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced throughout the timelines. The game features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present. Continuing from The New Order, the development team aimed to characterize Blazkowicz for players to adopt his personality. \n\nWolfenstein II: The New Colossus was released to a positive critical response. Particular praise was directed at the characters, narrative, shooting mechanics, as well as the general presentation of the game. The game was nominated for multiple year-end awards, including nominations at the 35th Annual Golden Joystick Awards[1] and The Game Awards 2017, the latter in which it received the accolade for \"Best Action Game\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq72sNQrsHE","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Machinegames","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164481,"FileName":"0799e7f8-4aa6-4af9-b097-82f1a5adc6df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164481,"FileName":"ab7dfcf9-2da7-429e-8e2b-16704144b43a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164481,"FileName":"2a693ba7-f74d-4de1-93d9-182da273bedd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164481,"FileName":"3f9b0637-861c-4d06-83b0-43fc403e173b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164481,"FileName":"6d168d43-dabd-4f29-8a67-dffa6b1e0ddc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":204028,"Name":"Wolfenstein: Youngblood","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wolfenstein: Youngblood is the first modern co-op Wolfenstein adventure.\n\nNineteen years after the events of Wolfenstein II, BJ Blazkowicz has disappeared after a mission into Nazi-occupied Paris.

The 2019 Nintendo Switch port included these new features as well.\n\nTakuya Arima is a young student whose father, a famous historian and teacher, mysteriously disappears. Some time later he receives a parcel from his father containing a Reflector device and instructions on how to use it. The device would allow Takuya to travel to parallel worlds. At first he doesn't take it seriously, but soon realizes that the device works indeed, effectively allowing him to experiment different alternative realities and travel between them.\n\nUnique to the game, is the A.D.M.S. (Auto Diverge Mapping System), which is a visual representation of the several branches formed from decisions taken in the story, helping the player understand where he can explore new possibilities as well as go back, if something goes wrong. Similar systems would later be used in many other games of this genre.\n\nThe original PC-98 game contained erotic content that have been heavily toned down in the PS4/Vita/Switch versions, which contains no nudity or explicit sex scenes. Similarly to what was edited in the Sega Saturn version. Although adult innuendo is still present, with several adult themes such as incest.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/megbxFqGy80","Platform":"Nintendo Switch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure; Visual Novel","Developer":"5pb.","Publisher":"Spike Chunsoft","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-14T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"afd15451-c46c-4572-a711-70fe2fd4791b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"03056e59-9819-4507-ac23-7cd35f357a27.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"0243c674-07c0-4433-ad4b-4fc0e439327b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"2f5a341b-5577-4298-a44a-d91c48da0fb1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"19c13cb0-f06e-4ab9-94a9-b34dca366d09.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"453af336-f9be-4cfc-9adc-035c39dec722.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"f061b5aa-c1a1-4440-ac64-aa3de563fe49.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"d0bcf6de-0154-48b9-a17c-87afe5858b08.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"192b2529-bb20-4b9c-a4d5-f7b39b299d11.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"67073b5e-7eed-48c8-8ae6-461ec1c8a5d0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185436,"FileName":"0cf37555-0597-498c-9202-7170bfd5156b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185436,"AlternateName":"Yu-No: Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shōjo","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":202507,"Name":"Yuppie Psycho: Executive Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Make it through your first day at Sintracorp in the world’s only; First Job, Survival Horror!\nJoin Brian Pasternack, a young man with no future in a dystopian 90s society, on his first day at one of the world’s largest companies, Sintracorp.
