The player can choose between five different characters from the time period, and fight other characters in either a one-on-one combat or a story mode. \n\nThe story is loosely based on real historical events of the Three Kingdoms era: towards the end of the Han Dynasty, China was controlled by the Emperor Ling, who was in turn controlled by ten of his servants in the royal palace. This created a convenient atmosphere for bandits, and the land was in turmoil. Then the Emperor ordered the ten dukes to take it on themselves to restore peace in the land, but the dukes instead fought amongst themselves. Finally, the duke Cao Cao took the Emperor captive and he now controls the realm. The player, however, must use five fighters to take on Cao Cao's forces and restore equilibrium to the land.\n\nThis version is a port of the DOS original that changes a few things such as adding new attacks and parallax scrolling backgrounds, though the story mode and bonus game are absent leaving only the arcade and VS modes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ei2MMPsskY&t=20s","Platform":"Funtech Super Acan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Panda","Publisher":"Panda","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"3a96a5d7-c3c1-4731-a228-6e3246bfba7f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"aaf0e011-75ed-48f7-aff1-6c1236e3a715.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"ad173be9-3fb2-40ac-a0c2-bcf46c86931a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"26281978-1a02-4cee-8c0c-df0c948d5097.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"e38bded0-3583-4ba0-8e05-72e9980f7535.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"0116dcf1-c8ba-41e9-8e50-32024040fb6c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"5d21c71c-468f-4d13-bb5d-d752d1a9c238.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"3dc1f674-439d-43e3-a640-ab0252bdae20.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"2265efd6-015c-47ab-bdff-821046ca33fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"8fb500ea-5b33-4358-b96c-9ad743a3c2f1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":90500,"FileName":"48c01e9d-2bb6-4190-ac82-33af52018857.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":90500,"AlternateName":"Sango Fighter","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":127745,"Name":"Super Light Saga: Dragon Force","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Super Dragon Force is a port of a Taiwanese DOS Strategy RPG very similar to Shining Force.

It plays in a manner similar to popular JRPGs like Final Fantasy IV but with more emphasis on personal choice.  The player has branching dialogue paths with even trivial NPCs as well as in more plot critical moments which can change events in the game and even make the protagonist good or evil.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxRhvqAEcNA","Platform":"Funtech Super Acan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Funtech","Publisher":"Funtech Entertainment","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"c4899ab9-4780-4685-9032-178540825cc1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"6356550f-48cd-49e8-973b-391f14c51b6e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"49ff27dd-a994-4ace-9ac7-8effbeea0255.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"ad51bd96-b482-46a1-99eb-bf0aaf5eddbe.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"f90f45de-8105-4017-9bd4-8a44b06e8100.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"66901774-9e7e-4901-adc5-7ed914433712.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"a3806335-8625-4ffb-8b25-d151bd4573af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126263,"FileName":"1e97f77c-39a8-4b8e-84b6-3726ea836f78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":126263,"AlternateName":"The Son of Evil","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":105630,"Name":"Yīnsù Fēilóng","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Yinsu Feilong (Speedy Dragon) is a colourful platform action game comparable to the Sonic the Hedgehog series which was released exclusively for the Taiwanese Super A'Can.\n\n\n\nPlaying as a determined-looking young man with a baseball bat, the player must make their way through six side-scrolling stages, each with a boss at the end that must be defeated.\n\n\n\nThe boy can run quite fast by building up momentum, as well as charge up and dash forward in a burst of speed, much like Sonic's famous spin-dash. He can also use his baseball bat, always at the ready, to attack any foes he encounters. There are baseballs strewn around each stage, which give points when collected, as well as item capsules and springs that send the boy careening off at high speed. There is also a 3D bonus stage similar to Space Harrier in which bonus baseballs can be collected.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvAMWT9SnUA","Platform":"Funtech Super Acan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"AV artisan","Publisher":"Funtech Entertainment","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"daaf2a99-012f-4835-8bd1-a43f72e6f999.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"8c5aa831-1a5c-453f-83f6-ae23688241e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"775bbf1c-45a1-4f63-b559-4dcf176abd0a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"China"},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"be988f83-a272-4695-b312-5d4fff26f643.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"5c708761-dde7-4f69-904d-8f51ace3965a.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"7bcdd013-1447-4817-b713-fde571316c4d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"79ab89a6-7ee2-454c-ba38-dbbdb01207e1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"26b1b428-53d5-476c-986d-b06122246f96.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"f2e1e93b-fcf8-4a06-8c4e-2fb549f969a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"03f6fdea-f9d0-487d-84b0-a765a54e5658.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105630,"FileName":"6616f010-1c87-41af-aa52-a51391c7e3d8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":105630,"AlternateName":"Speedy Dragon","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105630,"AlternateName":"Sonic Dragon","Region":"China"}]}]}
