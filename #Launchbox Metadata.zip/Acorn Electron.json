{"Name":"Acorn Electron","Games":[{"DatabaseID":192978,"Name":"$wag","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are out to steal £250,000 in diamonds before your rival. You accomplish this by collecting the heaps of diamonds which appear on the screen, and taking them to the cache in your house. Unfortunately the other robber is not your only problem. There are several killer droids, employed by one of the insurance companies, to try to apprehend bandits such as yourself and recover the swag.\n\nThere are two types of droids, Henrys and Percys. One type will try to catch you, the other your opponent. You can \"convert\" one which is following you by shooting it. You can also shoot the other player's man, and if caught by a droid or shot, you will drop your swag and be returned to your house. Naturally you will soon use up all the ammunition in your gun, but you can get more by depositing gold in the bank. The other way to convert droids is to move onto a DH, which changes all Henrys to Percys, and vice versa. Moving onto a Smiley has the effect of sending your opponent back to his house. If you shoot a police car it will follow you around the screen, which gives points to the other player, though you can stop this by drinking a car of beer (the sort which refreshed the parts other beers can't) and shooting them again.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Dave Herbert","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":"1985-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"72282f08-631f-4f88-9ac1-7351a6ad45b4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"aa79cb1b-1274-429d-848a-ae2cd8c14d67.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"2bfecd22-e1f7-47ed-922a-eb277503f8b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"39254d4e-2575-44f5-9384-32e9817d29ae.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"89cc9794-aad3-42a5-8818-3a6877973690.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"b52a0ca9-c300-4fed-8ac8-00bf615b166b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192978,"FileName":"553531b8-b80b-424b-ac6b-b99741d02eba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":192978,"AlternateName":"Swag","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":131146,"Name":"2002: A Space Oddity","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A comedic text adventure satire of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a A Space Odyssey.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvOOWkGbmaA","Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"A&B Computing","Publisher":"A&B Computing","ReleaseDate":"1984-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":131146,"FileName":"ac6869bf-1398-414b-a241-9eedb87db7a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131146,"FileName":"2c7987c7-8241-430f-b739-be099bf40590.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131146,"FileName":"41ce81a2-fc1c-411a-bb27-cf8fc4c954bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124816,"Name":"3D Bomb Alley","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"3D Bomb Alley is a video game created by Simon Vout and published by Software Invasion for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

As the protagonist explores the streets and souvenir shops, certain people, animals and objects begin exhibiting strange behavior; finally, the surroundings become completely unfamiliar, and the inhabitants' English unusually rich and poetic... the stage is set for an exploration of this strange land, in an attempt to find a way out. The happenings take place over three different calendar dates; the game world is a blend of places and characters from Shakespeare's plays, but as the authors reassure us, \"an exhaustive knowledge of the Shakespearean Canon is not necessary\".\n\nMonsters of Murdac is billed as a bonus game, in which an expatriate known only as George takes a flight from England back to his native land of Murdac. Here he meets a mysterious old lady remembered from his childhood, rumored to be a witch (in any case, she's at least somewhat unconventional). A stop at her strangely-furnished home proves fateful, as the hero finds himself sent on a quest deep into the foreboding forest of Murdac.

Ballistix also keeps certain physics laws (namely gravity and friction), and will present you with varying obstacles in either one or two player mode.\n\nThe game's cover art is a painting by Melvyn Grant called Steel Tsar. It was originally used as the cover for Michael Moorcock's 1981 novel The Steel Tsar, and also appeared on the 1987 reissue of Rocka Rolla, the first album by British heavy metal band Judas Priest.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Reflections Interactive","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"c011e1d4-8ed3-4e8b-a2f3-d78eeae75a9a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"e9183ac1-f6ee-46ee-8ff5-2b942695239f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"819ed48f-2539-4b54-843e-1bdae69f0072.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"a57e0dae-89a1-4c4e-9746-3571a51f8ec1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"5847847f-5722-469b-a543-07e921b13cc4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"e63eba48-ae28-4741-bd5f-9dc1798a9b82.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"2261b7dc-420f-4f66-8d75-3dab9726bc6a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"f6d6cace-b706-4452-8eee-f171a0119e22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119664,"FileName":"ccfd6735-4757-4c24-b49b-82edde29831b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123241,"Name":"Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax is a video game first published in 1988 for various home computers.

This was the latest and most sophisticated computer version of the concept.\n\nThe exact mechanics of the game have been customized slightly. You start by choosing a question, which are all represented by the first letter of the answer. You must 'buzz in' by pressing your letter to input the answer (don't worry about exact spelling).

The main goal of the game is to collect 3000 points by recovering bags of gold scattered around the flip-screen castle the game is set in. Killing enemies also increases the score, though in less amounts.\n\nThe game consists of shooting, platform and some puzzle elements. Fighting various creatures, like witches and demons, is preferably done by shooting fireballs at them, of which there is a finite amount at the player's disposal. In addition to enemies, various hazards, like pools of water, may additionally drain the player's energy and thus need to be avoided. It's possible to pick up and carry up to 5 different objects. Collecting a key for example can give access to a different area. The protagonist's only life is lost when either all of his energy gets drained or the time limit runs out, both however, may be replenished through the course of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Tony Oakden","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":"1989-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"04a81fe6-9774-4228-8d5b-8fddd3f5885b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"a2825363-98e3-465d-8293-56f04f1b3099.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"39e3dc09-bcec-4fc1-9e06-4135f7745e81.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"344b934b-858c-4d45-9b30-ef9c2cde5be7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"d1056657-19de-4e7f-ae2a-0ec872424700.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"8b7059e7-6dca-4256-9bdc-8a3e8696b846.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"64175d5e-5d64-4213-9c4a-59ac30ff8463.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35228,"FileName":"5bbd5a82-a919-4bff-a73e-520ce220da82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192853,"Name":"Castle Assault","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A glittering reward awaits the intrepid atop the heavily defended towering turrets of this forbidding fortress.

The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.\n\nThere are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX84P8rnm4A","Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Doug Anderson","Publisher":"A&F Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126288,"FileName":"4d9bf3f3-4704-4c58-a9fa-8b159ca6f192.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126288,"FileName":"5691e59f-cf25-4b0d-9345-e4a4c0e7fe41.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126288,"FileName":"2333b1d5-4981-4a2f-a27b-6e1e68d88ea8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126288,"FileName":"aa0b31f3-8020-48af-9b62-49dc6c5ec6b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126288,"FileName":"9382da7d-5d2a-4439-b3fa-39fe8164f04e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192874,"Name":"Circus","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"The seventh in the Mysterious Adventure series of illustrated text adventures by Brian Howarth.

Grounded on Doom, your ship is both damaged, and threatened with total disintegration due to the corrosive effects of the Doom atmosphere. Repairs to the ship must be made before you can escape, and there's also a tempting array of treasure to be collected; but the clock is ticking away all the while, and it's only a matter of time before the ship will disappear in a cloud of dust, whereupon you must resign yourself to a life in the wilderness of Doom.\n\nThis ROM Cartridge is designed for use with the Electron Plus 1.\n\nAs you play the game, you'll find that you will want to SAVE a game at a particular point (for example, before doing something risky, or simply to return to the game at a later time). You will be prompted to find a suitable area on one of your tapes, followed by the usual \"RECORD then RETURN\" message. This will put the 'dynamic' part of the database onto tape - this is the part which attends to the general house-keeping - where you are, where the objects are etc. The file is automatically called INIT so if you make several SAVEs, you'll need to keep track of which INIT is where.\n\nIf you wish to restart at one of these positions, load the program as usual, but select S to start from a saved position. You'll be asked to Position the database file. Locate the saved position on tape, set it playing, and press RETURN. Once INIT is loaded (about 45 seconds) the game will start from where you left off.\n\nShould you QUIT or die, you'll be asked if you want another game. \"Y\" or \"y\" will return you to the start of the game; \"N\" or \"n\" will simply end it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131577,"FileName":"83327757-dc73-4ab9-b35c-26a1946897c9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":131577,"FileName":"c7a4da08-38bd-4d14-a8f9-3b470c9f0c25.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131577,"FileName":"ad520ff6-6a18-492b-8882-2f73b7d4c20d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131577,"FileName":"53821e62-6e5c-473c-b4d0-dfdf12dc5f88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131577,"FileName":"fb44db81-27c1-4f1d-86ad-897ad93aaa7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131958,"Name":"Crack-Up","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Joystick or Keyboard. 100% Arcade Action. 100 years from now, when war is a distant memory and mindless violence is considered the ultimate in anti-social behaviour, what outlet will there be for your feeling of aggression?

Enemies generate in random positions when a room is entered.

In the first level, one item is needed and the player faces only slow moving \"Spinners\". In the second level, two items are needed and unpredictable \"Clones\" are added, that shoot back. In the third level, three items are needed, and the \"Cyber-droid\" is introduced. The player starts with five lives, and is awarded an extra life at regular score intervals, on reaching a new level, and on collecting a potion.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":"1984-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192883,"FileName":"1eb05ef5-c1fa-4da8-9c64-d3abcd21a320.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192883,"FileName":"88a56909-9bc9-450f-90d0-2e6874279f54.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192883,"FileName":"daf2b4df-26dd-4754-b54f-2c17fba80996.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192883,"FileName":"5961ba8c-22dc-436c-b890-0826c26d4bcb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131144,"Name":"Cylon Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A 3D space battle.

You play the part of Theodore, an athletic young chap who wanders the various tunnels of the system in search of a way out. But the sewers are inhabited by mutant sewer creatures who get washed down the drains at the top and slither down to the bottom. During their dangerous descent, you must either avoid or kill them. This is achieved by head-butting them up through the floor so that they fall over, then kicking them out of the way. If you fail to kick them, they will get back up and pursue you even more viciously than ever!\n\nAny encounter with the creatures will result in death. Each creature has a different resistance to head-butts - some require more than one butt to make them fall over. Butting the Zap block causes all creatures on the screen to die, but this can only be used three times. Occasionally, water or fire balls are ejected from the pipes. These must be avoided.\n\nCoins lost down the gutters are hanging from the ceilings. These can be collected, and if you get a tunnel full of coins, you should try to collect them all before the beasties catch up with you.\n\nYou can move left and right or jump, but beware of the slime underfoot. Some tunnels have different slipperiness factors, so tread carefully. You can avoid death by becoming invisible, but only for a short time on each screen. You get a bonus life and extra Zap block at 10,000 and 30,000 points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Icon Software","Publisher":"Icon","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192900,"FileName":"cae2c7ce-a844-4917-9542-0dda48d803bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192900,"FileName":"998eb90c-3b91-40d1-bc93-92d178d672b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192900,"FileName":"0825994f-7158-4d73-8c8a-7462cd627c49.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192900,"FileName":"234b3348-b4a1-41a9-becb-96f7528d72b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192900,"FileName":"6616c702-806f-4849-9e43-c4867868b6f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":192900,"FileName":"2b6b55a4-fa28-4e5e-a6e5-7099bc6c8c0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131638,"Name":"Draughts and Reversi ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Draughts : The traditional game has been faithfully reproduced on screen for you to try your hand at playing the computer.

Exile's game physics engine qualifies it to be the first game to have a complete Newtonian motion model. At the time of its release it was considered to push the boundaries of what was possible on home computers, particularly on the 8-bit platforms. It remains probably the most complex game available for the BBC Micro. The game was designed and programmed by Peter Irvin (author of Starship Command, a space shoot-em-up with an innovative control system) and Jeremy Smith (author of Thrust, a game based on cave exploration with a simpler physics model).\n\nNote:\nThe standard 32 kB BBC Model B version uses a specially defined screen resolution, smaller than full screen MODE 2. This is to free up video memory for game data - a common technique employed in complex BBC games.\nThe simplified video hardware found in the Electron does not support this, so the additional machine-code data remains visible around the screen border.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Peter Irvin","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-04T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"a4b8c7a8-0a00-485b-9cdc-00da75e6586b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"082bb2c1-d7ba-45e9-b614-0f87155d278a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"ff5dff72-af5a-42dd-996c-aec014a15210.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"97426bac-e0ea-4079-badf-09f7a8bf4313.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"160a2bfb-bf22-4921-aed4-76d559ee3945.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"dff9164c-e552-4d82-9442-a657d2354a06.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"bebec273-12b2-4b40-ac84-0041897208e2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"3cd1ae1c-85a6-4c82-b649-63f0f83eb0c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":35234,"FileName":"ba572ebb-1064-4fa9-bda3-ab0e90a7d46d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192905,"Name":"Exploring Adventures on the Electron","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"This is a complete look at the fabulous world of Adventure Games for the Electron Computer.

Your energy is replenished by ten units if you pass over the power cells at each corner of the maze. If a monster reaches a piece of fruit it will pause momentarily to absorb its energy and then mutate. After each mutation, the monster will become more aggressive and faster. A life is lost if the player is caught by the monster or runs out of energy.

It is a powerful program for either one or two players, plus an option where the computer plays against itself. The program will only accept legal moves so beginners can experiment and let the program teach t hem how to play.\n\nPlayers start with a blank grid and take it in turns to place markers at the points where the grid lines intersect; the main aim is to occupy as much territory as possible and then to capture enemy markers, or groups, by surrounding them.\n\nMarkers of the same colour joined together along the lines of the grid are a group and can be captured when an opposing marker is placed on the group's last liberty point. Liberties are the adjacent intersections to a single or group of markers. Markers cannot be joined across diagonals to form groups.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131627,"FileName":"dde73678-c13f-432b-a50f-2fd444fc2df1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":131627,"FileName":"5486c6d7-97b9-4dd2-baf4-0825ad19ef6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131627,"FileName":"e934fa19-722a-4f58-bf46-d1e6cfd77a01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131627,"FileName":"f85150d1-435f-44d8-9989-a5beea3cbd90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192980,"Name":"Goal!","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Goal! is a simple football game with a perspective similar to Commodore's International Soccer although without scrolling.

These take place on May Day when the hobby horse dances through the crowd grabbing at and bumping into watching spectators.\n\nAfter the celebrations you become engaged in conversation with a couple of old Cornishmen in one of the taverns. When you inform them of your interest in legends and folklore, they start to mention the local legend of a witch named Vianna who lived by the coast between Padstow and Bude, farther north.\n\nA couple of hundred years ago, the woman Vianna was accused of being a witch and was put to death. The people say, however, that at certain times she returns to stalk the night along with various demons and familiars which she conjures up to help her in whatever diabolical deeds she performs.\n\nNow that King Edward has succeeded to the throne, people are less likely to be alarmed by ghost stories and witchcraft in these modern Edwardian days. However, in recent years there have still been a number of respectable people reporting eerie occurrences. Why, only last year a local doctor reported hearing the sound of voices and the whinnying of horses on the moors whilst there was no sign to be seen of anybody.\n\nThese days, however, Vianna is more euphemistically referred to as Vi and many scoff at the mention of witchcraft.\n\nOne of the men to whom you are talking mentions that he is driving in the morning to Bude and that he will happily offer you a seat on his carriage so that you can visit the village where Vianna lived.\n\nSo it is that the following day, the man drops you off after a journey of about an hour or so and continues on his way Northwards.\n\n\"If you should meet the old witch, give her my regards,\" he laughs as the carriage is driven away.\n\nNow is it my imagination, or is it just a little bit more chilly than it was a moment ago?","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Geoffrey Hans Larsen","Publisher":"Larsoft","ReleaseDate":"1988-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192997,"FileName":"4f4ae805-4ff1-429e-82a4-e1a51d323099.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":192997,"FileName":"a02d2b67-bcc9-4ff2-9a52-29a383e2543c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90435,"Name":"Hezarin","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"You have been transported to the strange and wondrous land of Hezarin, a world held in the grip of an evil tyrant - the sorceror Arijith. As a sworn-in member of the Adventurers' Guild, you cannot ignore the inhabitants' plea for help, and although no doubt this will not stop you from acquiring the odd treasure along the way, your ultimate task is to overcome the tyrant and free the peasants from his oppressive reign...\nRumour has it that the Ruling Council of Hezarin, an imniscient body that works in mysterious ways, foresaw the rule of the old tyrant and crafted a magic device, in the form of an old panelled box, which could be used to overcome him; but over the passage of time the box has been lost and the secret of its use forgotten. Other sources say that Arijith himself consigned the box to a secret location deep in the bowels of the earth, and has woven dark spells and set hidden traps so that no ordinary man may chance upon it...\nYou start your exploration in a large field out of which rises an out-crop of glistening white limestone. To the north lies thick forest, to the west an apparently infinite plain, and to the east a thick hedge.

Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey (not on the Commodore 16), Darts and Ping Pong (not on the European Commodore 64 releases) are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game.\n\nTen-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.\n\nDarts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.\n\nAir Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.\n\nPing-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"DesignStar Consultants, Inc.","Publisher":"Tynesoft","ReleaseDate":"1988-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192985,"FileName":"29179259-66e6-49c4-87fb-a4daa42f5314.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":192985,"FileName":"19835cb6-40e1-4a5c-aac0-a9e20467e831.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192972,"Name":"Intergalactic Trader","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The object of the game is to mine asteroids which contain a rare ore.

The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump.\n\nEnemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him.\n\nThere are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten).

Inside the building is a multi-level security system, each level consisting of a maze of corridors patrolled by robot guards who will shoot you on sight.\n\nThe robots are armed with guns which they can recharge by running over special power points which are marked by pentangles on the floor of the maze.\n\nYour company's scientists have been able to duplicate the design of these guns so that you too are able to replenish your ammunition by running over the power points. You have a maximum of three bullets at any one time.\n\nThe only exit from each level is a computer-controlled lift, programmed to open its doors only when triggered by an electronic security key; a separate key is needed at each level. This key can be found in an indestructible iridium box somewhere in the maze. The box can only be opened when three coloured idenity tags have been dropped into it. These three tags; red, blue and green, are randomly positioned in the maze. When you have collected all three, take them to the box and drop them. The box will open automatically and you can take the key.\n\nTo help you find your way about, you have an advanced electronic compass. This will remember the layout of all the corridors as you explore them and can automatically detect the positions of the guards. The compass will also remember the positions of power points and the box containing the key once you have found them.\n\nThe compass can display a plan view of the maze at any time showing all the features you have so far encountered.\n\nWhen you have the key, take it to the lift which will open as you approach and carry you to the next level. Higher levels are protected by more guards and have fewer power points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOcOnX65gko","Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131620,"FileName":"cab7e374-75af-4482-ba16-e8cfefab3b9d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":131620,"FileName":"a3b9bd62-e6c2-48e4-b289-c52a316845c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131620,"FileName":"da5ea0cf-01db-4c4e-bedb-c1e85ec532c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131573,"Name":"Me And My Micro","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Comprises: Anagrams (Acornsoft), Bomber (Acornsoft), Kongo (Acornsoft), Matchem (Acornsoft), Mazerace (Acornsoft), Monsterzap (Acornsoft), Pairs (Acornsoft) and Twister (Acornsoft)","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow9NGg_xYd0","Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131573,"FileName":"b2622462-2bd0-4f2e-844b-29a136d87014.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":131573,"FileName":"9110da5b-ddfe-4021-a9be-4a0b669a90e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131621,"Name":"Meteors","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"\"Steer your laser-ship through a hall of meteors smashing them with your laser bolts as they hurtle towards you on all sides.

This pack contains programs on cassette plus instructions for Philosopher's Quest, an 'intelligent' adventure where the player explores a strange land full of weird and unlikely things, some dangerous and some even magical.\n\nIn this new and authentic game the concept of the adventure is exploited to the full, and extended to include abstract thought as a means to progress and survival. However, wild speculation will get you nowhere - you have to use your wits!\n\nThe objective is to find all the treasures and bring them to where you began, but in the meantime you have to sift clues, weigh up risks, spot magic words and remember which way you came!\n\nThe game starts with a description of your immediate surroundings, and a choice of objects which you can take with you (use \"TAKE\" followed by the name of the object) on your quest. Choose carefully, before setting off with a command such as \"WEST\" if you want to try going west, or \"NE\" to go to the northeast.\n\nThe computer becomes your eyes and hands. It will tell you what you can see and what is happening around you. You must tell it, in return, what to do (it prompts you with a colon). Use commands of one or two words (in upper case).\n\nThe computer only looks at the first four letters of any word you type, so that the command \"NORTHEAST\" must be typed in as \"NE\" to distinguish it from \"NORTH\" (or \"N\" - there are various abbreviations you will pick up as you go).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131635,"FileName":"4d88f7fb-79e2-4b0c-ac7a-45d070325c4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131635,"FileName":"e829e663-641f-436a-a92a-f901bfdc2984.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131635,"FileName":"d190ecbe-14f8-4a9c-89c8-62b7b8b77bcc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":131635,"FileName":"72c8cc90-85be-48e0-8bb1-d91af1193a3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131635,"FileName":"55e624e2-1110-4299-bd87-8e8cfd295daa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131635,"FileName":"187320d7-7dd6-4bda-b8e0-2814cfc33ad1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193057,"Name":"Pipe Mania","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pipemania is a game of great ingenuity, simple in concept and fiendishly challenging to play.

One wrong move, one brief hesitation or mis-placed pipe section, and you'll drown in a sea of slime!\n\nForget Shoot-'em-ups and Beat-'em-ups, once you play this you'll know why. Buy it now!\n\nPipemania starts on a playing grid that is empty except for the starting piece. The object is to score as many points as possible by constructing a continuous pipeline from the starting piece.\n\nAs you play, pipe sections appear in a dispenser to the left of the grid. You can place a pipe section anywhere you like, whether or not it connects with other pipe sections. In fact, you'll learn to place pieces in a pattern that anticipates connections five or ten moves in advance.\n\nYou can \"bomb\" any previously placed pipe section by placing a new section on top of it. The old pipe will spin and the new pipe appear in its place. There is a short delay for replacing pipes and a 50 point penalty.\n\nOnce a pipe piece fills with flooz, you can no longer replace it. At the start of higher levels, advanced pipe sections and obstacles will appear randomly on the grid. These pieces cannot be replaced by other pieces.\n\nWith each level you have a set amount of time in which to connect as many pipe sections as possible before the flooz starts to flow. This time decreases as you progress up through the levels. When the flooz reaches the end of your pipeline the round is over.\n\nOnce you've placed all the pipe pieces you can (or want to) press CTRL and COPY and the flooz will speed up and end the round quickly.

It features a number of new features and changes from the original formula. The biggest change is that instead of separate levels it now features one big world where each sector is connected with teleporters. The basic gameplay is very similar though. The player digs his way through the dirt in search for diamonds and other objects and has to watch out for falling boulders or monsters (reptiles) that are out for him. Monsters appear from cracked eggs and will kill the player if he comes into contact with them. They can be killed with falling boulders. There are also spirits who follow the walls to their left until they reach a cage. In the cage the spirit transforms into a diamond. To get all the diamonds the player therefore has to guide all the spirits to their cages. The player can also collect jigsaw puzzle pieces. These will then appear at the first screen and form the sentence \"Repton 2 Is Ended\". On the topmost levels of the world the player has to watch out for meteors that fall from the sky. The game involves more than just collecting diamonds. To complete the game the player has to do all of the following: collect all of the 4,744 earth sections collect all of the 1,634 diamonds kill all of the 18 monsters use all of the 64 transporters collect all of the 42 jigsaw puzzle pieces collect a \"finish character\" Unlike the original game there is no time limit in Repton 2. Neither are there any save options so the player has to complete the whole game in one sitting.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Tim Tyler","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":"1985-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135078,"FileName":"c6e40394-ce3b-4643-b959-9d9a386a7060.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135078,"FileName":"4b678907-b140-49a0-8a79-55cb722c4f22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135078,"FileName":"fa7e7734-c08f-4798-87c5-653141215443.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135078,"FileName":"df743ed5-8f6f-40a9-983a-18da8a82e147.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135078,"FileName":"ed8357f2-9d9c-4781-bb7a-8de7d68ee59d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":35238,"Name":"Repton 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Repton 3, released 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler wasn't interested in programming it—although he did design some of the levels for the new game.

Repton 4 plays like previous Repton games but features some new objects. Jewels and banknotes have to be collected to score points while the player also has to watch out for ghouls that hatch out of cracked eggs, spirits that have to be guided into cages and fungi that grow when unattended. There are also magiblocks that transform into treasures when pushed into a row of three and photocopiers that can be used to duplicate objects. In Robbo the player controls a robot and has to collect flashing orbs and solve puzzles to get points. Puzzles include tasks like repairing a computer or lighting a bulb. In Trakker the player controls a bulldozer and has to get rid of creatures known as Hideous Jaggas. These can be killed by setting off dynamite or squashed with tomatoes.

Wherewas they all have distinct movement patterns in the original, here they behave the same, each patrolling one corner of the maze, but are let out of their pen in the centre of the screen at different times, with the red one being let out first.

Once inside the halls of spirit it will be very dark and the player risks falling into a pit. Therefore finding a source of light might be necessary. At times the player might come across various fantasy creatures such as dwarfs, ogres and dragons that attack the player. These can be fought, either with bare hands or with some of the weapons that can be found throughout the game world. There is also magic involved and at times a wand has to be used.

The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.\n\nAcquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator","Developer":"H&H Software","Publisher":"Mirrorsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"35e393f4-dd38-4109-a0f2-9459aadb1aa0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"ef1b2730-c598-4092-94a0-634623a597c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"426cda03-ac90-472c-9910-5aa90235a812.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"bc9f19af-a12a-43b2-87d7-2eee41f52ed7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"3e7effc4-fdfb-4fac-aac7-ba25f4491db1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"3f984831-4353-4aa7-a8b8-2dc049f08e98.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"d0530558-0fbc-41ac-8fe5-d7d41e0b0156.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193010,"FileName":"7b260b48-3f26-4a33-bb9f-a6a97639d273.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131932,"Name":"Strip Poker II Plus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A sizzling and exciting game of poker awaits you as you pit your skills against Donna and Sam in a game of Poker.

In Underground Escape, you are climbing up a mine shaft, when it is blocked by rocks. You have to find common factors to get through. These ideas all come together in Number Families. It's easy to play this game, but to get the best scores needs a lot of thought.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Laurie Buxton","Publisher":"ASK","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132067,"FileName":"4fd80fce-76eb-4253-9e55-5299878ca59b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":132067,"FileName":"a6153836-9419-4cfb-98ac-96123fa52672.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132067,"FileName":"e4aa2142-1452-4f4e-8706-0da97d3bcb66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193078,"Name":"Tank Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tank Attack is a computer/board game for two, three or four players where each player takes the role of the General commanding a country's Tank Corps of one or more armoured divisions. Your objective is to capture the enemy headquarters which will require the planned strategic deployment of your forces and regular fire duels between your own and enemy units.\n\nWeather, morale, skill, judgement, planning, foresight, careful management of rebuild and repair facilities and luck, all play a part in deciding the result of each game.\n\nThe computer issues all movement orders, the result of fire duels, the status of each unit and a daily newspaper, 'War News', which gives a full report on each day's fighting and the weather prospects for the next day.\n\nOne of the unique features of Tank Attack is the alliances which are formed before war is declared. There are four countries which actually form two alliances - Armania with Kazaldis and Sarapan with Calderon. Allies share rebuilding facilities and have a mutual interest in keeping their joint territory clear of invasion due to their close physical proximity.\n\nAllies never oppose each other but battle together against the other two countries. Players will need to interact off the board in order to maintain their alliances since certain resources are shared by allies and their joint objective is to capture all enemy Headquarters.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"CDS Software Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1989-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193078,"FileName":"88b730fc-7cdd-469c-9f3a-e41b5573dde3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131837,"Name":"Tarzan Boy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Four inviting screens invite you to:\n\nrun the jungle path,\njump the torrential rivers,\ncross the moving lifts, and\nfollow the signposted arrows that escort you to Jane\nThen cross the great divide.

The simplest tesselation can be seen in the tiling of a bathroom wall. Square tiles arranged in rows will cover the wall completely but circular tiles, no matter how they are arranged, will always have gaps between them. Squares, then, will tesselate, circules will not. Rectangles, hexagons and some triangles are other well-known tesselating shapes.\n\nMany artists and designers have used tesselations in their work. Usually this has meant long hours of 'trial and error' as it is not always easy to see if even quite simple shapes will tesselate. Now, with the programs in Tesselator you can avoid all the donkey-word, and experiment freely with complex and natural patterns, gaining a deep insight into this fascinating area of geometric art.\n\nTesselator is divided into four sections, each of which concentrates on a particular aspect of the subject.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Addison-Wesley","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":131667,"FileName":"44a72b71-956f-4df0-8ea9-3ec9a073dc64.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":131667,"FileName":"70748601-e404-4a78-ae14-af75d4026bbb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":131667,"FileName":"5ff02a1b-eb3a-43b9-aaff-09131c16e25a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193015,"Name":"Tetris","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mirrorsoft's version of Tetris, which was the first commercially available version of the game.\n\nA variety of differently shaped blocks fall, one by one, from the top of the screen, or playfield.

In the program, contestants were given cryptic clues which led from one location to another. They had to decipher these clues and direct a real-life TV presenter and her camera crew to those locations in a helicopter.\n\nThe game follows the same pattern. It comes with a 60+ page book containing extracts from Ernest Benn's 'Blue Book' guides to England, Scotland and Wales, however the instructions do say that a large scale map would be useful too. The game consists of four hunts\nGreater London\nSouth Devon\nAnglesey\nThe Fife Peninsular\nThe best way to describe the game is to follow one of the clues. The third hunt is based on and around Anglesey, an island off the North West coast of Wales.\nThe first clue is 'Pass lop-sided nobleman to the place of churning water to replace missing member'.\nThe player is given 10 seconds to read the clue and then the game begins. Reading the book the player will find that to the west of the start location is the Anglesey Column which is dedicated to the Marquis of Anglesey who lost a leg at Waterloo, hence lop-sided. A little further away is Llanfair P. G., noted for having one of the longest place names in the world and which, when translated, refers to a rapid whirlpool, hence churning water. Both of these are pointers to the first destination. The helicopter on the ground by the Menai Bridge. The player instructs the pilot to 'TAKE OFF' and then types the name of the town / geographic feature that they think the clue refers to. After a while the helicopter lands and the player is either given the next clue, or is told 'No Clue Here'.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation; Quiz; Education","Developer":"Macsen Software","Publisher":"Mascen Software","ReleaseDate":"1986-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":193081,"FileName":"b9454915-1cba-46fe-96cd-b0ac4f6b5139.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":193081,"FileName":"c7118630-d27a-4421-8ced-0325781e5d28.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":193081,"FileName":"6d4310ed-0452-460f-b4e7-7509c9ec55bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":131641,"Name":"Tree of Knowledge","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The Tree Of Knowledge is an interactive program which teaches categorization.

Your quest is to obtain the three parts to the crown of Ultimate Darkness. Each part of the crown is located in each of the three lands of Ramagold; Lannia - a greenland, Durnin - a desertland and Zarthynia - an iceland. In each land are four buildings; a Bazaar, a Sanctuary, a Tomb and a Ruin. Bazaar Essentially a shop where you can use gold to purchase more warriors or food. Sanctuary If during the course of a game, your Warrior, Gold or Food levels fall below an acceptable level, you may enter the sanctuary. Tomb and Ruin These are battle arenas. Their role in the adventure is the same except only one contains the part of the crown. Do not enter either of these unless you consider you have sufficient warriors to do battle. Rewards are only obtained after defeating a number of Brigands in a battle. Any one of the following can be given as a reward: Warriors, Gold, Food, a Map, a Dragon Sword, a Magic Potion, a Piece of the Crown. The game was unknowingly re-released in 1986 as Bozo The Brave by Tynesoft.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Electron","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Icon Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164615,"FileName":"2dcd0879-d6fd-4df1-bb45-136acbb057f6.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":164615,"FileName":"c2697758-1d52-40d6-9a4c-1a2af5feb606.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":164615,"FileName":"7492ece9-ad37-4994-ac44-3cb8f64a2013.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":164615,"FileName":"b92fc3f9-5843-4575-aa76-abbbc19bd7e0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":164615,"FileName":"4468e425-db2a-4474-b7dd-d4529e96f9ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
