This town is crawling with ghosts! Stepping off the train at the depot, your objective is walk to the haunted house and back, blasting as many ghosts as you can along the way. Your weapon is your own design, a \"Ghost Blaster,\" capable of steady fire, though short, controlled bursts are the better option. The ghosts, of course, want you to panic. They're here to scare you to death, and to that end, each one that escapes will awaken the next, more dangerous ghost. When the thirteenth ghost appears, it's curtains for you.\n\nThis early first-person shooter presents you with a panoply of ghosts in classical forms drifting and darting across the detailed backdrop of a Western ghost town. As you shoot ghosts, you advance across the backdrop: bigger steps for more dangerous ghosts. Your passage is made more complicated by a laughing ghost whose head pops up briefly and must also be shot to prevent the ghost counter from ticking forward. Some help is provided by spiders, of whom the ghosts are afraid; shoot a spider and the ghost counter goes down, though then ghosts swarm back _en masse_. Your Ghost Blaster is represented by a movable sight on the screen, but it takes more than just a quick trigger finger to hit a ghost. You must lead your targets. This is the only sense of depth the game screen gives, except when that final ghost comes rushing out to get you.\n\nEach pass through town is rewarded with a musical refrain, which changes from level to level. A successful round trip moves you up one level, which changes the background slightly and treats you to clever names like \"Dead of Night\" and \"Good Mourning.\" There are bonus trips to be discovered and even a secret behind the appearance of spiders and the mysterious laughing head. If you beat all thirty-two levels, you are truly a Ghost Exterminator Extraordinaire.","Publisher":"Tandy Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"134922":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Attack Force (1980)(Big-5)","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bill Hogue","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5f86c1b2-64e8-4afb-8473-3fa0d66181b3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ca480db0-7528-4094-9ae3-22b31ddc1180.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"40657f24-5ee1-486c-9d95-30b2ac08ed09.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"31572b9b-e4e0-40b9-80a4-104f00362a4e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4ea56e35-2ca5-404b-9cb0-7361e6973eb3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"24f97b32-9039-4059-9981-ccd7eb1f9a05.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Attack Force","Overview":"Attack Force is a Targ variant.

However, the similarities are superficial and the games are very different. Your goal in Cosmic Fighter is to shoot the aliens as they descend from the top of the screen. Unlike Galaxy Invasion, you have a limited fuel supply which is used up as you move and shoot. A gauge at the top of the screen indicates how much fuel you have left. Your ship can be destroyed either by hitting an alien or shot or by simply running out of fuel. You are not likely to run out of fuel in the earlier levels of the game, but it does becomes an increasing problem in the later levels.\n\nAt the start of the game, an alien can be destroyed with a single one shot. In the later levels, it takes two or more shots to destroy an alien.\n\nIf you successfully destroy all of the aliens in a wave, then you move to the next wave. If some aliens do escape, then you still move to the next wave but your ship is positioned higher on the screen. This makes the game much harder because you have less time to shoot before the aliens can escape.\n\nAfter finishing a certain number of waves, you are required to dock your ship with a space station in order to refuel. The space station emerges from the side of the screen. It’s a bad idea to try to destroy the space station; if even a single shot hits it, it will promptly destroy you.\n\nOnce you press the D key, your ship will rise to meet the space station. The ship needs to be matched up just right or you will miss the docking area and smash against the space station. To complicate matters, a Flagship usually shows up at this point. But curiously, the Flagship doesn’t seem to want to shoot at you, instead reserving its wrath for the space station. It fires repeatedly at the station and gets in your way while you are attempting to dock. It is very difficult to shoot the Flagship because if you miss and hit the space station, the space station will destroy you.\n\nAfter a successfully docking, the game continues at a higher difficulty level.","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LpZ1jD4av28"},"134924":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Defense Command (1982)(Big-Five)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Five Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"192b9421-6a05-4117-9be6-b58d709c8745.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"63e6f0ac-5157-4524-815d-a469deaea40b.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6df00bcf-ef52-4188-a482-a1241d2bd466.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e49b3465-3632-44b6-9ede-5de5ac794617.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dc35d2ee-53a4-414d-9c81-919faf69c7d9.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0889a176-87eb-4a60-8445-844a1b7621fe.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Defense Command","Overview":"Defense Command was the last TRS‑80 game written by Bill Hogue. It was very loosely based by the arcade game Defender, which Williams Electronics released in 1980.\n\nThere were many Defender clones created for the TRS‑80. Notable examples include Alien Defense by Soft Sector Marketing, Penetrator by Melbourne House, and The Eliminator (the official Defender) by Adventure International.\n\nThe goal of Defender is to shoot aliens who are trying to carry away humanoids. Defender features a scrolling horizontal playing field and the player’s spaceship moves in all four directions.\n\nDefense Command features a stationary playing field with fuel cells positioned at the bottom of the screen. You can move only from side to side, but the aliens attack you from above. The aliens drop bombs and try to steal the fuel cells. If an alien manages to take a fuel cell and carry it off the top of the screen, then it is gone forever. However, if you shoot the alien before the fuel cell is gone, then the fuel cell will fall to the ground. If you catch it before it hits the ground, then you have saved it and receive extra points. But if the fuel cell hits the ground before you catch it, then it explodes and is lost for good.\n\nYou control the game using the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW to move, SPACEBAR to shoot, and the number keys to activate an Anti-Matter bomb, a smart bomb that destroys all the aliens on-screen. The game also supports a joystick. Moving the joystick left and right and firing works as expected, but moving the joystick up activates an Anti-Matter bomb. I always find this awkward because it is too easy to accidentally activate an Anti-Matter bomb, and you don’t have any to waste.\n\nLike many arcade-style games, Defense Command plays a sample game if it is left unattended. But unlike most games, the computer plays the game very well (much better than me). You can actually pick up pointers by watching the computer play the game itself.\n\nOne other unusual feature of Defense Command occurs at the start of the game. The Flagship and the other aliens escort the player and the fuel cells into place to set up the game. During this process, you can move but not shoot. You can receive many points by using an Anti-Matter bomb to destroy the aliens, but with the unfortunate side-effect of the aliens dropping the fuel cells they were carrying. There is no way to catch all the fuel cells (or even very many) and the game is effectively over. Defense Command is a very versatile game with many different ways to play.\n\nThe Flagship appears in Defense Command, but in an uncharacteristically benign role. Occasionally, a “Flagship Alert!” message appears and a Flagship moves slowly across the screen. The Flagship doesn’t shoot, but its appearance is designed to distract you. If you shoot the Flagship, then a group of aliens emerge from it and swarm down at you. You can either shoot as many of these aliens as possible, or use an Anti-Matter bomb to destroy them all.\n\nIf the number of fuel cells drops to one, then Slicers starts appearing. Each Slicer rotates as it falls straight down. You can destroy a Slicer with just one shot, but you must be directly underneath it. If a Slicer reaches the bottom of the screen, then it continues moving from side to side destroying everything it touches. It will destroy all the remaining fuel cells and the only thing that can stop it is an Anti-Matter Bomb.\n\nOnce all your fuel cells are gone, even if you have remaining lives, the game is over. A line of Solar Wasters descend in a pattern and destroy everything they touch. Nothing can destroy them, not even an Anti-Matter Bomb. At this point, the game is over.\n\nDefense Command has the best and clearest voices of any Big Five Software game. It also has very clever graphics and transitions between different screens. When you get a high score, each letter of the high score screen explodes individually on the screen. In my opinion, Defense Command is the most impressive of the Big Five games for the TRS‑80.","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gIxmbjAq_lM"},"134925":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Galaxy Invasion (1980)(Big-Five)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Five Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b97d2277-843b-4949-bfef-8d1d5108219a.JPG","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3319e2aa-0b02-4b54-a9b1-a7ed2c06500b.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1da4f1b6-094f-4757-8770-f8949fd646cf.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"56b17120-437f-4014-ac53-290851964a27.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c678aa59-45c1-40c8-9941-ccc6bcce73f0.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Galaxy Invasion","Overview":"Many people thought that Galaxy Invasion was based on Space Invaders (including a reviewer for 80 Microcomputing), but this was a common misconception. Galaxy Invasion was based on the arcade game Galaxian, which was released by Namco in 1979.\n\nGalaxy Invasion was the first Big Five Software game to feature sound and music. In addition to the tune that plays during the title screen, there are many different sounds during the transitions between screens and when shots are fired.\n\nThe game starts with your ship at the bottom of the screen and a formation of different kinds of aliens at the top. You move your ship from side to side and you can fire up (although only one shot at a time). The aliens periodically attack by swooping down and dropping bombs on you. You receive points for shooting an alien, and double points if you shoot it while it is attacking. What makes the game interesting is the distinctive behavior of the aliens. Each type of alien has a slightly different role and behavior. For instance, one type of alien acts as a bodyguard to the Flagship.\n\nGalaxy Invasion features the return of the Flagship, last seen in Super Nova. If you don’t destroy one of the Flagships on screen within a set time, then a “Flagship Attack Alert” starts. An continuing alert sound signals to you that a Flagship must be destroyed.\n\nIf the “Flagship Attack Alert” expires before you can destroy a Flagship, then all of the Flagships on screen will fire lightning bolts at you. Unlike the lightning bolts in Super Nova, these are always fatal.\n\nAfter you pass 200,000 points, the “Flagship Attack Alert” is on all the time that a Flagship is on screen. As your score increases, more Flagships fill the top row of the screen until they occupy it completely.\n\nGalaxy Invasion is one of my favorite TRS‑80 games. It takes full advantage of the limited resolution of the TRS‑80 screen and actually makes that work to its advantage. In my opinion, the combination of smooth gameplay and clever sounds makes it one of the best example of a TRS‑80 game ever written.","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6jj1C93rmvw"},"134927":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Invasion Force (26-1906)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Radio Shack","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c5dbfce8-aa9d-4845-bfe1-f70964f0c9d5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"06a9b169-1502-418a-954d-c6bd047a494d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a148ef29-84ae-406a-8b7f-3ef80196dafa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7321599c-9970-4daa-9700-5aaf4b366c2d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0e679040-2c5b-4e44-886b-d9c6fbb6eb3c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Invasion Force","Overview":"Protect the galaxy against the hated and feared Jovians.

Despite the name, Meteor Mission 2 is not a sequel to Bill Hogue‘s earlier Meteor Mission. Amusingly, the first Alpha Products advertisement to feature Meteor Mission 2 mistakenly used pictures from Meteor Mission instead.\n\nThe goal is to rescue astronauts who are stranded on the surface at the bottom of the screen. Your mission has two parts: the first is to pilot the spaceship and land it on one of the landing pads at the bottom of the screen. The second part is to carry the rescued astronaut to the space station at the top of the screen. To complicate matters, meteors move constantly through the playing field. You ship will be destroyed if you hit a meteor.\n\nUnlike Lunar Lander, there is no need to slow down the spaceship before it touches the landing pad. In fact the landing speed makes no difference at all. The only ways to crash are to hit a meteor, the sides, or the ground.\n\nAfter landing and rescuing an astronaut, you need to ascend to the Space Station. The lander climbs gradually, but you can increase the speed by using the fire button. The fire button also fires a shot, which allows you to destroy asteroids that are in your way. You can gain points by shooting the asteroids, but moving to try to intercept meteors increases the difficulty.\n\nOccasionally, an asteroid will start flashing. After flashing for a while, the asteroid will turn into a Flagship. The Flagship doesn’t shoot at you, but it does get in the way as it moves across the screen. It is worth many extra points, but mostly serves as a distraction.\n\nAfter a certain point in the game, meteor showers start appearing. These showers are very frustrating, because there often isn’t time to get out of their way before they hit you.\n\nAfter you rescue all of the astronauts, the round ends and you receive a bonus. The landing pads are rebuilt and the process starts again.","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8yW_lB6na1k"},"134929":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Robot Attack (1981)(Bill-Hogue)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Five Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3de92183-3593-4726-98ca-04b8176b55a5.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0728108b-dbb1-485f-9730-e03de661038f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8853013d-4a93-456d-abaa-1d491a1fe0e5.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a6d66745-c69f-4a96-9293-04ef9c2d40d7.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5d826247-4387-4588-b7e5-d3845c2820a2.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"14ac3059-6d5d-4914-8ee4-15073a29446f.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Robot Attack","Overview":"Robot Attack was based on the arcade game Berzerk, which was released by Stern Electronics in 1980. The game concept itself is older than that, and can be found in any number of BASIC games, such as Chase, Robots, and Daleks. Robot Attack was notable as the first talking game released by Big Five Software. The game supports the TRISSTICK and Alpha Joystick, but not the original STICK-80 (unless you perform a hardware modification to it). In my opinion, it makes the best use of the joystick of any TRS‑80 game.\n\nOne of the most distinguishing features of Robot Attack is the voice, which is that of Bill Hogue himself. The speech is especially remarkable when you consider that encoding voices for arcade games was incredibly expensive at that time; the voices in Berzerk are estimated to have cost tens of thousands of dollars. The disk version of Robot Attack has much longer sections of speech, including the impressive: “Great Score, Player 1. You have achieved the highest score so far. Enter your initials carefully so that we may save them permanently.”\n\nRobot Attack features an extended scrolling title sequence (think of Star Wars). This sequence leads into an impressive transition to the title screen.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you are in a room that is stocked with robots. The goal is to destroy as many robots as possible and exit the room. The faster you clear the room, the more bonus points you receive. The walls to the room are electrified and will destroy you if you touch them. The robots are also deadly to your touch. What makes it interesting is that the robots are also destroyed if they touch the walls. You receive points for each robot destroyed, even if it walked into a wall on its own.\n\nDifferent robots have different behaviors. Some stay in the same spot and others move towards the player. By observing their behaviors, you can often fool the robots into walking into a shot or the wall. You can sometimes clear a room without firing a single shot.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the robots don’t shoot at all. But once the score passes 1000 points, the robots do start shooting. This makes the game much more difficult. The robots are indiscriminate with their shots; they will shoot other robots if they get in the way. You can often use this to your advantage.\n\nAfter a certain amount of time has passed, the Flagship appears. Contrary to its behavior in previous Big Five Software games, the Flagship fires no shots and can’t be destroyed. Instead, it steadily moves towards you, moving through walls and destroying any robots in its path. This puts a definite time limit on each level; you have to flee the room or be destroyed. The Flagship follows your movements, which means that clever players can make the Flagship touch and destroy robots left in the room.\n\nIf you beat one of the high scores, then you can add your name to the scoreboard. The high scores are displayed graphically and they scroll like the title text. The disk version permanently saves these scores.","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=li-67gJBEXE"},"134930":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Scarfman (1981)(Cornsoft-Group)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Cornsoft Group","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"bab6136a-db0b-485c-8e62-682eac4722a9.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7810b3b4-6683-48a9-8921-363f9bd58e37.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"abe06f6c-ba0e-4582-9eeb-46fc0b06dca7.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"37bedf30-860d-4089-8198-3a86b3ff4559.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ebe9ec6b-5eaf-4ca7-84c6-caba907c5e96.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dffe43fd-3af0-423a-be46-8f68422b8877.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Scarfman","Overview":"Scarfman was based on the arcade game Pac-Man, which was released by Namco in 1980. It was written by Philip Oliver and distributed by the Cornsoft Group. The Cornsoft Group also released a version of Scarfman for the Color Computer.\n\nThe game starts with you (the “Scarfman”) at the bottom of the screen. Like Pac-Man, the goal of Scarfman is to eat all of the dots on the screen. You earn points for every dot eaten.\n\nFive monsters start out at the top of the screen, initially with their eyes up. When in the eyes up state, monsters move quickly and chase you. You lose a life if one touches the Scarfman.\n\nBut if you eat one of the pluses scattered through the screen, all of the monsters lower their eyes. When in the eyes down state, monsters move more slowly, run away from you, and are vulnerable to being caught. If you catch a monster, it returns to the top of the screen with its eyes up again. The eyes down state doesn’t last for long; all of the monsters revert to the eyes up state after only a short time. The monsters shimmer just before they revert, giving you a bit of warning.\n\nClearing a screen by eating all of the dots and pluses moves you to a new screen. The difficulty level becomes significantly greater with each new screen. The monsters become smarter and the amount of time it takes for them to revert to the eyes up state becomes shorter.\n\nThe Model III cassette version of Scarfman came with an extra instruction sheet listing the two BASIC commands needed to enable the Model III expansion bus. TRS‑80 joysticks, such as the TRISSTICK, used the expansion bus but it wasn’t automatically enabled by the cassette version of Scarfman. This wasn’t a problem for the disk version.\n\nScarfman is one of my favorite TRS‑80 games. It has a nice feel, with very fluid movement that works well with a joystick. It uses minimal, but appropriate sound effects. I think it is the best of the Pac-Man games for the TRS‑80.","Publisher":"The Cornsoft Group","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=goqHUsPFAk0"},"134931":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Stellar Escort (1982)(Jeff-Zin-Big-5)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Five Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"dec0e333-bb5e-4ba7-8163-15f36d0b653d.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f282930-405f-4a6a-9775-2c22a73ba917.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ea735be9-96d5-443a-9485-372fa0317c15.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"79b9c41d-1e03-4e54-b8c5-2991a6db19bc.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9afa42f2-c235-471a-adf3-bf6e3b277dd6.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ef6660b3-87a3-47a2-8106-aef2603a8412.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Stellar Escort","Overview":"Stellar Escort was written by Jeff Zinn, and it was the first game distributed by Big Five Software that wasn’t written by Bill Hogue.

They were sold directly through Big Five and were resold by many other companies.\n\nRadio Shack also sold Big Five games in two collections compiled by Cogito Software. Games Pack Two and Games Pack Three first appeared in the 1984 Radio Shack catalog and contained four Big Five games: Defense Command, Stellar Escort, Cosmic Fighter and Meteor Mission 2.\n\nThe names Big Five Software and Bill Hogue were legendary in the field of TRS‑80 games. Bill Hogue and Jeff Konyu created Big Five Software in order to market their TRS‑80 games.

It was the first big success for Bill Hogue and Big Five Software.\n\nSuper Nova was originally available only on cassette tape. It required a Model I with 16K and Level I or Level II BASIC. Later, Big Five sold a disk version which saved high scores and required a 32K Model 1. They also sold both cassette and disk versions for the Model III.\n\nRather than the arrow keys, Super Nova uses the R, T, O, and P keys to control the player, and the SPACEBAR to activate hyperspace. This might sound awkward, but it is actually quite easy to use and similar to the five keys used by the arcade Asteroids. Super Nova was so popular that other TRS‑80 games supported these keys as well. Later versions of Super Nova supported a joystick, but I think that the keyboard control works better for this game.\n\nAt the start of Super Nova, you control a spaceship at the center of the screen. Large, slow moving meteors surround you and will destroy your ship if they hit you. You can move and shoot in all directions and you can fire multiple shots at once. If you shoot a large meteor, it will break into a smaller meteor. There are three sizes of meteors, each with a different point value. Smaller meteors tend to move faster than the larger ones. After you destroy all of the meteors on the screen, a new set of large meteors appear and the process repeats.\n\nTo complicate matters, alien ships appear after the screen is mostly cleared of meteors. These ships are worth more points than the meteors, but they shoot back at you. Notice the names of two of the types of alien ships: BH (Bill Hogue) and JLK (Jeff L. Konyu).\n\nThe smaller screen size of Super Nova compared to Asteroids means different strategies apply. My favorite technique is to destroy all but three or four of the small meteors that are slower than the rest. I then wait and destroy the aliens as they appear, being careful not to destroy the small meteors in the crossfire. Not going through the cycle of a new set of large meteors makes it easier to build up the your score faster. Of course, missed shots and shots by the aliens will eventually destroy the rest of the meteors.\n\nSuper Nova features the first appearance of the Flagship, an alien ship which became an iconic figure in the Big Five games. In Super Nova, it starts appearing after the score passes 10,000 points. Unlike the other aliens, the Flagship fires lightning bolts at the player instead of shots. These bolts are impossible to dodge, and the Flagship tends to destroy the player after three of four bolts. Sometimes it just takes one bolt. The Flagship (usually along with the lightning bolts) appeared in all subsequent TRS‑80 games written by Bill Hogue.","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p3s4PJ9dsYI"},"134933":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Weerd (1982)(Big-5-Software)","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Five Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5c2b7114-36b5-47f7-a748-857951185f0e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b8d13203-f3de-4dda-b4eb-547295625e2d.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8ff8fe02-050a-4b2f-9f55-86468c5c2b2d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"07023542-c59e-4cdf-9afb-698da4798934.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b6eff38a-de7b-4227-8d48-787282bc102e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Weerd","Overview":"Weerd was written by Arthur Gleckler and released in 1982. It was the final TRS‑80 game released by Big Five, and only the second one not written by Bill Hogue. Weerd was released near the very end of the TRS‑80 game market.\n\nThe goal in Weerd is to destroy the attacking aliens. The controls are pretty standard: LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW to move and SPACEBAR to fire. But there are two additional controls: S to activate shields and SHIFT to move quickly. The shields are three barriers that stop shots from hitting you, but also stop you from shooting through them. Most aliens won’t pass through the shields, while others move through without any problems.\n\nWeerd supports a joystick.

This success encouraged the authors to seek financial income by selling the program directly to customers. Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte magazine selling for $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. \n\nWhen magnetic media publishing became widely available, a US Navy petty officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering the graphics, input, and housekeeping routines but leaving the Spracklen's chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, who were both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software.","Publisher":"Hayden Book Company, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1978},"165823":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Leo Christopherson","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"78a97055-a7ed-479a-bbc0-6f06de38fbda.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1f6c7eb3-d9a6-4810-96c4-21bedda2ab76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"4fb99c68-f5fc-4fdb-b400-2a1b767724f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"686f4669-7747-4963-b91c-e0bdb28bdcb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"df27b73e-8aaa-4fdb-a39e-1931137cd0c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Android Nim","Overview":"Android Nim is a representation of the mathematical game Nim.

KING).\n\nAt its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace. However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.\n\nVarying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves. Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies. If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!\n\nNearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death. All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.","Publisher":"TRS-80 Software Exchange","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1978},"194649":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Role-Playing","Name":"TelenGard","Overview":"Telengard is an earlier example of a \"dungeon crawler\" role-playing game--albeit with a top-down view- with either real time movement (DOS version) or turn-based movement and turn based combat.

The vast Telengard dungeon consists of 50 levels down and 200 by 200 rooms each level. Experience is awarded not only for defeating enemies, but also for finding treasure. When the player character gains a level, their attributes increase, and they gain the ability to cast higher-leveled spells.\n\nTreasure chests appear randomly in the dungeon. There are also specific features such as altars, thrones, fountains, etc. that the adventurer can discover which may have various effects on the character, whether being either positive or negative.
