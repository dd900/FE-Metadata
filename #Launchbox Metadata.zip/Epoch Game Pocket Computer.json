As in Pengo, the blocks slide when pushed until they reach a wall or another block. The maze is also littered with plain black blocks, which can be used both to crush the two nasties roaming the maze (though they respawn after a few seconds) and to stop the alphabetic blocks at a desired position. To complicate things, there are rotating ramps near each corner. If a block slides into the ramp, it is deflected 90 degrees, which can be used both to reach otherwise unreachable nasties or to get the alphablocks in the right position without too many pushes. Blocks can, and must often, be destroyed to make way for the player sprite and other blocks.\n\nOnce an alphablock reaches its corner, a fruit machine marked with the letters of the four corners is started on the top of the screen, granting you up to 1000 points if the letter you've cleared turns up.","Publisher":"Epoch","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"125666":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Epoch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"82344cc1-152f-42c0-af3b-c32c968ba5f3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a3c86e3-76dd-44dc-be22-f9a74c2f8e54.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d9dada4-ff71-432b-86f1-64fa0871861a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"48c4787c-85c3-40ff-ba85-6c1d556515d1.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"ad043a86-1b62-4cdd-8883-3a515e7f82f7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cb5952af-3cca-47c7-a8c8-a96575e2da72.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4df8611b-3164-49b7-91e0-688f12c5a262.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f06588b6-c705-45bd-8c99-a6d55453c41e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b369fe63-d7c6-43bc-9b04-4ff95c78b919.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Reversi","Overview":"Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board.

Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.\n\nThe object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.","Publisher":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"125691":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"5d0fa9bf-f005-4dfe-a172-7fabd162d550.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8940a9b-ee0e-456e-b9b0-f5ae3c50f7f1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ca1419cf-0df1-4897-8f74-0f5c52153b93.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"d619fff9-a07e-476a-9db7-9e311436474a.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"69f0c955-183f-4982-8b52-cdd5cd514788.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eda5cecb-e11f-40aa-bcc9-a2644509bd34.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1568a922-d5f9-410d-8c4f-8edbc843fbc4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ee33eb6a-0645-486c-af3c-0a68623beec8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"78c7a06d-d9b8-4721-929f-80e02eff2fd3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mahjongg","Publisher":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"143970":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"倉庫番","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Sokoban","Region":"The Netherlands"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Thinking Rabbit","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"12376d4d-6ffa-4a84-aca0-038d37d932bf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2db8d93a-1370-43db-8818-b8b488973e23.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b709ee81-b77a-41e9-b7c6-380ef9d342e4.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"8afa1806-2630-4fd4-8dd1-7a36419ef2f6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"cbc6fe7b-56fd-42e9-82ca-d3b02879459d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a4a8379f-26d3-4b0a-9bab-7b3615dcae29.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1ed0275f-23e1-47ac-ac44-d98ab57f8512.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c1810a9d-f4aa-4059-956b-5f9b88b1ecd5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b3781005-9308-4c08-9f86-45d03efcddc6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Soko-Ban","Overview":"Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years.

Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved!
