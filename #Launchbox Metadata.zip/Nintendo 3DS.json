The object of the game is simple; find two matching tiles that are not blocked by other tiles on either side (up and down is not an option), and slowly whittle away at the layout till all of the tiles have been removed. While simple in practice, the possibilities are endless.\n\nThe game has two sets of rules, Rivers and Classic. In Rivers, tiles must be on the same layer, and the line connecting them may not change direction more than twice. In Classic, tiles must not be covered by other tiles, and must be free to their left or right side.\n\nThe game has two modes: Free Play and Adventure mode which has 200 combinations of the available options you must solve completely before moving forward. There is no basic \"save\" feature, but rather you create a profile, and if you turn off the 3DS it will start you at the next level to be completed when you return to Adventure mode.\n\nThe layout is viewed on the touch screen and the 3D screen. You chose your matching tiles (or the option to rewind or fast forward your moves) on the touch screen, and a 3D representation of the layout is seen on the upper screen.\n\nThe layouts are represented in 3D and with 50 different types, along with six different animated 3D backgrounds called \"Scenes\", as well as six different touch screen backgrounds, and six different tile sets which includes sea creatures, zombies, fantasy characters and traditional playing cards. Like many puzzle games with multiple options, you have to unlock the additional layouts, scenes, backgrounds and tile sets, which is done through Adventure mode.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Joindots","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143479,"FileName":"59362ec3-33e1-4865-9030-e889bd768ea1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":143479,"FileName":"aefead9e-f03c-40fc-aa1b-2cbd9a516b79.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":143479,"FileName":"d13524fe-e697-49ea-bcca-3e2304c6058f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93914,"Name":"3D Out Run","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"3D third-person racing game.

Like the original, players run through different worlds called \"zones\", which each have their own specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress. The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called \"Badniks\". This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg. Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world.\n\nSonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels. As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life. However, the rings also act as protection; if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible. If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage. In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint. Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.\n\nNew to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails. Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.

The game board is divided with grades one through five listed with two questions a piece, which is randomized after each game. The player can also choose which grade and subject to answer at any time.\n\nAt the beginning of the game they choose one from five different classmates (Amanda, Cynthia, Joseph, Edward, and Logan), each with their own subject specialties and changes a student after two questions. They can use these classmates to either \"copy\" (which lets the player use the answer of their classmate) and \"peek\" (which lets the player take a look at their classmates answer and help them decide). There is also a \"save\" cheat that saves the player in case both they and their classmate both get a question wrong. Also, a player can \"drop out\" at anytime and end the game with the money they have won.\n\nThe first nine questions are given to the player in the form of multiple choice, however the final $1,000,000 question requires the player to manual spell out the answer. Additionally, a player can not use a \"cheat\" or \"drop out\", once they choose to answer the question, they must answer it. While the game's rules are identical to those of the TV show, one main difference is that their is no time limit, giving the player an ample opportunity to \"cheat\" in their own way.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2015-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143563,"FileName":"23e5289f-0f4e-4403-ab69-5df56082f38f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143563,"FileName":"182e6aa3-af7a-4de9-be02-7f2fdf2f774d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143563,"FileName":"d488aa45-5b2e-465a-8b2c-444ee11001b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143565,"Name":"A-Ressha de Ikou 3D NEO","ReleaseYear":"2016","Overview":"An updated and expanded version of \"A-Ressha de Ikou 3D NEO\".

You'll be given a stationary picture of a room with three or four objects to find in it. When you find these objects you will use them to uncover the pages of the Azada book in order to move to the next puzzle. For example you will need a pipe segment which you'll need to attach to a pipe you uncover while opening a cupboard and then when the pipe drains a number combination will fall out which you'll enter into a lock-keypad and so on and so forth.\n\nThere are over forty different puzzles and puzzles make re-appearances as you play along the game and will get more challenging as you encounter them further along. For example the aforementioned Towers of Hanoi will gradually go from four discs to transfer over to seven discs. There are five master-level puzzle challenges to move through which are actually the pages of the Azada book where the forty+ puzzles are contained.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Big Fish Games","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146726,"FileName":"150b8153-a55e-485c-92b2-a79eea0ce867.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":146726,"FileName":"6f534d5f-53c5-482d-ae0b-4e8034137269.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":146726,"FileName":"caccc0f6-7cdd-4580-a3af-23b55b7c98a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":146726,"FileName":"7966d423-cd4f-46aa-aee4-0ab3e791e5ea.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153564,"Name":"Azito 3D","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-11-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153564,"FileName":"438b0f6b-c63d-49c5-8062-d0ee5e059570.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21901,"Name":"Azure Striker Gunvolt","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Azure Striker GUNVOLT is a 2D side-scrolling action game.

The game has a mission mode, which is made of different missions accessed when the required clearance level has been reached. Clearing missions will award the points necessary to unlock higher clearance levels.\n\nThe races play in a manner similar to Mario Kart games: while racing, the player can use a number of maneuvers such as drifting, jumping, driving backwards or on two wheel, as well as use a turbo using energy, or the 'In the Zone' turbo, which will be in effect as long as there is energy remaining. Some tracks allows the use of weapons (spy gadgets) to take down competitors. Such weapons include missiles, machine guns, and oil patches.\n\nThe game modes, which also make up the mission mode's levels, include a regular race mode, a battle race mode that allow the use of spy gadgets, the hunter mode in which the goal is to eliminate waves of enemies, the attack mode in which a fleeing foe must be eliminated before time runs out, a survival mode in which batteries must be collected in order to avoid the game-ending satellite beam, a multiplayer battle arena mode in which the player who scores the most hits wins, and the disruptor mode, a multiplayer base-defense game.\n\nThe game includes awards such as badges and new characters to unlock.

This makes it easier to distinguish elements in busy environments, but optionally it can be scaled back to the original 4:3 resolution.\n\nContentwise there are a few small tweaks. The in-game map is no longer visible at the bottom of the screen all the time, encouraging the player not to rely on it too much. It is also possible to customize the controls, flipping jump and shoot buttons for instance. The game incorporates the additional content of the WiiWare and + version with the modes Boss Rush, Curly Story, and Sanctuary Time Attack (WiiWare and Cave Story+ versions) and the new unlockable Wind Fortress area with the new enemies and bosses, and the Nemesis Challenge (Cave Story+). It includes the reindeer and vampire sprite swaps from the WiiWare version, but not the holiday themed content from Cave Story+.

A typical level is filled with objects with different colours. The pulsating ones can be dragged into another one to combine them, filling all the available background with that colour. By doing that with multiple objects the entire area can be cleared. There is a catch however as the final colour needs to be the one of the area's border, already shown at the start of the game. That way, the challenge is focused on combining the colours in the correct order.\n\nLater levels add additional game elements. Dotted shapes can be tapped to toggle a shield, preventing them from being affected by a colour fill. There are also black shapes. When an object is dragged into a black one, it disappears, without spreading its colour. As the objects can be flung with a swipe next to dragging them, the player also has to watch out not to bump into a black objects accidentally. Certain levels have spikes that are used to make a shape disappear. Unlike a black object, a single spike can be used multiple times.\n\nThe mobile game is free-to-play with additional levels as in-app purchases. The complete game offers five large themes, split up into multiple chapters and levels unlocked gradually. Each theme has slight changes to the visuals or the gameplay. Next to Classic, Seasons introduces levels with seasonal colours. The Reflection levels have a mirror design where the player's action are mirrored with another object on the other side of the screen. The two other themes are Serenity and Nature. There are 460 levels in total. For the mobile version not all of them were available at the original launch (only Classic and Nature), but released in packs afterwards (Serenity, Reflection and Season respectively).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2014-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":148896,"FileName":"96f07995-61eb-4ec1-9de7-1b334489d6f9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":148896,"FileName":"e31f8026-4c80-441a-bfe2-0780beae79cb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":148896,"FileName":"7b6e3a3c-4a7b-40bd-ab1d-535ed319d3bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":148897,"Name":"Color Zen Kids","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"For your own Zen masters in training, Color Zen Kids is a fun new twist on the critically acclaimed puzzle game.

During the day, the player-controlled Dillon can explore the local area to look for resources to sell and use the money to build up the village's defences, as well as run errands for the villagers. During the night, the rock monsters arrive to attack the village, so to support the defences he's built up, Dillon will fight them by rolling into a ball and charging at them. The player can roll Dillon into a ball using the touch screen and control his direction while rolling using the circle pad. Upon impact, they can either hold for a grinding attack or tap to start a combo.\n\nOnce Dillon has successfully held the rock monsters back for three days, he is free to move on to another village.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Vanpool","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20833,"FileName":"cbedd3d1-1b42-46dc-81c0-032ff97857ca.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":20833,"FileName":"9d8c5dce-43fb-48a2-a978-7eecd5c2cb87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20833,"FileName":"e5556fc3-768b-4032-9c9d-7af95129ea6c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20833,"FileName":"3c510365-d2ec-4050-a8bf-4849d9a3f981.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20833,"FileName":"d5bf355a-75c1-4daa-82f0-448954b5537c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":20833,"FileName":"3d73f34d-3507-46bf-aa8d-16f513f25fdc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21085,"Name":"Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dillon, an armadillo, is a ranger charged with protecting villages from nightly invasions of walking rock monsters called Grocks.

It tells the story of the teenager Violetta who returns with her father Germán from Europe to her hometown Buenos Aires in Argentine. Violetta has musical talent and episodes focus a lot on Latin and pop music as she enrols in Studio 21 to become a star. While there are some differences between the versions for the three platforms, the basic concept is identical.\n\nPlayers get to play three types of rhythm games with songs from the show as the soundtrack in a career mode or through quick play sessions. One of the games is played on a staff where the player moves a microphone icon using the wiimote or the stylus to catch notes, stars and full hearts, while avoiding broken hearts. In the Wii version full motion video from the show is running in the background while the DS version has 3D animated scenes. A score is kept and the lyrics to the song are shown so players can sing along.\n\nIn another game notes fall from the sky and the player needs to catch them along with butterflies, while avoiding hearts, before they reach the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe third game is a trivia game where the title of a song or the next line in the lyrics needs to be guessed based on an excerpt and with a timer counting down. A score is calculated based on the number of correct guesses, streaks and the remaining time.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145031,"FileName":"1cfc3735-66d8-42d3-99c2-25a70506e7d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145031,"FileName":"d144292a-0dc1-4135-8006-c898c80cbe41.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145031,"FileName":"fe9ee838-ddb0-47cd-994f-b07c2f561bb9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":145031,"FileName":"b6720ed8-131d-4a6d-95ae-418c00151048.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":13244,"Name":"Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Enter 19th century Europe and the world of Doctor Jean-Pierre Lautrec.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":148930,"FileName":"6fcdcd32-3216-4329-918c-020d9becb931.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":148930,"FileName":"f9db7ab6-8364-4492-b931-2ca85ced98da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":148930,"FileName":"307e8b2a-868d-41d8-8c1d-f724be24ba3a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":148930,"AlternateName":"Donkey Kong: Original Edition","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":17109,"Name":"Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Controlled by a group of evil Tikis, the animals in Donkey Kong Island have raided Donkey Kong's Banana Hoard and stolen his stash of bananas - and he understandably wants them back.

The player assembles a deck of five cards for battles. As the player uses the touch stylus to create a card formation on the bottom screen, the battle unfolds on the top screen. Actions, such as the Charge Impact, are done so that the player can intuitively do them with their hands on the portable device.\n\nThe game includes a scouter function, which uses the 3DS' camera to take a picture of someone's face in order to check their power. This allows the player to earn Zeni and other items. Scan someone with a high power level and Great Ape Vegeta will appear as a boss fight, and tag up with friends to take him on. Scanning special QR codes allows the player to fight special bosses, such as Beerus or Super Saiyan God Goku from the 2013 movie Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods.\n\nIn the story mode, the player moves around what is called the Ultimate Map and experiences the story from the Saiyan Saga up through Dragon Ball GT, with the most famous scenes from the series recreated for the game. By completing missions, more cards are obtained in the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjPqg_uF5WY","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting; Role-Playing","Developer":"Dimps","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2013-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"d8652eb7-b5e2-42f1-8f6a-b657ec0fe224.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"4e888ade-9a16-47a8-86ca-3d4d3a6c0511.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"1abfffae-7b70-4126-acd6-0a51691047aa.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"51aa4b54-4907-4d8d-8d00-6e2b1d830aaf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"e4c59227-728c-4d07-8850-b92c5d3345ed.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"db27a47f-cdbd-4866-8346-c2e2ae3b28a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"c8a81568-57ba-4ade-8ce0-695242fad2cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"fc73101b-2ab6-4809-adbb-9a97871719f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"7f4bda6f-05a5-4439-9c3d-aa8e54253633.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"500bc225-ef5b-4f96-9844-bbe27be2f50c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123987,"FileName":"01084510-5aec-4147-a51f-003021215ca1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123988,"Name":"Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultimate Mission 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultimate Mission 2 is a card-based fighting game that is a portable-port of the arcade game Dragon Ball Heroes, and the sequel to Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultimate Mission.

Always randomized with various levels and paths, the dungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible loot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bOSI9rDkE0","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Atlus","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"b8d5f586-c18a-4544-b56f-a29730c449f2.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"c8d66e11-da55-4a95-b0d9-33c5f4c28607.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"f5f9a3bc-ff0f-4c2f-921e-7feb31de7c22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"5473dab5-0b7b-4151-ac9d-d34699192e40.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"f72566f7-c02b-48e4-8b70-5b0ef97bdc01.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"bcd50b2d-f40b-4bef-bc78-e2a2042007e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"ab0b0644-13ac-4162-bb16-4e7abeab997a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":28909,"FileName":"19fa2336-7798-42b6-b2cc-e2682689f3b2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":28909,"AlternateName":"Sekaiju to Fushigi no Dungeon","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":154920,"Name":"Etrian Mystery Dungeon 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154920,"FileName":"d03bb09c-1a70-470f-b97c-11e80048da3a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":154920,"AlternateName":"Sekaiju to Fushigi no Dungeon 2","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":29433,"Name":"Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The next entry of the Etrian Odyssey Untold series is essentially two games in one - the first, a Nintendo 3DS update to Etrian Odyssey 2: Heroes of Laggard (released on Nintendo DS) with new dungeon layouts, new graphics, and system improvements from the recent Etrian Odyssey Untold.

Then, there are the elemental and class cards. These are much stronger attacks and will take much larger chunks of health of enemies. Class Cards are even stronger and are useful in finishing a damaged foe. There are 100 different cards in total but, the player can only take 10 cards into a battle and most of them are single-use in battle with a couple having multiple uses. Opponents, on the other hand, tend to have infinitely replenishing elements so, players have to use their cards carefully.\n\nThe main game's story has the player have to find the 7 Class Cards around the city in 7 nights but, they can go to up to 3 locations in a night. There are 7 locations in total and the next Class Card's location is indicated on the map. Going to other locations will trigger either dialogue, battle with other characters or 3 random elemental cards. To get a Class Card, the player has to go to that location and fight the Class.\n\nThere are four characters, all based on characters from the series. They generally play the same. They are the following:\n\nIllyasviel von Einzbern (Only one unlocked at the start)\nMiyu Edelfelt\nRin Tohsaka\nLuviagelita Edelfelt\nIn addition to single player, there is a local multiplayer option where up to 4 players can play as the 4 characters and fight it out using the rules from the single player.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153684,"FileName":"235b1803-15ce-405a-9875-c1912b3ee63a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145085,"Name":"FIFA 12","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This version of FIFA 12 is designed for touch based mobile devices. In addition to single matches it features four basic game modes: leagues, cups, practice arena and penalty shoot-out. There are thirty leagues and twenty one cups to compete in. In both leagues and cups the player can either choose to play the matches himself or to simulate them. Some team management options exist. The player can pick a formation and a starting eleven as well as kick takers and team styles. Team styles include for example playing with counter attacks, zonal marking and attacking full backs. The iOS version of the game also features a manager career mode that is not available in the Android version. In addition to these game modes there are also daily challenges where the player joins a match at a certain stage and has to succeed with a task, for example scoring with a free kick.\n\nThe game is entirely played with touch controls. A d-pad is used for moving the players around and three context sensitive buttons are used for actions. In offence these are sprint, pass and shoot while in defence they are slide, switch and sprint tackle. For simple manoeuvres the player simply taps the buttons, but for more complex actions it's possible to make swipes from the buttons. For example to make a finesse shot, the player presses the pass button and then makes an upwards swipe. Other actions that can be performed by making swipes include chips, crosses and through balls. In addition to the buttons there are some other ways to do actions. A skill move can be done by double tapping the screen, while forward runs for players without the ball can be done by making swiping motions along the pitch. It is also possible to make passes by tapping the player that should get the ball.\n\nThe iPad version of the game features an option to use one or two iPhones as controllers through a bluetooth connection. For this to work the player has to download a separate app for the iPhone.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145085,"FileName":"0034bddd-c7c3-4d0f-ad9d-8a17a921877a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145085,"FileName":"52ee3631-fbbe-4761-88e1-65a7f1c05477.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145085,"FileName":"b3e66b98-f581-45a0-8082-430aef4d8563.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145085,"FileName":"e95ae4bc-c4c0-40ce-8274-333d7740ffce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145085,"FileName":"8099b1be-74ae-44de-8374-497e11707b86.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":145085,"AlternateName":"FIFA Soccer 12","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":145086,"Name":"FIFA 13","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"FIFA 13 (also known as FIFA Soccer 13 in North America) is the 2012 edition of Electronic Arts' association football FIFA video game series and was developed by EA Canada.

Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. \"When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come...\" And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins.\n\nFinal Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names.\n\nIn the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price.\n\nSpells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons & Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.\n\nThis is the Japanese-only remastered Nintendo 3DS version from Nintendo eShop.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVKECNwdZbA","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Square Enix Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":177198,"FileName":"c45d67a9-3322-4e17-b1ea-331106cbc7e1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177198,"FileName":"46080c39-6076-4687-8d98-96e4bd700a27.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177198,"FileName":"10e04faf-a353-4807-8e4e-aa9f2e93e5b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24781,"Name":"Final Fantasy: Explorers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Final Fantasy Explorers (ファイナルファンタジー エクスプローラーズ Fainaru Fantajī Ekusupurōrāzu?) is an action role-playing video game for the Nintendo 3DS.

The player takes on the role of Prince Ephraim and his sister Princess Erika, two of the few survivors of Grado's attack, following their different paths through the story.\n\nGameplay in Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is similar to its predecessors or the Advance Wars games. The player controls several different units in tactical turn-based battles.\n\nThere are many different classes ranging from knights, thieves and archers to paladins, wyvern riders, great knights and more. As in RPGs, units receive experience points for their actions and may choose to upgrade to a different class once they reach a high enough level.\n\nA key element in Fire Emblem's gameplay are the three different types of weapons and magic. One type of weapon or magic is always strong against one, and weak against another type.\n\nDuring battles, it is also possible to visit stores to buy equipment, or houses to gain hints.\n\nSometimes neutral units will also participate in battle. They can be convinced to join the player's army if the right person talks to them.\n\nUnlike most similar games, when a unit dies in battle it is impossible to revive it.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":148949,"FileName":"a50c2872-dcef-4788-b289-93e5d52d74d7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145034,"Name":"Fireman Sam: To The Rescue","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fireman Sam and friends are back to save the day in a brand new adventure!

To raise the money necessary to buy expensive equipment and decorations, she dives to collect lost valuables scattered on underwater wrecks.\n\nFishdom H2O: Hidden Odyssey is a hidden object and the sequel to a previous tile matching title. As the biologist, the player has to buy new fish, plants and other items to customize an aquarium, shown as the main game screen. The equipment available to purchase is organized on three tabs at the bottom, for types of fish, decoration and comfort. The shop items can be bought and placed anywhere on the aquarium with the mouse. Each new addition increases one of three meters at the top right, measuring the quality of the fish, beauty and comfort. The goal is to completely fill them to earn a star and unlock the next aquarium.\n\nThe money required for the shopping is acquired in the hidden object sections. After clicking the dive button, Jennifer swims to a shipwreck, where every item collected is converted in some cash. These locations are random separate screens where the player must find several objects. Most of the time, the goal is to find and click on all the items from a list at the bottom of the screen, within a time limit. The time restriction can be turned off in the options menu. Some variations of gameplay occur: in Collectables, the objective is to find repeated instances of objects of the same type; in Gold Rush, the goal is to collect all the objects made of gold as fast as possible, before time runs out; in Quick Eye, the player has to find one of three items listed at the bottom, on ten turns, with some seconds added to the timer after each object is found.\n\nThe hint button is a jar filled with seahorses at the bottom-right. Clicking on it releases one of the creatures, that swims towards one of the required objects.

The game omits most of the rules of the traditional sport and instead offers a far more simplified take on it. The gameplay works similarly to other mobile sports games such as the Flick Kick series. The player views the action from a first-person perspective and hits the ball by doing swiping motions towards it on the touchscreen. The longer the swipe, the harder the hit gets. Once the ball is in the air the player can do curves and spins by swiping in the direction he wants it to go. The biggest difference from real golf is the scoring system. In Flick Golf the hole is surrounded by a target circle split in four zones. Hitting the zone closest to it gives the high points while the outer zone gives less. Missing the circle gives no points. Of course hitting the hole gives the most points. In addition to this the player can earn bonus points by doing extra skilled shots, for example with spins and curves.\n\nThe game has three modes: quickshot, world tour and quickshot pro. In the quickshot mode the game is timed and the player has eighty seconds to get as large score as possible. Good shots lead to a time increase. In the world tour mode the player only has nine shots to reach the target score. Quickshot pro is just like the regular quickshot mode but harder with harsher weather conditions, less time and larger score targets.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":148946,"FileName":"3fb30fd2-bd44-45b9-a2ec-4d0b116b2252.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":148946,"FileName":"e0fc6010-db1d-4fc6-bc2e-b179c3be00a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":148946,"FileName":"4c0e6835-3478-4b28-b2a0-44ec84bbff25.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":148947,"Name":"Flipnote Studio 3D","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Flipnote Studio 3D is a free drawing application that allows you to create your very own animated masterpieces.

Each of the featured games is a brand new \"faux-retro\" game made to look like an old 8- or 16-bit video game, from a wide variety of genres including maze games, platformers, shooters, and even a full-fledged RPG. There are also a number of side games including Game & Watch-style LCD games, marble labyrinth games, and even the 10-yen medal games commonly featured on the show's arcade trip segments, for a total of over 15 games.\n\nIn addition to the story mode, there is also a free mode where any unlocked game can be freely played, an ad-hod multiplayer mode for the games that support it, and a dictionary mode where famous quotes and terms from the TV show are explained.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"G.rev Ltd.","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"456983fe-035b-4cc6-ba13-07199fa5c1e9.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"7f5fc7d6-e783-4668-93a6-44dbf89a8ad4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"d20a6759-23f9-4aef-a002-a3762675fb93.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"d9ff1455-e68f-49b5-92c9-e4d1df0bcd71.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"e19638fd-ffa0-44b5-9212-3cbe7ca82831.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"7671b2a2-e87b-42df-80e7-8827bf23af2d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"b775f3cc-a517-4c93-afe8-f621a7200b69.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"9f552ef4-9bad-4c97-b40e-8ee0bf99534e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"80182fc8-6312-4a92-8115-68679f4eec5e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123348,"FileName":"e99d203e-0d82-4285-98bf-7f9a8214edc4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":123348,"AlternateName":"Game Center CX: 3-chōme no Arino","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":145037,"Name":"Games Festival 1","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145037,"FileName":"2f16b25a-0982-4e60-854d-933618c2fe0b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145037,"FileName":"34d997bf-5e6e-4afd-9920-e21cc4bb8fef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145037,"FileName":"a0bc3d8d-1049-47f4-ba50-f9746052863f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145038,"Name":"Games Festival 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Games Festival is back and better than ever!\n\nIncredible and fun attractions for young and old, bowling, skeet shooting, games of skill and the famous Whack-a-Mole!\n\nPlay on your own or with your friends – the only thing missing is candyfloss!","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145038,"FileName":"9f78e4ff-8a38-4ded-b995-8b1423805bb5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145038,"FileName":"6a4a958a-e9bb-4279-b864-1eb24c2c2a4d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145038,"FileName":"f93b7439-6e88-45a2-be7e-f9ce65e11a79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145039,"Name":"Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Plant the Seeds of Friendship!\nMama is back in her gardening gloves planting the seeds of friendship!

The object of each level is to demolish three radar beacons, then proceed to the chopper which will pick you up and carry you off to the next one.\n\nYour soldiers can run, jump, shoot as well as lean against low edges to fire from the safety of cover. Killed enemies drop various weapons, ammo, health items or gold. Weapons include flamethrowers, bouncing grenades, dual pistols that fire in two directions, jetpacks, high-power lasers and an egg-launching chicken gun. You can also ride in Black Duck Army tanks. Throughout the levels you will encounter buildings which you can enter, containing either storerooms with items, an NPC or shops where you can buy power-ups such a time-slowing energy drinks, continues or entrance to special bonus levels for your gold.\n\nInitially two playable characters are available, but more are unlocked throughout the game as they are rescued. While different characters play identically they serve as checkpoints, where selecting a character other than the two initially available with will start you on the level where they were unlocked.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":149657,"FileName":"5f83fc31-a7ab-4c79-a669-ccb6cc391258.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":149657,"FileName":"e7957f11-fb04-4559-8139-b988162d4c06.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":149657,"FileName":"c2a28ae1-229d-40a5-ac02-6d3dcce77f5c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":148957,"Name":"Gunslugs II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gunslugs II, the sequel to Gunslugs, is a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer where a team of commandos have to take on the evil Black Duck Army.

Also, by talking to Nelly in the clubroom, players can recruit people from the various teams they have beaten in the main story. There are nearly 1000 playable characters to collect, each with their own unique design, stats and abilities, but only 100 can be contained in a player's party at once.\n\nThe other part of the game is the football matches themselves. Players control their team with the stylus, moving players and passing between teammates. Running into an opponent initiates a command duel, where the player can do things like dodge an opponent's attempt at a tackle, slide-tackle to take the ball away, or attempt to score a goal. The result of any of their players' actions in a duel are determined by their form, which is decided by their stats (Kick, Body, Control, Guard, Speed, Stamina, and Guts), the player's element (either Wood, Air, Earth or Fire, which work in a 'rock-paper-scissors'-like fashion), and the total number of players participating in an action.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Level-5","Publisher":"Level-5, Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"d1386124-42d5-4778-adf6-5eb7e84ac040.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"be9087e6-eb99-4d23-b1cc-0423b73e1f44.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"fc48f0a7-9569-4648-84fa-c44475bb92bc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"69d181d2-8951-405c-87ec-0ad2e8a42954.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"0dcc0c9d-9bea-423f-a598-07d7ef7c912f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"db4ac84b-355b-4db8-a5f1-0ec741311c40.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"f2aec31f-5070-45e6-b105-744192b6bbd8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"859f3288-8bcd-4c05-9459-4aed7c6e1c88.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21214,"FileName":"fbf29dee-a1bf-4911-8ee9-d2dc54f580f1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154622,"Name":"Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3!!

He has dreams of competing in the Football Frontier, but with an unenthusiastic Soccer club and the looming threat of the club being closed due to inactivity, his chances are looking dim. That is, until he plays a match against the intimidating Teikoku Gakuen, a match which changes the Raimon Soccer Club forever.\n\nAfterwards, following the events of Inazuma Eleven 1, Endou and his team return to Raimon to find their school in ruins. In the wake of this destruction is the mysterious Aliea Gakuen, a supposedly extraterrestrial force spreading chaos and destruction throughout schools across Japan with the aim to make humans submit to their will. With a new coach in toe, Endou and the Inazuma Caravan head out in search of Japan's strongest players in hopes of creating the world's strongest team to take down the alien menace.\n\nAnd in the conclusion to Endou's legendary story, the Football Frontier International is coming up, and Coach Hibiki calls various soccer players to the Raimon grounds. After testing the players, Inazuma Japan is born, the team representing Japan. After conquering the Asian preliminaries, the tournament begins, but it seems that not all is right. What are the dark secrets of the FFI association?

Emma needs to visit all locations on the map screen. In each location you are given a list of objects to find. When each item is found it will disappear from the list. When every item is found the level will be completed. Three gold coins that are collected in a location provide a hint as to where an item can be found. A timer displayed shows the amount of time you have in order to complete a chapter. Bonus points are awarded for completing a location quickly. Certain activities have to be completed in each area before progress can be made such as finding a jewel board shard that allows you to play a jewel board in typical Jewel Quest fashion, solving a puzzle and using an item in your inventory to fix or manipulate an onscreen object. For the latter the inventory stores a number of items that can only be used in a specific location.\n\nIn terms of puzzles every chapter provides some sort of logic puzzle. Emma's journal provides tips on how to complete these. For the jewel boards jewels collected in each location provide extra currency to buy power-ups to use in jewel boards. In between chapters you get a scrolling screen where you must locate as many specified items as possible in order to get more jewels. Once this is all done you can move onto the next chapter.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145061,"FileName":"dfa26b04-662f-4fa8-b2e5-bdd10a976605.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145061,"FileName":"433528e9-7d71-4927-b408-ec4b4b7e0196.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145061,"FileName":"79da32c8-3933-4de5-98d9-90afa538006b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":145061,"FileName":"069c932d-fcce-42b9-bf97-6558e6fb5747.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145062,"Name":"Jewel Quest: The Sapphire Dragon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After crash-landing on a frozen mountain Raj makes an incredible discovery in Jewel Quest 6: The Sapphire Dragon!

This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.\n\nBoasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.\n\nThe hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.\n\nFind and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.\n\nPlayers can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf1aplPQczM","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Project Sora","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"921c3b3f-5eaf-4687-83df-5e1dee70443d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"4daaf6d7-fefb-4ca4-befb-d478319cedb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"a3275ddc-3b5b-488b-b25e-9bf2d287fc59.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"d80e81bd-9f7b-46d8-9056-7a7625895f0d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"236a1be6-9a05-4c0f-800f-6ebdd667fd08.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"86c27879-a92c-4f7a-a055-5745951363dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"9eb885f7-eb33-41d7-b7fe-35245d9efc8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"f46867bb-863a-4b45-8d2b-a8910771e126.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"50cc62d6-7cae-44c7-ada3-d1b582e9c0f0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"3eba9f2b-6fa2-47b1-8e9b-e0bbc396d2fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"2e81fee6-e9ed-478a-9690-45f62dd355a9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"81826dbe-1bf7-4c00-a0b5-cb5802f3737e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"0ca800a9-8268-4c71-813f-60045d90e18f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"777c3886-3401-4481-9b5c-c4b812856fb5.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"36995cc4-9664-4333-8f3a-7fb142f04ff8.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"5bbad327-d339-4d63-bdf0-5f1e4649c9e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":12598,"FileName":"ea087bba-f38a-4322-b7f2-39fb8ae696a9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":12598,"AlternateName":"Shin Hikari Shinwa: Palutena no Kagami","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":12014,"Name":"Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"King Mickey and Yen Sid prepare for an impending threat by putting Sora and Riku through the Mark of Mastery exam.

The game follows the same mechanics as the original Kirby game, Kirby's Dream Land, meaning there is no copy ability, like in future iterations of the series. The main difference in Kirby’s Blowout Blast is the introduction of the 3D environment, which changes the gameplay around. For instance, Kirby can now spit enemies he has swallowed in several different directions, with the introduction of a small arrow to indicate the direction Kirby will spit the enemy out.\n\nEven though the game is fully playable in 2D, the use of the 3D gimmick gives the world a much greater sense of depth, and can sometimes help with the gameplay, just like it happened in Planet Robobot.\n\nEach completed stage awards the player with bonus points, depending on how fast the stage was finished, how many enemies were killed, if all coins were collected and if damage was avoided. A gold ranking (or higher) will unlock the EX versions of the corresponding world, and since there are initially five worlds to beat, obtaining that rank in each single world will double the game’s length, making 10 worlds available.\n\nKirby themed Amiibo work with the game, unlocking several cosmetic extras.

It is the tenth installment of the Kirby series and was released in October 2010 in Japan and North America and in February 2011 in Australia and Europe. It is the first entry in the Kirby series on a home console since 2003's Kirby Air Ride and its first home console platform game since 2000's Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. \n\nThe game follows Kirby, who has been transformed into yarn and sent to Patch Land, a world made completely out of fabric. He must help Prince Fluff by collecting seven pieces of magic yarn that are used to stitch Patch Land together in order to stop the game's antagonist, Yin Yarn. Kirby's Epic Yarn utilizes a unique craft-based visual style; the game's characters and environments consist entirely of yarn, fabric, and other craft materials. Unlike most games in the Kirby series, Kirby is unable to inhale or fly, instead relying on the ability to morph into other objects, such as a parachute, a car, and a submarine, as well as larger objects such as a tank and a steam train. \n\nThe third game developed by Good-Feel in tandem with Nintendo, Kirby's Epic Yarn was originally proposed by Madoka Yamauchi, who came up with the idea of a \"world of yarn\" as a video game. It began development as \"Keito no Fluff\", a game starring Prince Fluff as the main protagonist, before the starring character was eventually switched to Kirby. The game's graphical style was created via digital images of real-life fabrics which were placed over polygons. The game's music was composed by Tomoya Tomita. \n\nBefore the game's release, Kirby's Epic Yarn won numerous awards at E3 2010 including Game of the Show from GameSpot. It was released later that year to largely positive reviews, receiving an Editor's Choice award from IGN, who ranked it as #95 in their \"Top 100 Modern Games\". As of April 2011, it has sold 1.59 million copies worldwide. It was re-released digitally via the Wii U eShop in Europe and Australia on May 21, 2015, in North America on July 28, 2016, and in Japan on August 9, 2016. A spiritual successor to Kirby's Epic Yarn titled Yoshi's Woolly World was released in 2015 for the Wii U. A port of the game for the Nintendo 3DS entitled Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn was released on March 8, 2019.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Ninendo","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164534,"FileName":"8428860f-d45b-41a7-adaa-cf951b57d5ed.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":164534,"FileName":"ffe2f34c-d85c-4b85-9148-f336657c44ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":164534,"FileName":"49b99e57-81b8-4eda-bfca-845a5f4d1bad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164534,"FileName":"fc8e5550-e6ac-402f-aa2d-d55ecb385aa8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164534,"FileName":"3c6be008-433d-444a-a61a-4b6400e62c31.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":164534,"FileName":"2289da7d-618a-4880-9359-658f1bfeb83d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164534,"AlternateName":"Kirby, Mas: En el Reino de los Hilos","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":148984,"Name":"Kirby's Pinball Land","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kirby's Pinball Land is a game of pinball based on the Kirby series of games, with Kirby as the ball.

Each screen has a variety of things to do. The middle screen will give access to some sort of bonus game, where you must try to get as many points as you can, and can add to your bonus and bonus multiplier. The bonus is added to your score when you lose a life, as in ordinary pinball.\n\nThe aim is to defeat each boss. To get to the boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary screen. The bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or both of the flippers.

There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:\n\nStar Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.\n\nFriend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.\n\nBomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.\n\nHard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.\n\nThe game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":148985,"FileName":"ea8f9336-c146-4c4a-9bde-cc8c810b0c8a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":148985,"FileName":"51445e50-8a67-4572-bd4d-d5ecdc9ef9df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154648,"Name":"Kobayashi ga Kawai Sugite Tsurai!!

The Kokuga is suspended on four \"legs\" and features a single turret capable of rotating 360 degrees using the shoulder buttons.\n\nEach stage has the player move through destroying other mechanical, tank-like, turret-like, and robotic enemies. Most stages end with massive and varied boss battles. Stages are separated into segments with large gates at the dividers--destroying all enemies before destroying the divider resorts in bonus shield repairs. Destroying the gate without defeating all the enemies in that section merely results in all enemies therein being annihilated.\n\nKokuga differentiates itself from most other shooters in a variety of ways. Rather than collecting power-ups, players already have 20 \"cards\" to utilize. Of these 20 attack and support cards, four are randomly displayed on the touch-screen at a time and offer a variety of abilities, from an offensive laser ring around the player, to homing shots, to shield restoration and damage repairs. Players cannot cycle through the cards, and in order to get new ones, at least one current card must be used. In this way, the game offers an unusual strategy element to the shooter gameplay--careful and planned use of power-up cards over simply powering up as much as possible as soon as possible.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action;

As luck would have it, youve got some cracking secret weapons like Technoblades, as well as sweet rides for vehicular supremacy - fancy a spin in Coles Earth Mech or Zanes Ninjacopter?\n\nAs you bash your way through the city, youll sneak into the ominous Borg Tower and take on Tech Wu. But as well as flexing your muscles, youd better have acute mental power to solve puzzles, hack computers and beat minigames. Take control of different characters for certain sections, helping you mix up your technique, before dropping you into the Digiverse for the ultimate showdown!\n\nWhen youre done for the day, why not chill at the Hub in New Ninjago City? Prove youre the best of the best in Grand Sensei Dareths Dojo - theres even a surprise to be uncovered through shiny Gold Bricks...","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Hellbent Games","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

When you progress through the levels, you will start with just one pyramid, but this will change over time, and you must play against two (or even more) scarab groups simultaneously.\n\nTo help you, and make the game more interesting, there are plenty of power-ups available, like fireballs and lightning bolts for destroying multiple spheres, stopping, slowing down, and reversing the movement of all enemy scarabs for a few seconds, precision shots (with an aiming help), and some others.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146728,"FileName":"262870aa-e0af-49bb-a1b0-ccc070a8e9d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":146728,"FileName":"a27148fa-b988-414c-a77c-97de27ac649e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":146728,"FileName":"89b55814-f96d-45e3-afbf-c64e75d1382d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146728,"FileName":"c4fda31d-4575-4a92-a756-190b9214cdb9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":148999,"Name":"Mad Dog McCree","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mad Dog McCree and his gang have kidnapped the Mayor and his daughter, and its up to you to rescue them.

The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.\n\nHowever, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.\n\nAugust 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.\n\nAugust 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGUmXUOLbtY","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Stealth","Developer":"Kojima Productions","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"56fe6747-f2dd-4f65-a185-85d838c39887.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"db5d90d4-ba46-45f8-ac9b-3bac00db4a2e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"ea824554-ddc1-4d34-b6a3-2609d488d130.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"7b52d6eb-80fa-421c-bc06-28b16aab52a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"fc806f62-37b1-4f09-a261-15068e525eb4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"697ca041-26ef-4539-b4f0-3086e37849ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"a1691ea1-7935-47c6-8223-c73555f6203e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"65fa2e68-2f9a-491e-a778-2d87cb595df1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"bd501a48-fde3-417c-a648-a4b6501e484c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"cf099b2d-14a6-42a7-8431-6c14c3588764.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"4cb3f601-9e01-4527-9477-1044e246d565.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"19a92c7c-f4e2-48ff-b5e0-317f1c9c4d5b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"c55554fb-956a-40d8-a1c9-53c0f20f7ac2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"0a53fbfe-64fc-4a45-ab58-f8107b019326.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"c590849c-5b93-41b4-86cb-84aa3d90dc09.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14141,"FileName":"71f7934f-6b76-44e5-b367-f889dcd61b9c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":14141,"AlternateName":"Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":154707,"Name":"Metal Max 4: Gekkou no Diva","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154707,"FileName":"7ee8caf3-0191-4e8b-a3d4-e0bcbba1bbb5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":142315,"Name":"Metroid Prime: Blast Ball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter; Sports","Developer":"Next Level Games","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":142315,"FileName":"819db08a-ff03-455c-bd08-b4d9549cd163.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142315,"FileName":"10ef15e3-0d3c-4d51-8380-e8a0c15a285c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":35013,"Name":"Metroid Prime: Federation Force","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Metroid Prime: Federation Force 3DS.

It also introduces some features that are new to the 2D Metroid games, such as melee counterattacks, an ability to fire freely at any angle, and a selection of different abilities. The development on Samus Returns began in 2015, with longtime Metroid developer Yoshio Sakamoto producing it.

Unexpectedly, robots across the United States begin to go haywire and attack anyone and everything, leaving the humanoid Beck and Call as the only bots still functioning properly. Beck is a combat robot and the latest in the Mighty Numbers line, and the only among them able to manipulate Xels, the nanomachines that all robots are comprised of. Thus, he is asked by his creator, Dr. White, to bring the other Mighty Numbers back to their senses and discover the source of the robot affliction.\n\nGameplay is heavily inspired by the Mega Man series, and consists of running and gunning across platform levels while defeating enemies along the way. Beck's basic weapon is fairly weak, but once he has sufficiently damaged an enemy, he can dash into them to instantly defeat them and absorb their Xels. Each enemy has a different type of Xel, which can grant Beck temporary power-ups such as healing or increased defense. After defeating another Mighty Number in a boss battle, Beck may also use their unique Xels to transform and gain new weaponry. Call is also available in co-op play; while she cannot absorb Xels, she falls slower, dashes farther, and has a shield that absorbs projectiles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Abstraction Games","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35278,"FileName":"4240f635-ae33-41eb-a3db-c2c285e29b87.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":35278,"FileName":"c90cc8e0-9d71-4b04-b037-fd72d6208d1d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21217,"Name":"Mighty Switch Force!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Space Hooligans have escaped custody and are wreaking havoc all over Planet Land!\n\nHQ calls on cybernetic peace-keeper Patricia Wagon to bring these renegades to justice.

The alien ends up, by way of general bad luck, stuck on hostile alien worlds where he must, essentially, shoot his way through hordes of alien octopuses to escape. The shooter gameplay is built with an aim assist which allows for faster and smoother gameplay than the much older Smash TV style.\n\nA mild RPG-style experience and perks system backs the basic gameplay in a unique way. Players earn experience quickly, and can add perks to their character, such as increasing the rate of fire of the weapons, making reloads faster, improving health, etc. Unlike a traditional RPG (or similar game), these perks are not permanent and do not carry over after a level is finished. In this way, players can tweak their character every level to what may be specifically beneficial at the time. If a player wants to specify speed for a level, they may. If they want to emphasize health, they may.\n\nPlayers may earn money by completing levels or by picking up money during gameplay, and this can be used to purchase weapons, weapon upgrades, items, and a few permanent perks. Money is also earned by gaining rank in the game through the completion of various achievement-like Missions. The player is given three of these at a time, and competing each one works toward building ranks. These Missions are typically number-based, i.e. kill 100 of a certain enemy, kill 500 enemies with a certain weapon, use an item 50 times, etc.\n\nThere is a variety of weapons including the default SMG, a shotgun, an electric gun, rocket launcher, grenades, mines, etc. The primary game is a story mode with 60 levels, and a survival mode which may be played on any of the three planets. Weapon upgrades carry over to Survival mode.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":149315,"FileName":"baee52fa-d054-4626-85c0-6b77b9159f31.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":149315,"FileName":"6eb8c205-b8f4-4a44-9508-16fafbb2d29f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":149315,"FileName":"72ef4661-3798-4785-b9b4-6e2bbb379fb0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154715,"Name":"Monster Strike","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Monster Strike has been compared to competitor Puzzle & Dragons and other freemium puzzle games in that the player battles waves of monsters to collect them, fuse them, and evolve them and earn gold and other items through gameplay to get stronger monsters, and build a list of friends with monsters to use as well. What sets it apart is that rather than being a tile-matching video game, the player aims and flicks their monsters around on a field, similar to billiards/pool,[5] bumping off of walls and enemies to perform damage. Colliding the currently in play monster with any of the allied monsters activates Bump Combos (友情コンボ, Yūjō Konbo, \"Friend Combos\") that set off explosions, energy beams, or projectiles to perform damage on opponent monsters. Every turn, numerous counters on enemy monsters count down to launch various attacks that deal damage or add hazards to the field. Player monsters often have other unique passive abilities to counter these hazards, or may have passive abilities that cause greater damage to particular kinds of enemy monsters. Some monsters also have gauges that when it is launched at the right time, it activates a secondary gauge ability as well as slightly increases their attack strength. Each of the player's monsters also has its own counter, which allows the player to activate the monster's Strike Shot (ストライクショット, Sutoraiku Shotto) attack to perform more damage. The final battle of each Quest Mission features a Boss monster that has a moving critical hit point. Monster Strike also offers co-operative play for up to 4 players.[2][6][7]\n\nQuests in the game are divided into Solo and Co-Op and then Normal and Event. Event Quests are only available for limited periods of time and often feature rare monsters that are powerful or that can be used in the Ascension of other monsters. Completing the levels of a quest awards the player monsters, catalysts, and coins. In Normal Quests, for completing the penultimate level in the quest, players are awarded a rare catalyst and for completing the final level, they are awarded an Orb as well as unlocking a Bonus Level featuring the experience-increasing or high-selling turtle monsters. A Mission Log is also given to players to reach certain goals in Quests to win other Catalysts, Orbs, or experience-increasing monsters. A third set of Quests are available in the Temple of Heroes. Clearing any of these awards the player Ableberries (わくわくの実, Wakuwaku no Mi, \"Exciting Fruit\") that gives one of the player's monsters an additional stat bonus. Initially, only certain Hatcher monsters could have an Ableberry. Later, the ability for rare Event Quest monsters to have Ableberries was added, but only if the player has Max Luck on two copies of the same monster. A Tower of Champions event is also occasionally run in Japan, providing an increased challenge for players to win rare monsters and prizes. A similar event was held in the North American version of the game for Christmas 2015.\n\nEach monster has its own HP, Attack, and Speed statistics. The player's three monsters' HP and their friend or helper's monsters' HP are combined for a total HP. Attack determines how much damage the player's monster does to enemy monsters and Speed determines how fast (how much distance) the monster travels in a single turn. These values are increased by fusing monsters together to gain experience, or using special stat-only increasing monsters. There is also a Luck (ラック, Rakku) value, symbolized by a four-leaf clover, that determines the possibility of obtaining bonus prizes at the end of a Mission. Luck can only be increased by fusing two of the same monsters together, or monsters in the same evolutionary line; fusing two Red Smydras or a Red Drake and a Red Smydra will both cause Luck to increase. An additional Luck Skill was added to the game, allowing certain monsters to either have a critical hit or a shield to prevent damage on one turn.\n\nAfter raising a monster to its maximum level, the player can Evolve (進化, Shinka) them through the use of Evolution Catalysts (進化アイテム, Shinka Aitemu, \"Evolution Items\"). Players can also Ascend (神化, Kamika) their monsters into even more powerful forms through the use of other monsters with specific Luck levels. Divination (獣神化, Jūshinka) is a combination of the two evolutions, giving the monster a second tier to their Strike Shot and a second slot for an Ableberry.\n\nThe game also features Hatchers (ガチャ, Gacha) that the player spends either Friend Points (earned through choosing another player's monster to complete a level) for fairly common monsters or Orbs for rarer monsters. The main Hatcher cycles through a series of different sets of monsters that have an increased availability, with the rarest found during the Legend Series (獣神祭, Jūshinsai) events. The Friend Hatcher is sometimes used for giving out rare Event monsters for collaborations, such as with Line Corporation and Weekly Shōnen Jump in Japan. The Japanese edition of the game has also featured a special Hatcher to commemorate the release of Godzilla requiring special Godzilla Sharls to use it. Collaborations have also been made with Lawson's convenience store chain, Monster Hunter Big Game Hunting Quest, Bakusō Kyōdai Let's & Go!!, Game Walker, Parasyte, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Rebuild of Evangelion and Ultraman.[8]\n\nThe game has an in-game store to purchase Orbs that are used to continue lost Missions, expand the number of the player's available saved monsters, restore Stamina used to play Missions, or use them in the game's Hatcher to earn powerful and rare monsters.[9]","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154715,"FileName":"6ecf1e5b-5dda-4103-8d32-d55ae3e8434e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":107503,"Name":"Moon Chronicles","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Moon, the year is 2058 and the United States has established a series of stations on the moon to perform scientific experiments and construct a Mars launch facility.

Rather than a true simulation, it espouses realistic control, driving, and physics for much more hectic and over-the-top arcade racing, complete with many typical arcade racing features such as boosting and drifting, and the like. It has several features from both simulator-style racing games (e.g. NASCAR 09) and from arcade racing games (such as Burnout). Authentic NASCAR tracks are present in the game, but most \"break out\" from the track and into the surrounding city area, hence the \"Unleashed\" aspect. Pit lanes remain and are important for vehicle repairs and obtaining Slingshot boosts. A 15-driver \"All-Stars\" list of NASCAR drivers and their cars is present in the game, though all control identically. Drafting (lowering air resistance, and increasing speed by driving behind other cars) is also present.\n\nBesides drifting and boosting, the game features wild arcade-infused physics which often see cars barrel-rolling through the air, and collisions are rampant. Cars can be wrecked and players will routinely create Rivals, who become much more aggressive opponent racers. Should the player be wrecked, he has the ability to perform a Payback wreck on the Rival.\n\nThe boost meter is filled through extremely aggressive driving, slamming other cars, wrecking other cars, drifting, and drafting. Filling the boost meter gives the player the ability to use a Slingshot boost to race quickly around opponents, and the time limit on a boost tends to depend on the skill of a player to maintain the car around obstacles, walls, and other cars.\n\nChallenges routinely present themselves during each race. Completing challenges adds to the boost meter, and are occasionally part of secondary race challenges. An in-race challenge may be as simple as reaching a certain position in the race or destroying obstacles on the tracks, or may require a bit more attention, such as creating Rivals or performing successful drifts.\n\nThe included game modes are:\n\n    Championship - The standard career mode with three tiers of difficulty where the player progresses through several races with the goal of finishing within a specific place such as placing in the top 12 or top 5. Each track features two secondary challenges such as creating a set number of Rivals or performing a set number of Drifts. Can be played by one or two players.\n\n    Quick Race - Simple races that can be performed on any track, or in small, player-created career-style modes.

When not playing in co-op, the other ones are controller by the AI. During the game the turtles have to be upgraded. This can be done by collecting points by defeating enemies and breaking items. Health of any of the turtles is increased by eating pizza's, sushi and other food items.

After his defeat, the body of Darnacus was never found and Doppelori, a cyborg clone of Lori, Noitu Love's helper, was kept imprisoned. The sequel stars Xoda Rap (Paradox spelled backwards) as the protagonist. She receives a call about an army of grinning robots threatening Omicron City.\n\nJust like the first game, Noitu Love 2: Devolution is a fast side-scrolling game. Players guide Xoda Rap to find the evil mastermind behind the attack. The main character can no longer transform into different shapes through the Evomatics device. Instead, a mouse-based targeting system is introduced. Xoda is controlled through keyboard keys while the mouse is used to guide a cursor for aiming and shooting. There are basic punches, air attacks, wall jumps and temporary shields. Special moves include an upwards wheel attack and powerful dives to the sides of the screen. Xoda can also grab enemies in the air and use a charged attack. Matching the game's speed, Xoda can build up combos by attacking multiple enemies at once, as long as she does not touch the ground. While playing, Xoda receives information from Dr. Almond through an intercom, much like Lori in the first game.\n\nEach level comes with different bosses that require a strategic approach. Certain areas also have Xoda fly a floating device. Health can be replenished and expanded through power-ups. At the end of each level, the player is ranked based on time, score and the amount of kills. After finishing the game, new difficulty modes, new enemies and an option to watch the records become available. Also, two more playable characters can be unlocked, of which one is Doppelori. She has completely new moves and a very different playing style. Unlike the first game, the sequel is not freeware but sold as a digital download for $20.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"MP2 Games","Publisher":"MP2 Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":150374,"FileName":"27d56525-de91-4885-ba64-0f4c5f4d1dca.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":150374,"FileName":"cd3ba37e-d239-4c01-8e41-9fb9d56b8976.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":150374,"FileName":"93b202c4-7fd7-4898-a411-75c39563758e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150374,"FileName":"ff212893-4089-44af-95f4-190661c170bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154877,"Name":"Nuigurumi no Cakeyasan: Mahou no Patissiere","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154877,"FileName":"6eb9857c-d654-4f45-9f3e-b021be3b9178.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":149322,"Name":"Ocean Runner","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Meet Gilbert, a bachelor fish who has fallen deeply in love with the beautiful Pearlina.

There are also sections where the player can blow into the microphone to send a gust of wind -- for example, to blow a dangling spider out of the way.

Dual Destinies features the return of series protagonist Phoenix Wright as a practicing lawyer and playable character, having regained his attorney's badge after the events of Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. Apollo Justice also returns in this installment as a playable character. The men are joined at the agency by Athena Cykes, a rookie lawyer with a personal connection to a few of the cases in the game.\n\nLike previous games in the series, gameplay in Dual Destinies is broken up into two distinct segments: investigation and trial. In the investigation phase, the player navigates through a series of screens, searching for clues and interviewing witnesses. Items and other pertinent information found are added to the court record for use during the trial phase. In the trial phase, witnesses take the stand, and the player is given the opportunity to present evidence that contradicts their testimony. Dual Destinies also features the return of two additional gameplay mechanics introduced earlier in the series: the \"Psyche-Lock,\" where witnesses during the investigation phase refuse to divulge information, forcing the player to present evidence to get them to talk; and the \"Perceive System\" in the trial phase, where the player looks for non-verbal tells that a witness is hiding something. The addition of Athena as a playable character introduces the \"Mood Matrix,\" where Athena is capable of scanning the emotions of a witness to locate the parts of their testimony that cause them the most distress or where their mood contradicts what they're saying.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2013-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"388cbea1-fdf5-42a1-948e-628c4cb57e28.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"256e9762-6b7f-474b-94d5-a2aa57fbbf4e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"3c3c5323-0e25-4d05-867d-98f753aabaa3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"031f0646-af2a-4031-b953-3395eaabffd0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"56f593a8-d915-43d6-bf41-173b8ef36a23.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"167a7819-5fa8-43b5-a800-b901ede8572c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"f39a27e6-38d9-4753-9f0b-cb03471303bc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"e1467018-c3f4-43ce-bf30-81e2ac5fb2e5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"64ffa28c-c7b7-4c24-8b01-def0321fac8a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"440f4b7b-4378-474c-9958-4a3634458cc3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"1c85341e-b4f6-4e25-8488-d19e35636742.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"1ab2d851-dc4f-4b20-af70-47aabda00b31.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"3721557d-b95e-47ad-b514-92a1b6160d0c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21220,"FileName":"2437cc91-7a09-4db4-9f1d-b85b7fa248ab.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":21220,"AlternateName":"Gyakuten Saiban 5","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":115701,"Name":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Spirit of Justice","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice sees Phoenix in a brand new location: a courtroom situated in the Kingdom of Khura'in, origin of the Kurain Channeling Technique, where mysterious séance trials decide the fate of all defendants.

The usual rules of picross apply, but are also supplemented by the special abilities of the Pokémon available within this game. Every time a puzzle is completed, its corresponding Pokémon is captured and can be used in subsequent puzzles to provide special powers, including automatically fixing the first few mistakes the player makes, revealing several squares when the puzzle starts, and hinting at which row to work on next.\n\nPicrites are a form of currency introduced in the game. With them, players can unlock new areas, increase the number of support Pokémon they can use per puzzle, and bypass the cooldown times assigned to Pokémon abilities. An energy meter limits the number of squares a player can fill in before they need to take a break, and Picrites can be used to fill the meter, increase the max energy, and eventually remove the meter entirely. Although Picrites can be earned for free by finishing the daily training mode, earning achivements, and solving the main puzzles, additional Picrites can be purchased through the Nintendo eShop. There is a purchase limit of 5000 Picrites, at which point no more money can be spent on the game, and additional Picrites can then be obtained for free in batches of 1000 at a time.\n\nThere are over 600 puzzles in the game. The basic, main set of puzzles is grouped into several different areas that can be traveled to.Sometimes, the player can earn a mural piece by completing a main puzzle under specific circumstances, which will unlock a new mural puzzle. These puzzles don't cost any stamina to play, but support Pokémon cannot be used on them, and they do not award any Picrites. However, full completion of a mural board will unlock Primal Groudon or Primal Kyogre. Lastly, every main puzzle has a Mega Picross variant with more difficult clues to work out.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Jupiter Corporation","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2015-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128613,"FileName":"f508aa8d-ae5e-4f8a-8435-78fefa584f6a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128613,"FileName":"d39517de-14a9-4074-b391-e9cd22fb2f5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":128613,"FileName":"02394bb5-6ef8-429f-940b-c851a9176cbf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128613,"FileName":"d7bcfd30-8aed-4e27-9e17-a9a3558e4785.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128613,"AlternateName":"Pokemon Picross","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":12725,"Name":"Pokemon Rumble Blast","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pokémon Rumble Blast, the first Pokémon game created exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS system, is an action-packed Pokémon adventure in 3D!

Hyper Training allows players to boost their Pokémon's individual values, hidden values that impact a Pokémon's potential for stat growth and are otherwise immutable. The new Battle Royal mode pits four trainers against each other in a free-for-all fight where the goal is to score the most KOs while trying not to let one's own Pokémon faint. A group of islands called Poké Pelago allow the player's Pokémon to play and collect items while they aren't in the active party, and each island can be upgraded to provide more and better rewards. Lastly, a location called the Festival Plaza acts as the multiplayer hub, and combines features from prior games' Join Avenue and PSS systems.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/Iylfh-7uQkc","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Game Freak","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"dc070115-eeec-4306-907e-5cebf934da0c.png","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"dc1e3752-45db-41c5-8474-6cc9f56bbf30.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"63089ca2-d89f-46a6-addd-a17553684a01.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"d49bd657-36ed-4248-b2d3-0118f9f679cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"110b5cce-32fc-45c7-a8ad-0fcfae9654df.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"2853812a-b2e8-44a1-a354-4f6be8f7ce75.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"c99bf404-60cb-484b-8993-464e65b7463a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"fd1c2a8c-5022-4cf4-85dc-aab9ea23a638.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"f0f2143f-0030-4d34-ae3a-dc5f06919c08.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"e6de855c-2f57-40e0-8c6a-bd03240aa74d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"bc87d702-b1a4-4191-b767-556dc45f025a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"d3fa05ec-d9b9-49be-bdb4-967787195628.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"a6786790-18b7-459f-bbf0-fd8683f844c7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"f2ec6621-1ce0-4708-b11c-d98c530c0558.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"be04f377-4180-44fb-b944-8a448cf19630.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"9ad8dc9f-9332-4915-861d-42522f9b9319.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"9bbae3f0-7742-4385-82e5-5b5104728c91.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"4c5557f6-7776-4ffa-ba60-c7aad8fbf92f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"52bb161f-9bf3-4a76-8bd1-374265d35b63.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"995186e1-01e3-4b05-8d4a-d8478980e15c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"4b1e07f3-4aa3-46d9-8af8-95a82c1d766b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"42576bb1-ccd9-4abc-91c3-9623b0df31d0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"FileName":"f0175796-69af-4eba-ada0-038e876a05e5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":119662,"AlternateName":"Pokémon Sun","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119662,"AlternateName":"Pocket Monsters Sun","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"AlternateName":"Pokémon Sole","Region":"Italy"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"AlternateName":"Pokemon Sun","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":119662,"AlternateName":"Pokémon Sol","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":128612,"Name":"Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon Special Demo Version","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Game Freak","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128612,"FileName":"1fc07cf5-447d-4597-92b5-d9bc4b145b1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128612,"AlternateName":"Pocket Monsters Sun and Moon Special Demo Version","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128612,"AlternateName":"Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon Special Demo Version","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":33562,"Name":"Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The definitive Pokémon Mystery Dungeon!

The game is played as a side-scrolling platformer, but at a slower pace with more focus on exploration and puzzle elements to juggle different abilities to reach the captured characters, even though there are many enemies present. To complete a level all other blobs need to be freed and then the area can be exited through a door.\n\nAs an amorphous blob, Putty has a number of abilities. He can stretch in the four major directions to reach items or move up platforms. He can also jump and flatten himself completely to avoid enemies. He has different types of attacks that can be upgraded throughout the game, ranging from a simple punch to electrical shocks and darts. Not all available abilities are available right away, they are upgraded or become available by collecting stars in levels. There are different types of items and these can be absorbed to use them at a later date. These are restored in a bar on the right side of the screen where they can be selected. Putty can for instance launch rockets, throw bombs, activate a shield, or call in a pod that provides free movement anywhere in the level for 30 seconds. He is also able to inflate and then use an hot air stream to scale heights, but only for a limited amount of time.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"System 3","Publisher":"Maximum Games","ReleaseDate":"2013-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":145151,"FileName":"d4c36586-a71f-434d-ac2c-9c3ec6b27549.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145151,"FileName":"a2346194-56a1-4931-bb18-34cc725e4ea0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145151,"FileName":"d25255c7-2652-496b-9d04-c23920dec8d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":145151,"FileName":"769b4874-3ff5-4685-89dd-0ba56773736c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":145151,"FileName":"afd68455-989a-44c8-a0ef-a04c5f82d064.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":145151,"FileName":"8fa5ee0a-ff9a-4612-a41e-730329c5172e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":152966,"Name":"Puyo Puyo Chronicle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Puyo Puyo Chronicleis a game for the Nintendo 3DS as part of a celebration of Puyo Puyo's 25th Anniversary.

He must fight for his freedom and retribution in a Roman-style arena against a horde of monsters and madmen. The story is told through cutscenes and a first-person narrative.\n\nThe game is played in a manner largely identical to Punch-Out with the exception that it is entirely first-person rather than 'over the shoulder' 3rd person as in Punch-Out. Players face off against a single opponent (referred to as a 'boss') at a time over three difficulty levels. These difficulties operate as the different circuits of the aforementioned Nintendo classic, but feature the same line of foes and with an additional character per higher difficulty. The player does not move around the arena, but must carefully monitor and respond to the opponents in order to deliver successful attacks. This involves learning opponent attack patterns, dodging, and attacking successfully. Upon reaching higher levels, players are not simply treated to a 'harder' version of the same opponent as before--enemies tend to feature new attacks and new patterns entirely, which requires the player to modify what they had learned on lower difficulties. Players can dodge or jump over attacks, or hold up a shield which blocks many energy attacks.\n\nThe bosses, or enemies, cover a variety of mythical Greco-Roman themes and other fantasy creatures, ranging from an apparent Orc to a Minotaur and a Beholder. Perhaps curiously in a game with overall Greco-Roman themes, the player's \"tutor\" (also an opponent) is of an East Asian characterization. There are a few other human-like opponents as well. Each character has it's own very distinct design and style of fighting, though the same basic concept defines the gameplay throughout--learn the attacks, counter appropriately.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Ghostfire Games","Publisher":"Gamelion Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2013-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146619,"FileName":"8365e341-45c9-47df-bcd1-69b4ccfc6f41.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146619,"FileName":"88527f40-1992-454a-aad5-ed39eb93ed18.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146619,"FileName":"d6f1e2bc-b41e-4596-992e-1fbedb8feea6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146619,"FileName":"3f6cf296-e772-4a47-b708-c4758887d553.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146619,"FileName":"b88d493e-bacf-40ff-8b22-392504b328b1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146619,"FileName":"b4f12822-7fd5-4ba3-b5b1-8848d392a26e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154913,"Name":"Raishi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154913,"FileName":"d87fc102-e20e-47d9-adc3-5f7c1ef536cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":154914,"Name":"Raishi: Konpeki no Shou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":154914,"FileName":"f9bed136-1acb-4edd-92d4-5b220b79b9d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":12777,"Name":"Rayman 3D","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"One of the most popular franchises of all time lands on Nintendo 3DS with an outstanding platform experience that will take advantage of the Nintendo 3DS specifications with impressive graphics, stunning 3D effects and full use of the Circle Pad.

This is done by drawing lines across the shapes. For each level the player can do a set number of slices and has to create a specific number of equally sized smaller pieces. If the pieces differ too much in size the level will be failed, however the pieces does not have to be in the same shape. When succeeding with a level the player gets a star rating between one to five. The closer the pieces are to each other the better rating will be earned. The game starts out with simple shapes like squares and triangles but as the player progresses through it the shapes get increasingly more complex.\n\nThe game has a hint system to help players who get stuck.

The race doesn't always go through tunnels, at times it transforms to a flat surface and sometimes the player finds himself racing on the outside of the tunnel.\n\nThe player can collect bonuses that he comes across at the track. Each bonus can be used once and it's only possible to have one at a time. They are activated simply by touching the screen (except for the shields which are automatically activated). The bonuses available are shields (orange fields on the track) that can be used to destroy obstacles, quakes (red fields) that destroy all visible obstacles, time dilatation (blue fields) that slows down the game and freezes moving objects, and space folds (green fields) that end hazard zones. Hazards includes blackouts where the tunnel is rendered in negative, gravity wells that limits the visibility and distorts the vision, dark nebulas where the cubes are in negative, hue shifts that are full of different colors, and plasma clouds where the player can collide with a vortex that resets all bonuses.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Bytestorm","Publisher":"Gamelion Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2012-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"651cb62c-04a5-4335-91c0-898e7a5d1003.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"aa191fdc-5ee9-4084-a84d-3bc7bd63a024.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"380ea73a-dd58-4108-8d2f-6c009c4770e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"68e1bbb6-cc4d-4c4a-8603-32fcf6b703fd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"54ed4f57-5344-4f96-bb80-ecc6c0e39b72.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"5978b77a-e1cc-437e-a181-ba4b20a37a2b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146374,"FileName":"37d7b387-0140-4b8f-a359-ae1bbacfc61e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":149446,"Name":"SpeedX 3D Hyper Edition","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Speedx 3D Hyper Edition is the fastest tunnel racer ever!

The game is played on a board full of hexagonal tiles with numbers and operators on them and the player's task is to link these together so that new numbers are created. This is done by making swipes between adjacent numbers and operators. To progress in the game the player has to reach specific targets. So for example to reach a target of 5 the player can swipe 3 + 2. However, the more steps used in an operation the more points the player will score. Therefore the player instead might choose to swipe 3 x 2 - 1 and get more points. By doing operations in multiple steps it's possible to create chains which is necessary to get a higher rating on some levels. As operations are made tiles are removed from the board until no more operations can be made. Therefore it's important to plan ahead so that all operators aren't used up. Once all targets have been reached more tiles will be dropped onto the board and new targets will be introduced.\n\nThe game has two modes: campaign and endless. Campaign consists of levels that are beaten by reaching a certain number of targets. For each level the player will get a star rating depending on how well he has performed and can then move on to the next level. The campaign is divided into stages and to advance to the next stage a certain number of stars has to earned.

Each \"race\" features its own specific units, a building and spells. Throughout the story campaign the player unlocks these for use. In skirmishes everything is available, but the player must research them in the game using a simple tech tree. There are also challenges available and multi-player.\n\nThe game mechanics are remarkably similar to a RTS game. The player harvests gold from gold mines using a non-combat unit, researches technology to build better units and spells, and uses those to gain map control. Units will automatically walk towards the enemy camp once created, so a steady flow of units will stream from both sides of the map and will clash somewhere in the middle. The aim for the player is to tilt those melees into his advantage by creating the right units to counter enemy units and cast spells to buff friendly units or maim enemy units.\n\nThere's a large variety in units per race, giving each race its own tactics. Vikings are strong, can be healed, can quickly regenerate mana, and their largest unit, the catapult, is far-ranged. Aztecs, on the other hand, have less health and regenerate mana slowly, but they can sacrifice units to regain mana, as well as poison, imprison or dominate enemy units. The Chinese use explosives which make their ranged units more powerful and in addition they have a monkey that can skip past enemy units to attack the rear guard.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":149452,"FileName":"a7783d90-4cc4-47cf-863b-9bff511b0198.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":149452,"FileName":"3be0b34c-5e33-4603-9e10-ae74336abc11.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":149452,"FileName":"68a2faa4-6838-4212-b57b-205c85374045.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150376,"Name":"Symphony of Eternity","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"There's been a coup d'etat in the Kingdom of Eashtend. A traitor, Lady Safiro, takes control and kills most of the royal family with only the young princess being able to escape. Meanwhile a young hero along with his golem companion is searching for Regratlute, a legendary and powerful weapon. While exploring a forest they come across a young girl being attacked by a pack of wolves. The girl claims she is the princess of Eashtend and joins the party. They then decide to find Regratlute and use it to rid Eashtend of the traitor.\n\nSymphony of Eternity is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with turn based combat. The game world consists of towns and battle areas such as dungeons and the player moves between these on the world map. There are no random battles and the player can always see the enemies and try to avoid combat. The combat is round based and for each round each character can make one action. The player can choose between using a standard attack, using a skill (such a spell or special attack) or using an item (such as potions). Standard attacks are physical while skill attacks can be either physical or magical and require magic points. By attacking the same enemy in succession the player can make combinations and thereby increase the damage inflicted. There's also a break option. Each character has a break gauge and when it is filled up the character can interrupt the combat and launch an extra powerful action. Enemies come from different tribes and for each tribe some weapons and skills are more effective. Each enemy also has an weakness for certain magic elements such as fire, water, earth etc.\n\nFor each battle the player earns experience and eventually the characters will level up. When levelling up the character earns a merit point which can be used to strengthen abilities. For every ten merit points allocated to an ability, it's level goes up with one. There are ten abilities in total: physical attack, magic attack, accuracy, critical hit rate, physical defense, magic defense, evasion, resistance, speed and reduced usage. Merit points can also be increased from items and equipment. Both equipment and items can be bought in stores in the villages. Equipment can also be made. Made equipment is more expensive but have more merit points which to some extent can be freely allocated by the player. Characters can also be equipped with tablets which allow them to use different skills and gain special effects.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Kemco","Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"2017-10-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":150376,"FileName":"f220428f-628c-4089-a0da-20e8241370f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":150376,"FileName":"a19f1b1a-3bb5-4070-9ca8-e4d95961f6b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":150376,"FileName":"d3c024c6-285b-4d48-8eeb-8e0cd13ce09f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":150376,"FileName":"638ab350-32c2-48aa-b85e-ebbbe5d84786.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197993,"Name":"Syunsoku Mezase!

You can also introduce Teddy to your friends and family by handing them your Nintendo 3DS family system. Your friends and family can give answers that Teddy will remember and even mention later on.\n\nTeddy loves to eat too, and you can play fun minigames via the Touch Screen to prepare a range of meals to feed Teddy.

Helpless to stop them, Link is asked by the king to meet with a race of tiny people known as the Minish, who may be able to help with their predicament. On his travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a Minish so that he can meet with them. With his newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom from Vaati's menace.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down action adventure game that tells the origins of the evil Vaati from Four Swords. Players take on the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and progress through various obstacles. Items such as the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, items, and propel Link. Link can also shrink down to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the talking cap.\n\nThe Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of shrinking to make familiar territory new and different. Puddles become huge rivers, baby chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies become deadly bosses at Minish size. Link can also trade items called \"Kinstones\" with people in the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone are joined together, new areas open up, treasure chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards are given to Link.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":149033,"FileName":"951813e3-7096-4c24-99cd-02d3fefc4cee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":149033,"FileName":"c7fb3c1f-7a5c-4dbf-b5b3-5ff7587265f0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32311,"Name":"The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Three players take on the role of individual Link characters and team up to work cooperatively to solve puzzles and battle bosses in dungeons.

The player starts the game by choosing which of these Pokémon they will play with; this Pokémon is the group's \"leader\" during the game, and this is the species that the player will initially have as a resource, starting at 50 Pokémon. On the bottom screen before a stage is selected, the player can choose to search for friends (なかまを　さがす) by either receiving them from StreetPass data or by using the Nintendo 3DS's Play Coins. The Pokémon received from a given player by StreetPass will match the leader that that player originally chose in their game, while those received by exchanging Play Coins match the leader that the player originally chose. Play Coins can be exchanged in groups of 5, 10, or 15 coins, and the rate of exchange both varies depending on the amount exchanged (more coins makes a better deal) and on the number of stages the player has completed (ranging from as few as 20/50/90 Pokémon to as many as 75/160/255 Pokémon). There is no other way to gain friends, and since challenging and completing a stage means losing the Pokémon that were sent into it, this may force the player to spend several days completing the game.\n\nThe challenges within a stage take three forms. One is a straightforward battle with a Pokémon guarding the way, one is a sneaking challenge which may turn into a battle if failed, and one is clearing passive obstacles. At any time in any of these challenges, the player may leave the stage, which will leave any Pokémon that are still usable at that spot in the stage; multiple groups can be left at different spots in this fashion. The next time the player plays that stage, just before reaching a spot where a previous group was left, the new group will reunite with the old group and they will join forces. By reuniting with old groups, it is possible to exceed the limit of Pokémon that can normally be brought into the stage, but each species will always be limited to 333 Pokémon (any extras will leave the stage and be lost). Including the nominal leader, this makes it possible to have 1,000 Pokémon in any stage.\n\nIn a battle challenge, the player must defeat enemy Pokémon in a brawl in order to advance. A pair of opposed gauges at the bottom of the top screen measures the relative progress of the player and enemy sides. If the enemy's gauge pushes the player's all the way down to the left, the player loses, but if the player pushes their gauge all the way to the right, they win. The player influences the battle by sending Pokémon from their side into the battle, while the enemy's side may also be joined by reinforcements. Depending on the battle, the enemy may be reinforced by different species at different times throughout the battle. The progress for both sides in the battle is influenced by the type effectiveness between them. The prevailing type on a side is generally determined by the type of the last Pokémon that was sent into it. At the beginning of a battle, an approximately even group of Pokémon from each type in the overall group is automatically sent in; this group's type is dominated by the leader Pokémon's type. After a battle is won, some of the Pokémon the player sent into the battle will be lost and leave the stage.\n\nIn a sneaking challenge, the group spots a guard and can attempt to sneak behind it while it is facing towards the screen. The player holds the X, Y, or A button to direct either the Chespin, Fennekin, or Froakie to sneak past in a group, and the challenge is only passed when all Pokémon have made it past. As a button is held, the group starts slow and gradually moves faster, and if the button is released, any Pokémon who still haven't crossed will immediately withdraw to the starting position. Occasionally during the challenge, the guard will perk up and turn around to check behind it, and if any Pokémon are visible when it is looking behind it, the challenge will devolve into a battle (involving all Pokémon in the group, including those that had already made it across). If, after turning around, the guard sees no one, it will advance its position towards the group's starting position; if the guard advances close enough in this manner, it will spot the group and the challenge will devolve into a battle.\n\nIn an obstacle-clearing challenge, the player is faced with a passive obstacle and must send Pokémon from the group against it to clear it out of the way. The player's progress is measured by a gauge at the bottom of the top screen, but unlike a battle, the obstacle never \"pushes back\". Also unlike a battle, all Pokémon that are sent against an obstacle will leave the stage when the challenge is completed. As with battles, the types on each side influence the player's progress. At the beginning of an obstacle challenge, an approximately even group of Pokémon from each type in the overall group is automatically sent in; this group's type is dominated by the leader Pokémon's type, but otherwise the prevailing type is usually that of the last Pokémon sent in.\n\nOccasionally when sending Pokémon into a battle or against an obstacle, a Pikachu will also jump in as a bonus. Pikachu do a large amount of Electric-type damage with a critical hit. Pikachu may also appear when gathering new friends from StreetPass, but this too is purely random; Pikachu is never a regular part of the player's group.\n\nCompleting stages also increases the number of Pokémon the player can hold onto outside of stages. The capacity for each type of Pokémon starts at 100 and gradually grows until it reaches a maximum of 999.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Marvelous AQL","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2014-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128306,"FileName":"32b1e8bd-2852-4ee2-9527-0e43ff5db080.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":128306,"FileName":"15f074c1-201a-484f-ab90-6f627dcc195b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128306,"AlternateName":"The Thieves and the 1000 Pokémon","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":13168,"Name":"The Trash Pack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Taking out the trash has never been so much FUN!\n\nJoin your favorite Trashies in litter-loaded adventures of the grossest proportions!

It consists of three scenarios split up into multiple levels unlocked gradually. Typical for the genre, a level is completed by surviving a number of waves. The single-screen maps consist of different paths that allow enemy troops to approach from different directions and simultaneously. Their goal is to infiltrate your headquarters, removing health points until none are left. The player has a limited amount of spots to position towers.\n\nThere are four types of towers available: a battery gun, a flame thrower, a tank and an anti-air cannon. They each have a certain cost through money gained by destroying enemies. Each tower has its own health and experience level. A tower needs to be repaired gradually or it is destroyed permanently. Redundant ones can also be sold. When the individual experience meter is full, it is possible to upgrade that tower for money. There are multiple and different upgrade options tied to a persistent upgrade system outside a battle. Money is not carried over across missions, but stars are earned as a second currency. These stars can be spent to unlock and upgrade several skills through a skill tree for each of the four units. Once a skill is unlocked, it can be used in a mission but still needs to be purchased. Upgrades provide faster firing, more damage, and more armour, but also introduce skills such as repairing all towers in one go or reviving destroyed ones.\n\nEnemies include troops, armoured vehicles, tanks and flying bombers. After completing a battle, a number of experienced towers can be selected to take them along to the next battle. The game is played in real-time, with two buttons to either pause the game or to fast-forward it next to the regular flow of time. There are some differences between the versions across platforms, but usually it is a free-to-play game with in-app purchases to unlock two of the three scenarios and to buy additional stars.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Circle Entertainment","Publisher":"CIRCLE Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":174943,"FileName":"ca2aeec8-e1d1-485e-943e-1372549a7183.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":174943,"FileName":"bc850fb7-869b-4c5f-a276-2c497629ad43.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":149461,"Name":"Toy Stunt Bike","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Toy Stunt Bike is a motorbike trial game.

He has settled down and opened an apartment block for monsters. This part of the game is typical hotel management: potential tenants come looking for a room and, if accepted, pay a regular rent. This rent can be reinvested into furniture for the individual rooms to increase the tenant's satisfaction or become more attractive for stronger/richer monsters. Certain furniture types may also increase the tenant's combat statistics. The rent can be adjusted which has a direct influence on the satisfaction. The personalities of each tenant should be taken into consideration while expanding, e.g. certain monster types dislike each other. On the other hand, male and female tenants of the same type may result in result and offspring.\n\nThe second big aspect of the game is combat against adventurers which try to steal Satan's gold. This can be prevented by knocking on the tenants' doors and send them to fight. Here it is important to keep the monsters' statistics into consideration, e.g. ranged attackers should not be sent to the frontlines (which is determined by the order they are sent out). The attacks are wave based, i.e. the attackers stand in line and only two opponents fight each other in melee until one is out. Damaged monsters can be ordered to return to their room. Because monsters leave for work, they may not be available.\n\nMost attacks are initiated by posting a quest on the job board. Those are not only a source of income, but are also required for game progression. It starts with one floor and four apartments, but eventually the player has to manage four floors with overall 16 rooms. Some attacks start without player intervention.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 version introduces some minor changes such as more save slots, a quick tenant overview and the possibility to name the tenants' children.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":200087,"FileName":"3ace9345-291d-46e6-b0d3-284506411aaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200087,"FileName":"2bc559d6-70ce-4ffb-aad3-f4b29ced1ab9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174944,"Name":"Unlucky Mage","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From loner to savior of a nation? \n\n\nThe various powers across the Adamantia continent have long fought one with another in an effort to gain supreme control over the vast regions of land- each ruler and monarch thinking of none but themselves and leeching mercilessly off the labor of those citizens within their borders... \nBut that all begins to change when an untrusting young mage named Jasper, living isolated from society, finds himself involved in a chain of events that is sure to go down in history as the greatest story ever told! \nWith a plot full of twists and turns, Unlucky Mage will have gamers on their toes trying to outsmart foes using formations and tactics in this unique turn-based RPG!

Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike. \n\nAs you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Befriending new Yo-kai may not be so easy, though – in many cases, you will need to battle with them and impress them during your battle. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths and you’ll use them to challenge the evil Yo-kai and help people in need of solving daily problems – like an argument with a friend or forgetting something important – which may be caused by mischievous Yo-kai hidden everywhere.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT5YWlGikdE","Platform":"Nintendo 3DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Level-5","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2015-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"0ac043ed-af7c-417e-bc63-30aa5f3cf78b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"8470a0a6-cd1a-4f03-9264-537e720647a3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"c5b040d8-3bfe-4439-b3a7-fee9535c518f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"35a5666d-b3a2-4b5b-913d-5a0738f1c759.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"75f33a7a-a717-46a7-beea-d443a7a6919d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"a79a1bc6-e189-47a5-86df-2f0f3c9a45ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"2e44900a-3086-430f-9468-c46d448c9d87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"40a2f288-e11a-4e07-955a-5f64103f74c5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"044b7cb2-71c0-472f-b984-571655698bb1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"d1ce8780-cbd5-4acb-bfc5-86bb2e69b18f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"33ad33c6-185c-4c5d-b965-ff44a3dd291d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"c8091ff9-8854-4b0d-a4c5-8a26a2f737d8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"bd6586d1-784f-47eb-ac2c-3cdfdebfcee5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"deded9f1-cf37-44e2-bf3f-04307d39e159.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"bd7db106-8d94-4600-bef6-464a7807ba14.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32748,"FileName":"6233e460-022d-46f7-8bf0-7d76e60311f2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":121783,"Name":"Yo-Kai Watch 2: Bony Spirits","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Watch out!
