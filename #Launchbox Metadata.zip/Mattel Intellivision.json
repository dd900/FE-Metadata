{"Name":"Mattel Intellivision","Games":[{"DatabaseID":31710,"Name":"4-Tris","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":"Tetraminoes are pieces created from 4 blocks joined together into 7 different patterns. By rotating them, you can position the pieces as they are falling so they fill open spaces. When an entire horizontal line fills with the pieces, the line clears and you are on your way to higher levels!\nBlocks will fall from the top of the screen towards the bottom. Arrange the pieces so that a row is completely filled by the blocks. Failing to do so will fill up the screen making it more and more difficult to clear rows. A cleared row will disappear giving you points and making game play easier.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnM6OEfeLAE","Platform":"Mattel Intellivision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Joe Zbiciak","Publisher":"Joe Zbiciak","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"11225009-e16e-4061-b666-874fa82a3fb4.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Control Panel","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"941930ed-55ae-406f-9fd8-23d45b8ae8ef.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"79b98153-2ad7-4f23-8191-4302967e55f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"a43313e5-b5ff-49e2-a2c2-fecc7de228a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"d314f850-345e-4b2d-8c0d-512c8b6e686c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"477408be-dec0-4021-b72e-8c6811519db2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"49410db6-dcc3-4e29-b4e8-fcbdd9335e4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31710,"FileName":"06816da5-02e4-467a-935f-b163f0a98887.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":31710,"AlternateName":"Tetris","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":4049,"Name":"ABPA Backgammon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A real battle of wits and strategy!

You control a can of bug spray at the bottom of the screen, and you need to defend yourself from the swarms of incoming bees. The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get.

Three rows of targets scroll across the screen in alternating directions; these include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If a duck target crosses the bottom row without being shot, it will come to life and begin flying down toward the player. Any ducks that reach the bottom of the screen in this manner will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets or points when hit. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; these pipes and all targets must be shot in order to complete the round. At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins. Later bonus rounds add more bears to the screen. In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHl6V1S73xc","Platform":"Mattel Intellivision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","Publisher":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"5671a070-c723-4833-a577-300474c0555e.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"a775e1c2-6511-4c62-9589-5f8f9fb8783e.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"bfc5b6a7-6f26-4a98-94a0-44b99094ca24.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"63b27bd1-0145-4d08-bad9-a0711f01d62e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"e7283342-8c76-4590-94c9-53a7808ea2b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"ae1e69ad-61e3-445b-a872-2bb049095fe7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"ff430df9-5a95-4e25-be67-b75f6827171a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"a292c6a1-f74a-46d6-9990-c4c7a712b761.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"56d29c63-46ac-48ba-b03f-673d0012b2bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":25964,"FileName":"af7e5860-5766-4d0c-835b-06fb3a0cc7f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10503,"Name":"Centipede","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"GET OUT YOUR BUG BLASTER AND SAVE THAT FUNGUS!\n\nTHE THRILL OF THE ARCADE GAME\n\nAn insidious invasion of multiplying insects (centipedes, jumping spiders, poisonous scorpions, and frenzied fleas) pose different perils to the mushroom patch.

Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet \"x\"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game. In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete \"lap\". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.\n\nIn addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is \"SPECIAL\" and the yellow word is \"EXTRA\". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.\n\nHearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj6XPHpx0KY","Platform":"Mattel Intellivision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","Publisher":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1983-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"09169041-fc53-4bb2-ac8e-ec398aa50aec.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"956a0bc3-4fad-4d84-b6ed-72c44b096ba1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"5018c6f3-c0cd-40c9-9be3-68d26a4fe927.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"45020d3f-52f3-4032-82ed-269ae0600afe.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"e4f5fca8-7c5e-484a-b1dc-142b1d819521.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"ece33bd2-ae94-472a-83db-994a08bf7a98.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"9df64ab8-d214-4807-88b5-60d32f74b7c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"ef322c40-5dd9-4036-a043-d0bbd01a4924.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"e9d049ea-f78d-4162-9f69-968de56210f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"6c1afe44-25bb-407e-b381-ee07096e4ba4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"8c853168-551b-470f-8907-d659b5a32b88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":111174,"FileName":"8f82faf7-54a7-4de8-9c7e-c23d701b6524.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":111576,"Name":"Land Battle","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"[Unreleased 1982]  Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both strategic and tactical modes of play.

You can shoot the cars if you like, but this will bring the Secret Police and their bullets.

A fleet of these large battlecraft are now heading towards your home planet, and it is your job to stop them! The game is played from a side scrolling overhead point of view as your small but agile spaceship flies past the dreadnaughts.

Your goal here is to fire a Bit-Gun at pairs of BIT streams and BIT stacks before they hit the top of the screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Mattel Intellivision","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mattel Electronics","Publisher":"Mattel Electronics","ReleaseDate":"1982-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"4c9833c2-a603-4967-b8f5-0621c8662686.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"06da1561-36b9-43f1-8d07-d4bca2c5c748.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"bebe0eed-4e6f-4860-a667-2452eebe9916.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"00f3a37b-2bce-41a7-be9a-ac73e75ece93.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"0fd350c1-5d62-4c72-bbe6-abd21f46f4f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"f6752f47-9498-4c92-85a2-744f19ec1209.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"04730220-ceec-4af5-adfd-dc43bdb65247.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"a230974e-f150-4eb8-8329-5c13c1d3f09f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4100,"FileName":"827062dc-fa80-4fbe-9958-47c33555fb88.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4101,"Name":"Tron: Solar Sailer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"TRON: Solar Sailer is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then is to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of \"energy bugs\" on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Mattel Intellivision","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mattel Electronics","Publisher":"Mattel Electronics","ReleaseDate":"1983-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"043b560a-f274-4571-853f-7fdd42266b5c.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"9f53d98c-1138-478f-b3b2-1188933257b7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"c19ce6a2-7b6c-4b50-a9c4-117becdd1a72.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"b5f062fb-dc67-4a58-b51d-ed395218443a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"e3c86204-0c53-417d-a693-736bfc85f3f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"50edce45-2e95-409f-9c21-50b426af9d1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"e20abb63-6f91-477e-a104-fd94cdef33a5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"7e2b711d-01a3-47d8-82ea-4a54d86d8ca8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4101,"FileName":"060aeeca-fe20-4756-9c01-be05fce6ce8e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":4102,"Name":"Tropical Trouble","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Clumsy Clarence is vacationing on a tropical island with his girlfriend Doris.

The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Mattel Intellivision","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Imagic","Publisher":"Imagic","ReleaseDate":"1983-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10559,"FileName":"bd056f99-81f8-420c-bf39-e075b8d92db4.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10559,"FileName":"80174e5e-9be1-4b88-9e3f-3868c93f59e4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10559,"FileName":"6474a3f0-21ed-4a15-b084-2bdfb16cc231.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10559,"FileName":"e548ecaf-3dc6-4f00-b6e7-2b29bc39d96e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10559,"FileName":"d8c2b657-07aa-4615-aadc-f2bb6513e75d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10559,"FileName":"43fd1385-3f4f-4e48-a3d1-fa937a2401d3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25967,"Name":"World Championship Baseball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An improved version of Major League Baseball.
