The player takes control of the eponymous lizard Repton who for each of the game's twelve levels has to collect all of its diamonds. At the same time he has to watch out for falling boulders and monsters that may roam around and try to kill him. The time is limited and when it runs out the player loses a life. A life is also lost when being caught by a monster or being crushed beneath a boulder. The main difference between Repton and Boulder Dash is that Repton is calmer and has a focus on puzzle solving rather than quick arcade action. Often there is only a specific route to take that the player must figure out or he risks being trapped between boulders. Some levels have eggs, safes and keys. When eggs fall they will crack and a reptile will emerge from it. The player should avoid the reptiles as he will lose a life if he comes into contact with them. Keys needs to be picked up to open the safes. Once opened a diamond will be revealed. The game uses a password system so the player can jump straight to the level he has the password for.","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"90353":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tim Tyler","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"7f95a767-ad08-4996-8f09-ec6f2f678f4b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"4c434bfb-b2e2-400a-a1c6-4924bce7677a.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c362740a-aac9-4c68-abf7-5e729deec7b1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"438e4f55-fcc9-4f6e-87e4-3bca3dfdbef4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"37e2a499-e87d-4902-87fa-fde6759681cb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"543de8e0-1468-4f71-a1c0-d2f58eda07d9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3cb174ff-dcc7-47ab-a28a-ba6b17b86aae.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0b4820e6-b545-41ce-b943-69f675a4e6f8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c8812efe-e109-4608-b3aa-9f7bf5bcc678.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Repton 2","Overview":"Repton 2 is, just like its predecessor, a puzzle solving game about collecting diamonds. It features a number of new features and changes from the original formula. The biggest change is that instead of separate levels it now features one big world where each sector is connected with teleporters. The basic gameplay is very similar though. The player digs his way through the dirt in search for diamonds and other objects and has to watch out for falling boulders or monsters (reptiles) that are out for him. Monsters appear from cracked eggs and will kill the player if he comes into contact with them. They can be killed with falling boulders. There are also spirits who follow the walls to their left until they reach a cage. In the cage the spirit transforms into a diamond. To get all the diamonds the player therefore has to guide all the spirits to their cages. The player can also collect jigsaw puzzle pieces. These will then appear at the first screen and form the sentence \"Repton 2 Is Ended\". On the topmost levels of the world the player has to watch out for meteors that fall from the sky.\n\nThe game involves more than just collecting diamonds. To complete the game the player has to do all of the following:\ncollect all of the 4,744 earth sections\ncollect all of the 1,634 diamonds\nkill all of the 18 monsters\nuse all of the 64 transporters\ncollect all of the 42 jigsaw puzzle pieces\ncollect a \"finish character\"\n\nUnlike the original game there is no time limit in Repton 2.

They were 14½ and 16 when they started coding the game in 1986. The equipment used to write it was a memory monitor chip, a monochrome 14\" TV, a cassette tape recorder and their own BASIC-written graphic-design software. The game was originally named Magelords, later to be named Spellbinder by Superior Software marketing team.\n\nUnusually, for a BBC Micro game, it featured continuous background music - a version of Midnight Summer Dream, the 1983 song from British rock group The Stranglers' album Feline.\n\nThe player has to navigate his way through the castle, collect ingredients and make spells that can be used on the various creatures that roam the castle. The player sees his character from a side view and uses the keyboard to navigate him between rooms and interact with the environment. The castle consists of two floors, three citadels, a catacomb and a dungeon and to move between the different levels teleports or portals have to be used. There are also secret passages, one-way doors and doors that only appear after certain tasks has been accomplished.\n\nTo create spells the player has to collect the various ingredients that can be found around the castle and then mix them together. Among the ingredients there are burned ashes that is used for spells that causes effects on enemies, sulphur that is used for curing wounds, toad's legs that are used for freezing spells and dried roots which is used on spells intended for the spellbinder. Example of spells include heal which is made by mixing sulphur and dried roots while freeze which slows down enemies is created by combining toad's legs and burned ashes. Regular spells doesn't kill enemies but can be used to avoid their bad effects.

The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him.\n\nThere are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten).

Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. There are 20 areas to be completed.\nOn the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.\nThere are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1E1Jy6gZuuY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bruce_Lee_%28video_game%29"},"90513":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Incentive Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"c5de2b84-5621-4047-8906-3814d052b385.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"27342498-c0fb-408c-9b94-9b1ad911df1e.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cbd088b6-e796-4ef2-af68-0f9752c48b76.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aff8bd64-2492-44a9-a970-6c9d30472249.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa2f5ed8-5d21-456f-ab80-5fc4a6e69f1c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"65719ae1-07ee-4917-aeb9-4247d04de894.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7df39558-0f91-4c3c-85f4-d7e9b6008ede.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0bc747d3-6c13-4736-ab99-3543ca43182b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c31a600d-1db1-4859-9ccb-956ad582249a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"a8a02f27-7537-49fc-96a3-77554cbe1183.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fd9acf2b-30e1-4c23-94c9-1bb8f59e642e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Confuzion","Overview":"Confuzion is a puzzle game developed and published by Incentive Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, and Acorn Electron.

It is the first in a trilogy of Micro Power games featuring the factory worker Felix and was followed by Felix and the Fruit Monsters (a Pac-Man style overhead maze game) and another factory-based platformer, Felix meets the Evil Weevils.\n\nThe object of the game is to keep the Generator, in the bottom right of the factory, filled with oil. If the level of oil, shown at the bottom of the screen, gets too low the lights will start to fail and eventually the Generator will stop.\nTo oil the Generator, you must guide Felix down the ladder, along the conveyor belt, jumping over the packages, up past the Gremlins to the oil can and then back to the Generator. To help you past the Gremlins, use the pitchfork which is hanging on the wall somewhere and run at the Gremlins. You should be able to knock them off the conveyors.\nAnother hazard of the factory is the Rat. This will run across a level from time to time. A bag of rat poison is provided to help you reduce the rodent population and you can leave this on any level that you wish.\nYou can only carry one object at a time and once you have the oil can, you cannot drop it again.\nIf you trip over the packages on the conveyor belt you will be given a chance to get up again but if you reach the edge of the screen, you will lose a life.","Publisher":"Micro Power Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r5vgPxhicH4"},"90552":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"David Acton","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"f1093f4b-35bc-497a-b0a9-f1dd968140af.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"94096435-fa6d-47ea-8f4a-f0439d11a2b2.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fe331823-878b-4a0a-94c2-9abea8c1f646.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ee6660da-9a51-4d1d-b782-44d4e7596209.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cd20f961-54f9-48ee-a02c-09de2ab785b1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc6b90c9-8f10-49cf-96c9-5367748520d5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"52013744-1187-4ac1-b5d2-63fb9bd1adde.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b24da33d-938b-4569-85ec-f54b6db1b494.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"0f8f06d4-6171-4a2e-8805-a92c43cb4119.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c3be7ceb-6eb5-4906-a1d4-f1a7b043254b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Repton Infinity","Overview":"Repton Infinity was released in 1988, by which time the BBC Micro's popularity as a games platform was beginning to wane.

However, Exile probably marked the end of large-scale development for the BBC, and there were no big projects after it.","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2sRFxCf5pIE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exile_(1988_video_game)"},"90603":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Geoff Crammond","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"39d8c072-61bb-4b9f-95f3-d1f316b090a0.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f4d614a8-cd33-48de-9508-80a0e8c223c0.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9041762-c570-4a12-9c5f-65d2189fdf85.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36c9b4a0-14f8-4b4a-a2c4-2bf34e1128cd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e05f0fcf-1da7-463f-91c7-cdc0cc587305.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3a1e19d3-b673-4d6a-a6be-a5d7fad47f14.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"46d8d3c5-8487-4526-bd7e-1c433a307b3e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6df056a1-7168-4460-a36c-f4d6d5f7d186.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"61da9394-2871-40b1-8c2a-42f704fd559e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aviator","Overview":"Aviator was programmed by Geoff Crammond.\n\nAlthough it displayed in only black and white (a four colours version was also released) and had few of the features of modern simulators for more powerful computers, Aviator was of unparalleled quality at the time of its release, with a realistic flight model that included g-forces that could tear the wings off in a dive.\n\nThe landscape was crudely rendered, and was basically a plane. Some scenic features were drawn as vector graphics, including low hills, fields, a lake, a suspension bridge over a river, and a small town which comprised a cluster of three buildings.\n\nBonus points could be earned for flying under the bridge or along the main street of the town at a lower altitude than the buildings. Double points were earned for performing these stunts upside down.\n\nThe game also had a shoot-'em-up mode in which alien vessels were seeded in the fields,feeding on the crops and growing until they could become airborne, at which point they headed for the town. The player could destroy the aliens on the ground as they fed, or (for reduced points) tackle them in the air (the aliens were agile but could not return fire).

At the time, it was a highly acclaimed Acornsoft release, with its high resolution graphics, addictive gameplay and fluid animation.\n\nIn 1987 the game was reissued on Superior Software's Acornsoft Hits compilation.\n\n\n\nLabyrinth is a scrolling 2D shoot 'em up, consisting of a complex labyrinth made up of multiple levels. Each level is made up of a number of rooms, with the player only able to see a single room at any one time. Doorways are provided allowing the player to move between rooms.\n\n\n\nEach level contains two special rooms, the 'Gate Room', and the 'Key Room'. The Gate Room contains an impenetrable gate, beyond which lies the next level. The Key Room contains a jewel which will open the gate, and is generally the most well-guarded and dangerous room in the level.\n\n\n\nRooms are populated with a variety of monsters, which become more and more dangerous as the player progresses through the game. The player is able to shoot or avoid the various monsters, as well as squash them with a \"boulder\" that the player is able to push around with them as they travel. Colliding with a monster will cause the player to lose health, often leading to the player's death.\n\n\n\nDifferent types of fruit are scattered throughout the labyrinth, which will increase the player's health when eaten. The player slowly, but consistently, loses health at all times while in the Labyrinth, and will eventually die without eating fruit.","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"90647":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ultimate Play The Game","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3b2999cf-81fe-48e5-af96-298341ac222f.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b38bd3e1-74d9-43f8-a9f4-067d134e2768.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bbb5a33c-8dbb-4523-943c-a398618023e2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a52686d2-f1cf-4dd2-96f6-08c4a0142d49.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"260bd8ba-dd05-4e2b-9ea3-43074944d409.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"4aacab4f-b32a-4767-add5-88b05982ce24.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fffb70e2-1f9a-48c4-b5d7-685c48bbf517.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Atic Atac","Overview":"Atic Atac is an arcade-adventure video game developed and published by Ultimate Play The Game, released for the ZX Spectrum and the BBC Micro in 1983.

It is a platform game featuring puzzles.\n\n\n\nThe game features sixteen levels which are played in a random order. To complete a level, Imogen needs to obtain a spell fragment which will warp him to the next level or, after all sixteen have been collected and the spell completed, to the outside world, thus completing the game. The spell fragments are always placed somewhere inaccessible at the outset of the level, and obtaining the spell fragments requires some lateral thinking on behalf of the player.\n\nImogen himself is able to transform into three different forms, each with an ability unavailable to the other two.\n\nEach level (consisting of a sealed cavern 4 screens in size) requires transforming back and forth between the forms to complete it. While it is impossible for the player to actually die during the game, the number of transformations is limited to 150, and using them all before the game is complete renders it unwinnable.","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"90653":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Adrian Stephens","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"0317b057-5166-4819-83fc-8ff566025b71.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d192f701-83ad-4c93-bc7d-832bf8e75f31.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a1b711d5-1285-4f8a-8ba7-ab84b6b2cf39.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5eda575f-379a-42ce-b489-995b89b85254.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b2a97f5-92d5-4814-9478-672f095a3a7b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f56604e5-6bcb-4562-942f-32cbfe40a782.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"099640eb-b3b9-4622-b421-9700ef9fd508.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fde4fe7f-63fd-4f3c-a78e-77df94e776c6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cf6a8d5b-6119-49b7-b817-209bb67281d6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"449b2134-8d3e-4bd2-b460-1f7119885a9f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4a75fa33-af5f-45df-a5d5-ba1eb2a83409.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Killer Gorilla","Overview":"Killer Gorilla is a clone of Donkey Kong written by Adrian Stephens and originally published by Micro Power for the BBC Microcomputer in 1983 and ported to the Acorn Electron and Amstrad CPC computers in 1984.\n\n\n\nStephens wrote Killer Gorilla at the age of 17 after buying a magazine that had screenshots of Donkey Kong, and that made him feel like doing something similar.

The Doctor can jump, climb ladders, push buttons, and throw or use items.\n\nHe is accompanied by a robotic female cat named Splinx (who may remind you of the more famous K9 robot dog). The Doctor can only carry four items in his pockets, so Splinx is a valuable ally for fetching and carrying additional items. Even large items can fit in her dimensionally transcendental hyperspace load module. Splinx can also avoid proximity sensors and other creatures along with any items she carries. Occasionally, her energizer cells have to be recharged at external power points and the Doctor can place location markers to which she can find her way back to. Along the way, you will meet local peaceful Rijans who can be asked to perform simple tasks, and Cryostan plants which are used to make super-coolant fluid.

The player controls his space ship along the bottom of the screen and has to shoot at the aliens that move around above him. The enemies fly in formations and will either try to shoot or collide with the player's ship. Once all of the aliens have been killed the player moves on to the next level. After every few levels there is a challenge stage where the enemies fly past in a certain pattern and the player has to shoot down as many as possible. Some ships can trap the player's ship with a tractor beam. The player can then recapture it by destroying the ship that captured it and thereby get two ships at once with twice the fire power.\n\nZalaga can be played by one or two players with either keyboard or joystick. An operator mode allows the player to customize some of the settings, such as start screen, automatic fire and reload speed.","Publisher":"Alternative Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YqQ0UqDvo8A"},"91323":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ian Collinson","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e0b2d6e8-1f2a-4a68-9420-392c25f5a69a.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d5a3b757-e379-4f57-8f08-4a77ab49e64f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f87316f-b6d7-495f-b173-f004285e3cd3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f0804a8b-4813-4dd3-b3d5-586aa27b7386.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4cefb6e-681b-46fe-8574-e1f41246d6b2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fca6c673-b95a-4060-8df3-edf1fe873471.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3962a9eb-6bb1-4c43-9501-7222858ae246.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"68e40251-61fb-4b14-a68e-604d3aa5ce43.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ac18c62d-277b-4fce-9bfe-65a8918b9931.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"282576cf-5e5e-4449-8266-8da877daeca6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Zenon","Overview":"Zenon is a video game developed by Ian Collinson and published for the BBC Microcomputer by Impact Software.\n\nIt's a side-scrolling shooter comprising of 250 levels. \nYou have 4 lives to complete each of the levels which are approximately 10 times the length of the screen.\nTo complete a level, you must generally keep moving to the right whilst avoiding and shooting such aliens, fireballs and meteorites.\nThe game can be played by one player or two players together.\n\nAt the start of each level, you will be beamed down to the surface of Zenon.

You as the people's champion have been chosen to get their WOKS back.\nThere are nine rooms containing the Woks, unfortunately some rooms have more guards than others; the first three have only one guard in each, the next three have two in each, the last three rooms have three guards in each. The only advantage you have is that the guards are highly disciplined and never change the route of their patrol. You must learn the routes if you are to have any chance of defeating them.\nThe Woks have been evenly distributed about the rooms, eight in each. Once you have collected all the Woks you then must get the key to open the exit door to the next room.\nYou have a limited time in each room indicated by the counting down bonus score. If the bonus reaches zero you lose a life. Remember that you only have four lives - you can't afford to waste any.\nIf by some miracle you manage to clear all nine rooms, you are returned to the first one to begin your quest.

This version of the game offers three different difficulties with the harder ones offering some additional gameplay features. The easier one, A Mild Encounter, plays like traditional Space Invaders. In the Uncomfortable Situation difficulty the UFO, when it survives without being shot, produces a force shield that guides the aliens and hastens their speed. The hard mode is called A Terrifying Experience and here the alien projectiles have a homing capability and follow the player. There are three different kinds of aliens and they are scored depending on how far from the player they are. The player has three lives and an extra is earned after 5000 and 15000 points.","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AmOd33jXqWM"},"101980":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Astral Software","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"196cc937-805d-4059-aaa4-184d1689e511.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4029dc9e-3786-4c49-ab5c-c1141a61a019.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d1e4794b-22ef-40d7-82b9-66aadec16c37.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c9a73408-b40f-4b83-8650-2b1455ec7fbc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"880e7c35-b2ba-4ac8-ab47-f1e36ebd2eb7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0ce390ac-af77-44a2-9b8a-5fae2e0c87e7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"18e90284-fc26-4ae2-9b3b-de7da4721353.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8c7ed61f-e6bb-4c06-a22f-d91f2a69210e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"86dedeba-7a3a-4bb5-b5ad-f654949668c7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"63551f4c-8d95-4ea2-9428-37858cbffd37.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"XOR","Overview":"The player controls two shields, Magus and Questor, which can be moved horizontally and vertically though the maze, in order to collect masks.

The player will also die if all acid drops out. There are three different enemies; moths, pods and spinners. Initially there are only moths but if they are hit by acid they will mutate into pods which in turn will become spinners when hit.

The gate opens with time which will speed up when an enemy is hit.

It has a first person point of view and features ten thousand playfields. It's uniqueness caused it to be labelled \"the first virtual reality game\".\n\nThe idea of the game is to manipulate an artificial landscape so that you are higher than the Sentinel and can then vaporise him.\nYou do this by raising land, absorbing energy, teleporting, etc. What makes this seemingly easy task difficult is that you have to avoid the gaze of the Sentinel's drones. They occupy different points on the landscape. If you are caught in their gaze, you need to move fast or be destroyed.","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Sentinel_(video_game)"},"111709":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Aardvark Software","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"fa501b90-679a-456c-9a5d-c2104504eb76.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"691f695d-117c-4763-a375-473d15c4c7e0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a65740bc-9afe-4a3f-896a-9e303e95415f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6faf784-cf50-4762-a510-2787ba84398a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ae2b1e35-b855-461a-84e1-a5c9e650e755.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9d434605-b344-48a1-9fc0-2addee0f8da9.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9e90d97e-5d22-4499-865a-61085bc81409.PNG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"65e65bf7-86ce-40f8-b792-2bf88988e11f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"3D Pool","Overview":"3D Pool for the BBC Microcomputer was programmed by Nick Pelling (Orlando).\n\nIt is known as 3D Pool on the box cover and as Maltese Joe Barbara's 3D Pool in the game's title screen.\n\nIt is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead).

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players.\nGame A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","Publisher":"Audiogenic Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"116516":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visions","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f8332516-c664-4040-919c-7728721fe8ff.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2ad97a61-85b2-40df-b6c1-df9c7ac2179f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b1706c2c-5a57-4346-b05e-97acd8a42989.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nifty Lifty","Overview":"Nifty Lifty is a simple arcade game.

The larger ships have cloaking devices which make them invisible. Damage is inflicted on ships when they are shot or rammed by other ships. Uniquely for the time, the player vessel remains locked in the centre of the screen and the world rotates and moves around it. Player shots also have limited range and are subject to the same rotation as everything else, which means the player needs to predict where shots will need to go in order to hit the enemies. The ship has both long range scanners and shields but may only use one at a time. By default, the game will automatically switch between them based on the proximity of enemy vessels but the player can optionally take full control. Using shields, thrusting, turning and firing all use up energy which is also depleted when hit by enemies. Energy will automatically replenish, most quickly if the shields are off and the starship is not moving but obviously this leaves the player open to attack.","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Starship_Command"},"122701":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Fourth Dimension","Genres":"Strategy; Vehicle Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"acd01083-8307-4d95-a7f6-c6b21e1f932b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"250a8f4b-9288-4750-953f-06f129db496b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"58403f47-04f0-4a4d-b475-08a05dccdd8a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a2f614c-4476-42c3-894b-ae2e29a9d46c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7f912488-2fba-4483-a413-f5f1800c3d3d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"eb482c61-ef7a-4eda-abeb-2979be7b24bb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2fbebc56-3ad4-4319-a691-eb2066778f3e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ed1d76d2-6837-4a92-9125-74477ae5de66.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"91e67812-7fcc-4667-9039-da6b2b572ebb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2d0920d9-92d2-41ae-b54a-865b677f8299.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b3cff665-78dc-4919-890b-abbbd36b5d6d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"UIM: Ultra Intelligent Machine","Overview":"UIM is a 3D arcade adventure, an underwater version of Elite, set in a future where all life exists in the oceans.\nYou travel the oceans in a submarine, trading in commodities, shares and currency, and seeking the UIM.\nYou will need to purchase system and weapon upgrades to combat hostile forces.\nThere are over 65000 underwater ports with their own colonies to visit and over 250 missions to complete before you finally encounter the UIM.","Publisher":"The Fourth Dimension","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"122921":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Anco Software Ltd.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"772da12c-3065-46cc-9326-10fd3b638ec0.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fc50fdfd-6796-4a1f-bbd0-3f145b7cfd9f.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f2ebba2c-6c14-4f85-a0fb-d8cbdedb53d4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92a9ea65-80fe-4dc0-8ee6-69ea239de0ad.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5af06fb6-45f2-4aaa-af01-3a9aece59c60.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8634170-a80f-4ab2-8800-4891ac5aae48.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f904f5a-d79e-49cf-8a21-f9bb7230b7e8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6ba4be3e-e354-47d4-8279-fcbb9c40fde7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fd039000-29cf-4a68-bfa3-7b9f00f9c81a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"35a2110b-8b7b-4b9e-aa38-c59d3c122391.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Strip Poker II Plus","Overview":"Anco released their own sequel to Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance using a different interface and girls to Artworx's own sequel.

It's modelled very generally on the original Crowther and Woods' Colossal Caves. You'll meet some familiar characters in it, though, to be fair, it is nothing like Colossal Caves and is a very worthy adventure in its own right.\n\nYour task is to search an underground complex to add yet more treasures to the pile you have built up from previous adventures. You start your quest on a well-trodden road and a quick search of the countryside should find you equipped for the start of your quest. Then it's off to the Valley of Doom and down the Hall of Spirits for the start of your perils. You'll soon come across a pirate and a dwarf who will leave you an axe.\n\nYour first major problem is likely to be in getting past the fiery passage - this is where you find out whether you have the bottle for this adventure! Later you'll need to escape from a sea-serpent - match that if you can! The troll shouldn't prove to be much of a problem. You should be able to discover where he puts his loot. Right! That's enough clues!\n\nOne thing I couldn't discover was whether there was any meaning to the graffiti in the Inner Sanctum. I'm sure that there are more locations to be discovered here. Please let me know if you have figured it out.\n\nI've managed to map more than 100 locations so it is a big adventure. In fact I must confess that it is one of those games that keeps you up until the small hours. Five o' clock in my case.\n\nOverall, an extremely good adventure and one that I can wholeheartedly recommend. Let's hope Acornsoft do conversions for their other adventures.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".\n\nThe game can be played using keyboard and\/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.","Publisher":"Empire Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"124306":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Catalyst Coders","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ca1843cf-758d-4d11-a52e-bf7808fbd30b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"31f26bb5-8d60-4d8d-891d-2e0a08e0e43f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7eaa9ef4-b8d1-4c8a-84e1-9701d18df59b.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0861ed23-d90b-4c87-977c-d85d8d647ce6.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f957cd1d-3957-45d8-8e2f-70ce7595e010.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gyroscope","Overview":"A game similar to Marble Madness.

The game became so popular that Acornsoft released a version for the BBC Micro home computer.\n\n\n\nThe board displayed on the screen contains rows of 'Drogna' in five different shapes and colours. At the top and bottom of the board are the players' home bases and at each side are the vaults, each of which contains three diamonds.\n\nThe game always starts with the red player having a half-turn. After that, each player has a full turn, and the current player is indicated by his man moving his head from side to side on the screen.\n\nThe aim of the game is for each player to score points by collecting diamonds from the two vaults and depositing them in his own home base. Once a diamond has been removed from a vault it cannot be replaced and it retains its value until the end of the game.\n\nA diamond can be classed as being in one of three different states - either swag, loot or dump. While a diamond is still in a vault or on a drogna it is referred to as loot and can be picked up by either player. After it has been picked up and is being carried around, it is referred to as swag and the player holding it has the value of it displayed in the box at his home base labelled swag. If a player manages to deposit a diamond at his home base the diamond is referred to as dump and again its value is displayed at his home base, this time in the box labelled dump.\n\nThe player who owns a dump does not gain the score for it until another swag is dropped on top of it. Until this happens the dump can be stolen by his opponent, although the player who placed the dump in his home base is not allowed to remove it again from there. The game ends when one of the players manages to score 900 points.","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"124437":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Gorf"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Matthew Waltham","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5a7e34aa-afcf-4ba5-9d81-19c79ba0fca5.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b1f61ec0-7a93-4540-ba83-ad0a7c611dfb.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bf3113ca-0bdc-466b-9aee-b88588d3a73e.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"270ca3da-7ad1-4c9f-8e51-ea5dccc0c9c3.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73cec65e-a1a0-4cf6-815e-b5fb9b3475a6.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b6e00f27-e857-4167-9442-bc2a50eabda2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d0a2a195-ae36-4478-9223-74911a5a884a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gorph","Overview":"Gorf was ported from the arcades to a number of home computers and consoles.

Vital buildings can be located using colour-coded co-ordinates, but these change every time you load the game, so be careful to write them down.","Publisher":"Level 9 Computing","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"124701":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Melvyn Wright","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"3d234568-193f-4987-a82a-20a9963954ac.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5493d432-7786-4fba-add4-0b772dcbf119.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a5a9b26-b4a0-4eca-9140-38eff474582f.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"66031814-d577-412f-bb73-55e73fdd3061.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3519f3df-530b-4b39-a1d6-2657d142a2cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"3D Convoy","Overview":"You have to launch torpedoes at the ships in an enemy convoy.

There are seven variations on the standard game, including progressive walls and captive balls.\n\nDodgems: Your racing car has to outwit the computerised car, which is programmed to crash into you. You have the advantage of acceleration, but must keep switching lanes to avoid a head-on collision.\n\nSnake: Guide the hungry snake towards its prey, and watch it grow as it consumes different kinds of food.

The player has a top down view of the the circuit board, with the CPU in the middle and data lines going outwards from it. The enemies will follow these lines till they reach the CPU and the player's task is to stop them by shooting out electrical pulses down the data lines. If any of the enemies reach the CPU it will explode and the player will lose a life. At times different tools such as hammers and pliers appear briefly and shooting these will give some bonus points.

A magic carpet with a rope ladder attached to it as well as a number of enemies are moving all around the screen. Sinbad converts the enemies by touching them but to be able to reach them he has to jump up and climb the ladder. However after they have been converted making contact with them again will lead to Sinbad falling off the ladder which makes it increasingly harder to reach the remaining enemies.\n\nWhen all enemies have been converted the game moves on to the second stage where Sinbad sits on the magic carpet and flies through space. This stage is played from a behind the back view of Sinbad and the task is to fly past the numerous asteroids that appear without getting hit.

At the bottom of the screen is a river where fish swim in lines from left to right. Fish are caught by positioning the osprey at the right height and pressing the fire button to make it dive.

The time is limited and if the fish is not delivered within twenty seconds a chick will die. Additionally there is a poacher that occasionally climbs the tree in an attempt to steal a chick.

Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.\n\nThe port for C16 and Plus\/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WJoe63vFW3c","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beach_Head_%28video_game%29"},"134468":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"First Star Software","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ce160a17-1190-40e6-8b3b-f25e479dffd3.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2d5c2c7a-531e-4b33-9c2c-f1af7c087490.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9cb0d1ad-db9f-49d4-b63e-9513fc58b61f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce082749-e026-4b6b-84f7-510791bbfdd6.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9e7e23e4-fa83-4fe9-87cd-5d8fef7e31f4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0429b312-0366-4574-bbd8-c0cb601f4e7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2ee045d3-201b-4170-8224-31dfa377e098.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Spy vs Spy","Overview":"MAD magazine’s comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players.

The aim is to visit each cube so that its top surface changes colour.

If they catch you one of your three lives is lost. Escape is provided by two elevators which return you to the surface.\nIf Boris or Coily try to follow, they vanish for a few seconds. This gives you a chance to escape, and gain some bonus points. Erbert can also collect a Rota Hat which allows you limited flight with two extra keys required to manage the flying skills. Elevators and Rota Hats can only be used once.\nTo add to the problems, boulders roll down the cubes. In higher skill levels some of the cubes turn into vaporisers. These have a drastic effect on your life expectancy but fortunately they don't last long. Also at the higher levels, Erbert cannot manage to paint the cubes at the first attempt. You have to apply the undercoat on the first visit and a second trip is required to put on the top coat.\nTo score high points you can make Erbert pick up Boris's banana. This also causes Boris to lose his temper, but you can drop the banana with a quick press of Space.\nIf Erbert manages to recolour all his cubes you move to a new and more complicated screen.","Publisher":"Alternative Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nTZdm8mKiaw"},"134692":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pace","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9fa6154d-b32d-497c-a04f-0ed687258787.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1fa6e81d-255c-4ed7-9a77-2ae011abcbde.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"441b1583-5753-47b9-90df-b201f60f8e34.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"96ebd23d-0fad-4c3e-90cd-68a95fa146a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"512c32de-6d72-4298-86bb-9a53267bfb74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c7e65d32-505b-4858-9a2c-8c452215304e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ed88ebc3-83c6-493b-8298-3a89c2f887c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Skyhawk","Overview":"In this chop-lifter type game you fly a helicopter over enemy defended terrain.

In level one, you are required to bring back each ingredient (cheese, beef patty, and sausage) separately on each of the three trays provided. The player must avoid the 'moving manholes' which will take away the tray or ingredient that they are carrying.\n\nOnce you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la Burger Time. The object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen.\n\nWhen the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next level.

Players command an aircraft through different environments, shooting down planes to collect points. The ship's nose can be rotated left or right, so the craft can move into any direction and take sharp turns left or right. Speed is not controlled by the user and it is always maintained at the same level automatically. The background is wrapped endlessly both horizontally and vertically, and that way it is impossible to encounter a border. The game takes place in five time periods: 1916, 1940, 1970, 1984 and 1999. Each level holds different types of enemies, from classic biplanes to spitfires, helicopters, jets and UFOs.\n\nIn each scene the player needs to shoot eight regular planes to decrease an icon bar of planes in the top left corner. For every icon that disappears a sound is played and a new squadron arrives. Once all the icons are gone a large boss ship appears and it takes multiple hits to destroy it. After taking it out the plane travels through time to a new period. The player's aircraft has an unlimited amount of bullets. Enemy planes have bullets too, but some of them can also drop bombs or fire homing missiles. In certain environments paratroopers with a red cross appear; these can be collected for bonus points. There are four lives in total before the game is over, but for every 10,000 points a new life is granted. No more than five lives can be held. When all time periods have been completed, the cycle of the five scenes is restarted, but the score is kept.","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PEpMfa7Qp4A"},"153352":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"J Barfield","Genres":"Adventure; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"41d5d4c6-9b7a-4f41-97e3-1c1bea2b53f0.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c65fd3c5-14d4-46c0-bb9f-cc57f8dfe7b8.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"64a8ee43-b743-4899-a6f8-d974b503a6c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2091be1f-5b0f-4cbf-97ef-3298173f7cd2.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spacemaze","Overview":"The object is to find the Transmat while avoiding the lurking Froogs.

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.\n\nTwo game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. \n\nOne additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"157071":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"David Croft","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"78b7a725-0bcc-482c-b699-c0d9cff15967.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fa854361-d50f-4c51-9da7-0d3391c324eb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ec205bee-5c2d-4064-add6-1732f7ed02dc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8fb06d86-ea89-4e93-ac96-1fb42a5a10a7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"746080d3-e754-483a-b182-37607b351b39.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"df513500-2839-4103-a214-befaba648dcb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d16e2c0d-771d-4967-b0d3-b9cc8b3114a3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Winter Olympiad 88","Overview":"The game consists of six events from the Winter Olympics:  bob sled, speed skating, ski jump, giant slalom, ski slalom and biathlon.

Down the bottom of the screen are a number of columns and above these LEGO blocks (here called ogles) in various colours move back and forth. When starting out the right most column is filled with blocks and the player's task is to recreate this stack in the corresponding column on the left side of the screen. This is done by controlling a dog called Flash and picking up the right blocks and then dropping these in the right column. If a block is dropped in the wrong column it will automatically be dumped into a bin. Once the stack has fully been recreated the game moves on to the next level which features one extra stack to recreate.\n\nThere are two difficulty levels: one for younger persons and one for older persons. The difference lie in that the second level is played against a clock and features a scoring system. Each correctly placed block is worth ten points while a block dumped into the bin leads to twenty points being decreased. When completing a level ten time the number left on the clock is given in extra points.","Publisher":"Games Machine Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TkeTXVB7IkE"},"162028":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lyn Davis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"c9b87baf-a6c6-40ee-bb6e-f808d6fb7bd3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7c923b84-a346-40db-ac52-6a9f068e5516.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"458f79f2-e929-42ee-b91a-7dff419dc06f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Radium","Overview":"A horizontal space shooter written by Lyn Davis and  Published as a type-in in Electron User magazine volume 7, issue 9 in June 1990.\nAlso released on 5.25\" disk by EUG PD as part of the EUG#15 compilation for both the BBC and Electron computers.","Publisher":"Database Publications","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HiJnFlWp6a4"},"162040":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Charles Reilly","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"06ac1dcd-8b64-4f19-adf9-4886d63127d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"717a2bad-8359-4d12-b9fa-e489a345d7a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8eaaad8e-55ba-4656-8b6e-254d3f19a038.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BBC Tetris","Overview":"A well made Tetris clone written in 1991 by Charles Reilly.

You control a gun that moves along the bottom of the screen, firing shells at the tanks looping across a bridge at the top. The shells are relatively slow-moving so some aiming ahead is required. The tanks also return fire with similarly paced shots. Depending on where you hit the tanks, they may be destroyed or only damaged, and still able to return fire from a stationary position. \n\nEach wave has a set number of tanks to be blown up, with the number and speed increasing as the game progresses. You have 3 lives, and lose one when hit by an enemy shell or if you run out of ammo.","Publisher":"DK'Tronics Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e_Y0ReibpVo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/3D_Tanx"},"169391":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nick Pelling (aka.

Painter's gameplay is very similar to Amidar's bonus stages where the traditional boxes in the screen have points associated with. It can also be compared to Potty Painter in the Jungle which was one of the first Amidar variations for ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.\n\nPainter's main goal is to fill all the boxes in each frame in a certain period of time by completing the pathways (lines) around them. This must be done before the \"Bonus\" value reaches zero. To complicate things the \"Painter\" has to avoid any collision with the \"Chasers\", some entities present in the game that will try to intercept him and destroy his work. The \"Painter\" will be forced to restart the phase all over again and one of his lives will be lost in the process.\n\nTo defend himself during his gameplay and specially from the incredible speed the \"Chasers\" might get at the last skill factors of the game, the player has in his power a special tool: a gap creator. This weapon will create a temporary gap in the pathway lines preventing the \"Chasers\" from colliding with him. It can only be used three times at a time before any temporary gap is removed.\n\nThe limit of Painter's skill factor is 6. \"Chasers\" intelligence and speed will increase proportionally to the skill factor and dramatically at this point of the gaming. Prepare yourself to be ambushed.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zXbJSQD8HuA"},"169777":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Donkey Kong Jr."}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Adrian Stephens","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6943e3dd-bd08-47f3-bd0b-fb5b4052fa1a.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Donkey Kong Junior","Overview":"Mario has captured Donkey Kong and placed him in a cage.

Not for the faint of heart or slow of sword.\n\nThe game: Cells and Serpents is an adventure game set in an underground labyrinth of rooms.

His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\nPrince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.","Publisher":"Bitshifters Collective","ReleaseDate":"2018-03-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UA1Ne-EPUJ4"},"180615":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Peter Azzopardi","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"cdffbe7d-c5a4-4f68-897d-d28d64369c1f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"78d2790b-1ac8-41df-a9bc-31770cd12a4f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4821549e-22cd-4a57-b54b-cba6ba498ba4.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f24629bb-954a-4e84-a86c-d5046a2f40b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1fe54ebd-3fca-42a1-bb99-7e134f0f8937.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Ghouls of Azzod","Overview":"The Ghouls of Azzod is a Manic Miner inspired platformer developed by Peter Azzopardi and published by Database Publications in Micro User Magazine vol.4 issue 2 in April 1986.","Publisher":"Database Publications","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6sqkjNp4yY4"},"186456":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e4b95004-9e23-4cb1-aa91-9693616eaca0.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2782de00-458e-4479-86e3-0895d7fb8c2c.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Diamond Mine II","Publisher":"Blue Ribbon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"190274":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John Cassar","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"fe322adf-9796-46b1-9719-0bbaecf919b3.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d66eddb2-461b-4af3-a8ad-0f6616409ccb.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0abbf20b-47de-45d6-a81d-2b4f2fa26eb6.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8ea0eb6c-8ad3-4b9d-a295-f00c86ff78e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ca002d52-9b9e-46ba-80ed-be3a437c5a08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cred Breaks Out","Overview":"A top down maze game with the goal of rescuing survivors and leading them to the safety of your spaceship.\nWhen each level begins, you see five characters trapped in a room somewhere in the maze.

You can drop a card in front of you at any time and it serves as a barrier to anything in the maze that moves, including you and your companions. The cards will protect you from the nasties for about ten seconds; after this they disappear.\nOnce you open the door the people attach to you. Lead them to safety, avoiding the nasties and using a cunning combination of card blocking and last minute changes in route planning.\nIf the nasties touch one of your followers the chain breaks and they scuttle off in all directions. You therefore need to go and track them down in the maze, again avoiding all the nasties and waiting for the appropriate bleep to signify that they are following you again. All the time the oxygen bar at top right runs down.\nThe layouts of each maze grow in intricacy as the game progresses.\n\nRumour had it that the game was originally written for TSB for young savers to play in branches whilst their parents did their banking!","Publisher":"TSB The Micro Club","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"192888":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Forest of Evil"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Steve W.
