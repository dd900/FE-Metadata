Missile numbers increase and then split into multi war-heads until the inevitable happens and your capital city is destroyed by the final mushroom.\n\nGet straight back into your craft and see if you can hold out any longer in the next game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Steve Evans","Publisher":"Alligata Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125841,"FileName":"75843ff1-137b-4e5a-a437-d01475039899.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125841,"FileName":"f1efaea7-6a7f-4ae3-ae53-eb3193713b7a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125841,"FileName":"b4b893c5-7400-4e9b-a531-6eadb6e558f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125841,"FileName":"e1c34099-ebbd-41a1-af88-4372f7865115.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124708,"Name":"Abyss","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In this game you play the role of an adventurer who must make his way across the perilous abyss which many others before him have failed to do.

The player will also die if all acid drops out. There are three different enemies; moths, pods and spinners. Initially there are only moths but if they are hit by acid they will mutate into pods which in turn will become spinners when hit. Spinners require two hits to kill.\n\nThe objective of a level is to escape through a gate that is located on the right side of the screen. The gate opens with time which will speed up when an enemy is hit. When the gate is fully opened the game moves on to a second stage where the player has to move through a side scrolling tunnel without crashing. If a crash occurs the player still moves on to the next level but without a point bonus.

There are seven variations on the standard game, including progressive walls and captive balls.\n\nDodgems: Your racing car has to outwit the computerised car, which is programmed to crash into you. You have the advantage of acceleration, but must keep switching lanes to avoid a head-on collision.\n\nSnake: Guide the hungry snake towards its prey, and watch it grow as it consumes different kinds of food.

Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.\n\nThe port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoe63vFW3c","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Access Software, Inc.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"2a3e1184-1d41-473f-989c-5b551d0f0d77.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"88d50fe9-d71f-40cf-8d86-d6ede00f8405.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"3ff5f800-09fe-47d3-a599-ba72b6e6fa07.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"295b5e97-b1b9-481d-856d-7645d32b5f19.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"1db7446b-131c-4fee-b67f-9537f1ef156e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"30f9bfa9-67ea-4c73-8e54-f5d2594d6172.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"d206dca9-67a6-4394-ae67-b896f05f162b.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"539eb0ba-68cb-4d98-8acd-0fb66214c52f.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"7cabd16e-0b6a-4998-919f-c73c5d71c3d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"477e9907-c7ba-48de-b519-082e817cadc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132820,"FileName":"abb26943-291b-4a64-a904-1c3f0d43b053.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":152926,"Name":"Beebtote","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Up to six players can start the game and, after entering the names of the players and a minimum bet level, you must choose the number of meetings that the game will be played over.

In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.\nThere are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"First Star Software","Publisher":"Tynesoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"380f4b83-6250-425e-8421-374f6b5cb45b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"567ed8ea-a8c2-4ff1-8e87-5e22697b6a3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"db34f58e-c500-4ffd-a61c-0f21b6dddb25.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"bafcd8f0-74ea-4f74-8837-83e21d0f6a1a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"a8dd45dc-89e6-4e34-9f34-793d75da6d50.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"10e09035-32a5-47a1-af0d-27ee7df7f8d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"428d46eb-1aee-482d-9ceb-f0eb202903f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91192,"FileName":"4b20550c-d937-4d08-97d3-aacc3d8340a3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95716,"Name":"Bouncer","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Bouncer is a QBert clone developed and published by Acornsoft for the BBC Microcomputer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95716,"FileName":"e880875a-9048-4455-acfd-c7fbe8c67295.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":95716,"FileName":"00b3853c-7c2a-43f3-944c-23cebd3590e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95716,"FileName":"4857e944-847a-4783-a672-60b728420151.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95716,"FileName":"368deedd-32f1-4362-9eec-c867d94c5fa8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":95716,"FileName":"c51053c0-567f-4507-b9b2-695c9dc9c8d9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177686,"Name":"Bouncing Bill","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Oak Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177686,"FileName":"af39aa59-8328-4a56-ab27-4c59d640a8ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177686,"FileName":"37681c4c-9007-4921-91a8-4241c3c871ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91190,"Name":"Bounty Bob Strikes Back","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and features similar gameplay.

Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. There are 20 areas to be completed.\nOn the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.\nThere are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E1Jy6gZuuY","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Datasoft, Inc.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"61883c0f-e25f-48d0-974c-7edf4cb24cf0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"fe3461d9-13a1-4b60-b7f6-c94615070e4b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"29c730e6-168a-4f95-9574-5bfdd7184a4e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"0504cd2d-f0b0-4d0a-a3c2-4c2455eadf4a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"3c05e19c-b1ca-4cba-93a7-8a286f57e587.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"9396e1f5-32e5-4dee-b301-931047f1db19.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"a7128506-a0b7-4e0d-8a63-2da2c6a1beda.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"b42f7fdc-fd22-4c9e-8119-a83331d2460a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"a60f3952-2088-4e74-8425-66609df7eae3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"8afcb9d8-0c7e-48c7-8129-000e78802d90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"8c4687bc-b3dd-41f9-b7b4-aa48942c297f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90512,"FileName":"5e4149c2-69c6-4c2f-83ca-48386e5c6a9b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125629,"Name":"Bubble Bobble","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen.

The game was written by Peter Killworth and was one of a series of text adventures written for, or ported to the BBC Micro by the same author (others including Countdown to Doom and Philosopher's Quest). As with all such games, only text is used. The player must use a simple 'verb-noun' format (e.g. 'Go North', 'Get lamp') to control the game. Unlike Killworth's other Acornsoft adventures, Castle of Riddles was not updated and reissued by Topologika so became unavailable after 1985 when Acorn Computers (parent company of Acornsoft) pulled out of the games publishing market. Some of the puzzles however were included in the Topologika version of Philosopher's Quest.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123143,"FileName":"e064f670-a14d-46b2-8b43-2b071105f928.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":123143,"FileName":"7f402504-463f-412f-a8c6-0729c3506149.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":123143,"FileName":"5740d08e-0293-466a-ad80-8946d5a10657.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":123143,"FileName":"019f5a83-a38c-4a85-b4be-43b58cb38408.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123143,"FileName":"50c6b581-6b8b-4d42-b3b9-a3fb4330398d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90614,"Name":"Castle Quest","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Castle Quest was programmed in machine code by Tony Sothcott and published by Micro Power.

Following a nuclear war, humanity is trapped underground by a robot defence system that rules the irradiated surface. Your character assumes control of a robot drone, transmitting to a terminal below ground, and is given the task of freeing the trapped humans.\n\nThe player's first task is to explore the city and take over stronger robots in order to complete the mission. Gameplay consists of movement around a virtual 3D world, taking over other robots by shooting them until 'paralysed', running into them and entering a password to gain access.\n\nEach robot has different properties. \"Aviata\" is an aircraft who can fly, and transport other robots; \"Igor\" is a hacker who can access computer systems. The player can only control one robot at a time. All robots have four slots for 'rampacks' which are essentially files, either text files or programs which add extra functionality to your robot. The gameplay often involves swapping between robots in order to complete a certain task.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_xVR1LFVmQ","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":"Solid Image","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90380,"FileName":"10994769-e9f0-4626-80fe-b6fb26de455c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90380,"FileName":"fa228e65-a9e8-4b7c-9ac9-3d03dc91fb5b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90380,"FileName":"eb38803e-1d03-4249-89b8-28d2b0f560b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90380,"FileName":"bfff4b17-420c-456b-9b98-ed8baedb48b6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90380,"FileName":"bc3a3d36-8334-4a1c-9ba0-16722ec4b865.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90380,"FileName":"cdc8ed3d-cd70-493d-8736-6816f63ec513.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164275,"Name":"Christmas Crackers (1983 Edition)","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The 1983 Christmas Crackers is a compilation of 21 Christmas themed games.

However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.

The game was later re-released in 1987 by Topologika (who also published the game's sequels). This version was expanded by about 50% and as well as being released for the BBC and Electron (on disk only), the game was ported to many other systems including ZX Spectrum (+3 disk only), PC, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, Atari ST and RM Nimbus. It was also available for Acorn RISC OS computers as a compilation with Return to Doom and Philosopher's Quest.\n\nIn this game, the player's spaceship crash-lands on Doom's inhospitable surface and they emerge from the wreckage to realise that, unless they can locate the necessary spare parts, their ship will corrode away in a mere 400 time units.

If they catch you one of your three lives is lost. Escape is provided by two elevators which return you to the surface.\nIf Boris or Coily try to follow, they vanish for a few seconds. This gives you a chance to escape, and gain some bonus points. Erbert can also collect a Rota Hat which allows you limited flight with two extra keys required to manage the flying skills. Elevators and Rota Hats can only be used once.\nTo add to the problems, boulders roll down the cubes. In higher skill levels some of the cubes turn into vaporisers. These have a drastic effect on your life expectancy but fortunately they don't last long. Also at the higher levels, Erbert cannot manage to paint the cubes at the first attempt.

The first thing you need to do is to reach them and open the door. To assist you, you are carrying two TSB Trustcards. You can drop a card in front of you at any time and it serves as a barrier to anything in the maze that moves, including you and your companions. The cards will protect you from the nasties for about ten seconds; after this they disappear.\nOnce you open the door the people attach to you. Lead them to safety, avoiding the nasties and using a cunning combination of card blocking and last minute changes in route planning.\nIf the nasties touch one of your followers the chain breaks and they scuttle off in all directions. You therefore need to go and track them down in the maze, again avoiding all the nasties and waiting for the appropriate bleep to signify that they are following you again. All the time the oxygen bar at top right runs down.\nThe layouts of each maze grow in intricacy as the game progresses.\n\nRumour had it that the game was originally written for TSB for young savers to play in branches whilst their parents did their banking!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"John Cassar","Publisher":"TSB The Micro Club","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190274,"FileName":"fe322adf-9796-46b1-9719-0bbaecf919b3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":190274,"FileName":"d66eddb2-461b-4af3-a8ad-0f6616409ccb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":190274,"FileName":"0abbf20b-47de-45d6-a81d-2b4f2fa26eb6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":190274,"FileName":"8ea0eb6c-8ad3-4b9d-a295-f00c86ff78e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190274,"FileName":"ca002d52-9b9e-46ba-80ed-be3a437c5a08.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91129,"Name":"Creepy Cave","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Creepy Cave is a platform game for the BBC Microcomputer, published by Atlantis in 1989.\n\nOn each screen you collect crosses then confront a ghost who has stolen your front door key.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Rob Dulstone","Publisher":"Atlantis","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"dbef950d-f512-4dbd-ae3f-e84471580356.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"557c6925-3db9-4b6f-8688-db5d584a190f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"b66a8cce-a4a0-40b2-b56a-892e8cf6f9c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"a9d37ae8-836e-4054-a0c4-a9fe165a53de.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"0ca9f124-2963-4683-a637-e798dab8b604.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"cf6d9030-0146-4041-b996-aaf0053114d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91129,"FileName":"a438d2b3-6740-4a01-a6e7-1026baf78783.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153149,"Name":"Cribbage","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A computer version of the pub card game Cribbage in which you play against the computer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153149,"FileName":"dbc1d1bc-860a-4f27-8c5d-256c81153c1f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153149,"FileName":"f9c3e547-3fde-4d1f-b5c4-3758afedb01b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153149,"FileName":"d59b5c1f-ea37-4b9d-a467-d44f39a0eb4a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153149,"FileName":"faeddb61-9afd-4e52-8dec-95a88cd750dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153150,"Name":"Croaker","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A clone of the classic Frogger in which you must get five frogs back to their bases at the top of the screen.

The Time Lords have become aware of an evil force called The Master on the second moon of the planet Rijar taking over a mining base of the heatonite mineral to build a TIRU (Time Instant Reply Unit). A memory capsule on how to build a TIRU must be recovered and The Doctor must succeed as The Master plans to modify it by using The Doctor's brain to control both the past and future. The Doctor can jump, climb ladders, push buttons, and throw or use items.\n\nHe is accompanied by a robotic female cat named Splinx (who may remind you of the more famous K9 robot dog). The Doctor can only carry four items in his pockets, so Splinx is a valuable ally for fetching and carrying additional items. Even large items can fit in her dimensionally transcendental hyperspace load module. Splinx can also avoid proximity sensors and other creatures along with any items she carries.

After that, each player has a full turn, and the current player is indicated by his man moving his head from side to side on the screen.\n\nThe aim of the game is for each player to score points by collecting diamonds from the two vaults and depositing them in his own home base. Once a diamond has been removed from a vault it cannot be replaced and it retains its value until the end of the game.\n\nA diamond can be classed as being in one of three different states - either swag, loot or dump. While a diamond is still in a vault or on a drogna it is referred to as loot and can be picked up by either player. After it has been picked up and is being carried around, it is referred to as swag and the player holding it has the value of it displayed in the box at his home base labelled swag. If a player manages to deposit a diamond at his home base the diamond is referred to as dump and again its value is displayed at his home base, this time in the box labelled dump.\n\nThe player who owns a dump does not gain the score for it until another swag is dropped on top of it. Until this happens the dump can be stolen by his opponent, although the player who placed the dump in his home base is not allowed to remove it again from there.

At the time of its release it was considered to push the boundaries of what was possible on home computers, particularly on the 8-bit platforms. It remains probably the most complex game available for the BBC Micro. The game was designed and programmed by Peter Irvin (author of Starship Command, a space shoot-em-up with an innovative control system) and Jeremy Smith (author of Thrust, a game based on cave exploration with a simpler physics model). Note: The standard 32 kB BBC Model B version uses a specially defined screen resolution, smaller than full screen MODE 2. This is to free up video memory for game data - a common technique employed in complex BBC games. The simplified video hardware found in the Electron does not support this, so the additional machine-code data remains visible around the screen border.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sRFxCf5pIE","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Peter Irvin","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"ec1b3c31-1ead-4c5e-a96b-aa90e2c123d1.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"14229f50-6dfd-4fbe-aad9-dd8ae9705b7f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"41d8a7e1-ea2b-46ac-95ad-80d171c04278.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"81ddfb14-f731-4a54-a529-9b4cd9ac2a08.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"9f3d5465-98b6-463c-80d3-7928091fc6ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"56a23422-bf84-4c18-b167-b742f659ddea.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"4c929512-964b-4a2e-b348-407bd58d34ca.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"b249f3f0-0b17-4138-a2de-7e3342b723d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"cc075530-63a0-4bc2-b57a-94b08d0a0198.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90601,"FileName":"33e6397f-47ef-4360-a08b-6a25c54f10df.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153234,"Name":"Fairground","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A clone of Carnival, where you must shoot the fairground targets before the ducks reach the bottom row and devour your bullets.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"S L Ross","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153234,"FileName":"afc4b7b3-dddf-4535-8681-bd38633a5bac.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153234,"FileName":"fdf75abc-fb46-4d99-9756-60a86773556b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153234,"FileName":"10f35b44-0593-4680-abfd-80b1f975a9c1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153234,"FileName":"6a7f778d-d3c5-4e42-b4ca-3896d2ddb660.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127037,"Name":"Fantasia Diamond","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Fantasia Diamond is a traditional text adventure with static graphics, where the titular diamond, a family heirloom has been stolen and has to be retrieved from a sinister riverside fortress.

It is your job to trap the darting Leptons using a robot craft before your time runs out.\n\nAs you move the craft across the screen, a green ion-trail is dragged along behind. When you reach the edge again, the smaller area confined by this green line, is filled in. A Lepton is captured if it is trapped in this area or if 95% of the screen has been filled. A bar running along the bottom of the screen indicates the percentage of the total area remaining to be filled. Enclosed areas are coloured red, but at any time, you can switch to the faster speed and areas so filled are coloured pink.\n\nHigher levels introduce Chasers which move along the borders. A life is lost if you collide with one of these or if a Lepton hits your trail. The number of Leptons and Chasers increases up to a maximum of 5 of each. An extra craft is obtained on completion of the third, sixth and ninth screens.\n\nA good strategy is to build small, narrow pink blocks up the centre of an unfilled area in fast mode and then to finish off using the slower mode to reach the top of the screen and capture the Lepton.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"Micro Power","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"918a7a50-a2e1-447e-98d7-b538f1862329.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"04d0a464-a852-4620-9ffe-7d4dff9c061c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"f559e24a-1f74-4626-b3fe-3767850e08e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"4fbdd5ab-78a6-4374-b298-d1d023922089.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"2d19d277-f71b-4121-929d-dbc34430aadd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"cb53bd46-03f5-409b-b6dc-209a7f6848fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"592d9f0a-8e83-4779-a85e-a5b5306db2e2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124400,"FileName":"a396ecbd-f7d9-4799-b770-b5f0b0e032df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127454,"Name":"Frogger","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Frogger (aka Froggy) is Superior's version of the classic frog crossing the road platformer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"John Dyson","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127454,"FileName":"8b46efa8-0017-45e1-a633-fa2fb372e76f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127454,"FileName":"0dcb5c9f-017b-46f3-84ba-dcd609e1bdb4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127454,"FileName":"d4033892-559d-4c2a-8a32-e280500a10f0.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127454,"FileName":"51d14992-9f30-4938-bdfe-c1d458d0e11e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127454,"FileName":"90f18ad6-9e62-46e3-b0da-80833406db3b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153236,"Name":"Fruit Machine","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Fruit Machine is a three wheel simulation of slot machine for one player with options such as hold, nudge, gamble, collect and so on.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Richard Hanson","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153236,"FileName":"9033a853-af0e-4329-92c3-d86eb237e74f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153236,"FileName":"e15e3cfd-c30b-4c07-bce7-500dfb7231b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153236,"FileName":"607d47de-4ce4-4c5b-b614-a2ecabcfe8dc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153236,"FileName":"c51964cf-10db-456c-bbce-45bd4781c9f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171922,"Name":"Fruit Machine and Honest Joe","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Fruit Machine (aka Bandit) is a one-arm bandit simulation.\n\nHonest Joe is a used car dealer simulation.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Casino","Developer":"S.

After a joystick-waggling challenge to raise as much strength as possible, you can choose which muscles to assign it to, which adds an element of strategy and memory-testing.\n\nDuring each event, the 8 muscles are displayed on either side of the screen, and as one comes into use it will flash. Controlling a cursor, you must click on this as quickly as possible to achieve maximum effect. Any energy unused on each muscle is kept over for future events.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Software Communications","Publisher":"Martech","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146740,"FileName":"df880e3e-46bf-47bf-af72-918c0827fd3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":146740,"FileName":"2f384bc2-cb9b-4f93-85d7-a4ce07503431.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":146740,"FileName":"2d84f2e4-4ca8-42f2-aa52-fa9a4660febf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":146740,"FileName":"a6a4c912-60aa-4262-af62-0aae6544d29d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":146740,"FileName":"a6f7aa8d-181c-43e7-a6cd-53eaf3a8c166.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":145637,"Name":"Ghost Town","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Number 9 in the Scott Adams adventure game series.\nThe old frontier town is long since deserted, but thirteen treasures can still be retrieved from its closed mine and Boot Hill.

The numerous brain-teasers include numerical puzzles, exercises in spatial orientation, geometric pattern recognition and map navigation; several are randomized and require a fresh solution each time you play.

To help you, you are equipped with two weapons. The rapid fire laser is used to destroy any aliens in sight, while the limited supply of smart bombs vaporize alien life on screen. Extra smart bombs are awarded every 10,000 points. Hyperspace can also be used to warp from one part of the planet to another, in the hope of rescuing the humanoids faster.\nWhen Landers, one of the enemies, get close to the nearest humanoid, the Landers will pick them up and make their way to the top of the screen. If you do not shoot the Landers before they reach the status bar, both them, plus the captured humanoid, will explode. If you manage to shoot the Lander, the humanoid is released and it is your job to maneuver the ship under them so they can be taken back to the terrain. If you don't do this, then the humanoid will explode once they reach the terrain.\nA scanner, found at the top of the screen, shows the location of your ship, enemies, and humanoids. This scanner is very useful in keeping track of enemies that are approaching you from behind, as well as locating the enemies that have captured humanoids. Once you have killed all enemies in the level, the next level begins. Bonus points are awarded for each humanoid saved.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Steve Evans","Publisher":"Alligata Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":102508,"FileName":"9494c028-3614-4c14-b45f-187b76050d6d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":102508,"FileName":"64dbb35c-fb3a-4447-b04b-d34f91f98001.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":102508,"FileName":"d2b4a24f-9711-406a-a64c-74e3eb3cea3e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":102508,"FileName":"a0857184-61f1-4e48-9ccc-984b61ae5b25.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128457,"Name":"Gulp!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Gulp!

Both yourself and the aliens are armed with lethal lazers, although you can take several hits before dying.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku1vVfH_rok","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Powerhouse","Publisher":"Mandarin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"b04bcb13-07c4-40f1-9c68-21f360a35622.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"c6cd61bd-cb66-4657-a33b-42adc740fedb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"dc681153-a259-45de-81a8-fe96f6d52399.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"70674933-0b33-4b3d-bb25-ce9674808e80.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"6d62feae-5346-4806-b1c6-3da3a867fe2c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"200d3a7a-3f56-47d6-adfb-07dcd026b8aa.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"7219c4ac-1a73-44df-971c-f9af23bf1941.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"9b8625c4-962b-4af8-9fc7-2e66977984f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":125142,"FileName":"5be37cdd-e225-4d54-a0b0-132d334351da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90652,"Name":"Imogen","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Imogen is a computer game released in 1986, originally only for the BBC Micro. It was written by Michael St Aubyn and published by Micro Power. It was reissued as the lead game of Superior Software / Acornsoft's Play It Again Sam 5 compilation in 1988 when it was also converted for the Acorn Electron. It is a platform game featuring puzzles.\n\n\n\nThe game features sixteen levels which are played in a random order. To complete a level, Imogen needs to obtain a spell fragment which will warp him to the next level or, after all sixteen have been collected and the spell completed, to the outside world, thus completing the game. The spell fragments are always placed somewhere inaccessible at the outset of the level, and obtaining the spell fragments requires some lateral thinking on behalf of the player.\n\nImogen himself is able to transform into three different forms, each with an ability unavailable to the other two.\n\nEach level (consisting of a sealed cavern 4 screens in size) requires transforming back and forth between the forms to complete it. While it is impossible for the player to actually die during the game, the number of transformations is limited to 150, and using them all before the game is complete renders it unwinnable.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Michael St. Aubyn","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"a3fc64a1-68d3-4154-8e34-699458e49864.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"3cf425fe-e8e8-49f7-b3b6-3fb5cc6b93dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"d7f183c1-4615-4890-9c55-6bd5adc58f1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"de5c6624-9e2c-454c-b9d4-5dbe55c7a4eb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"56224d2f-a992-4b83-a65f-337b5021c000.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"85e3640d-3a60-4c12-b845-ccd3d9f1a0bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90652,"FileName":"1678f0d9-f50b-4b72-b8fa-4ee930c2f33f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134471,"Name":"Impact","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Impact is an old break-out style game.

The timer is reset each time a tile is collected.\nThe panel to the lower left of the playing area shows the number of lives remaining. A life is gained for each tile collected, and a maximum of 12 lives is allowed. The panel to the lower right of the screen gives an indication of the number of tiles left to be collected.

You score five points for each tile collected and you lose three points for each life lost.\nWhen you lose a life you continue the game at the place where you last collected a shaded tile or sometimes at the last but one.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"The Fourth Dimension","Publisher":"The Fourth Dimension","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":119391,"FileName":"d7d617c4-6185-472c-96d8-4f0a96eb4c1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119391,"FileName":"1e8d3528-a406-4182-a869-ab43d57fcaa7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119391,"FileName":"c8e193a7-97ce-48e9-844a-59762165a63c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119391,"FileName":"83c4d328-6c19-4ffe-a5c0-f9db82846e82.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119391,"FileName":"46b0fa2b-e893-4bbf-a4a1-e47650010f25.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":119391,"FileName":"45fa0845-aad8-40a3-8185-d35a6c5d9322.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124382,"Name":"Infinity","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"An arcade adventure which sees you stranded on a strange planet.

Extra lives are also awarded when the player scores 10,000 points.\nThe enemies and obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid.

At the time, it was a highly acclaimed Acornsoft release, with its high resolution graphics, addictive gameplay and fluid animation.\n\nIn 1987 the game was reissued on Superior Software's Acornsoft Hits compilation.\n\n\n\nLabyrinth is a scrolling 2D shoot 'em up, consisting of a complex labyrinth made up of multiple levels. Each level is made up of a number of rooms, with the player only able to see a single room at any one time. Doorways are provided allowing the player to move between rooms.\n\n\n\nEach level contains two special rooms, the 'Gate Room', and the 'Key Room'. The Gate Room contains an impenetrable gate, beyond which lies the next level. The Key Room contains a jewel which will open the gate, and is generally the most well-guarded and dangerous room in the level.\n\n\n\nRooms are populated with a variety of monsters, which become more and more dangerous as the player progresses through the game. The player is able to shoot or avoid the various monsters, as well as squash them with a \"boulder\" that the player is able to push around with them as they travel. Colliding with a monster will cause the player to lose health, often leading to the player's death.\n\n\n\nDifferent types of fruit are scattered throughout the labyrinth, which will increase the player's health when eaten. The player slowly, but consistently, loses health at all times while in the Labyrinth, and will eventually die without eating fruit.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle; Shooter","Developer":"Michael Mathison","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"e12ce8d8-501d-4694-a6c8-11c069a8723f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"f2c1fd97-901e-41ff-9eeb-962650ecc172.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"0ce5d4c6-565f-49bf-89c0-10e639999ac1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"f9eccb4f-d0f0-4600-a130-3cd3145f5c8d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"946c5093-37c7-4800-b675-e3943cf8345c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"07c0479b-e34e-4edf-8571-5d12daac9626.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90641,"FileName":"e5730a9f-0f82-4402-b6bb-84027e0f21d5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":153273,"Name":"Labyrinths of La Coshe","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"An adventure in which you must discover the secret entrance to the labyrinths beneath the ancient Grecian town of La Coshe.

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players.\nGame A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Audiogenic Software","Publisher":"Audiogenic Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":113653,"FileName":"f0ab0df5-40c4-41da-89a7-88790afe7188.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":113653,"FileName":"3867e9d9-128f-4d6f-91af-2784743bca5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":113653,"FileName":"1e9dae55-56ac-4e56-82ff-04b90d34f6d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":113653,"FileName":"2bd60cb2-0ed3-4e6f-af70-d4ab3aa4aef2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":113653,"FileName":"4fab54ff-3bba-4c2c-88cf-3e86edcf649e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":113653,"FileName":"9ecb79bb-5510-4e68-a099-0278099a0778.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134470,"Name":"Lord of the Rings: Game One","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"An interactive adventure game based on the first volume of J.R.R.

Down the bottom of the screen are a number of columns and above these LEGO blocks (here called ogles) in various colours move back and forth. When starting out the right most column is filled with blocks and the player's task is to recreate this stack in the corresponding column on the left side of the screen. This is done by controlling a dog called Flash and picking up the right blocks and then dropping these in the right column. If a block is dropped in the wrong column it will automatically be dumped into a bin. Once the stack has fully been recreated the game moves on to the next level which features one extra stack to recreate.\n\nThere are two difficulty levels: one for younger persons and one for older persons. The difference lie in that the second level is played against a clock and features a scoring system. Each correctly placed block is worth ten points while a block dumped into the bin leads to twenty points being decreased. When completing a level ten time the number left on the clock is given in extra points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkeTXVB7IkE","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Andrew Richard Webb","Publisher":"Games Machine Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"907bb482-7be5-4e61-af28-8bb31afd61f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"a964f486-0cc7-40bf-9850-9b9fe0034d3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"3016b503-7ee5-4a85-abac-b755fba7274a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"accab8e8-bf17-4bce-a3d7-644f999c5090.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"ccef847e-a119-4551-97ee-02d8cf10053c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"b660a4a6-9406-4c7c-92bc-7861f81f71ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"8fb62293-9530-4487-9df4-f0b2746196e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"cfd3a188-b7ed-47a5-9fa9-1224fb6970d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"89cacccd-6d97-4d05-8c1d-140cd20e7497.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"84c09a22-5177-4b5c-93c9-fb48ad152ff4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"812f2f4d-d4ee-42ba-9d77-0984a19648b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"a2d7739e-147e-481a-972c-68531778bfa9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"d69389c5-bb0a-440d-a678-925bcedf7bed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160294,"FileName":"7480c28b-c509-4563-9cb8-a965cf699a94.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136949,"Name":"Old Father Time","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A text adventure in which your mission is to rescue Old Father Time's staff and hourglass, and return them to him before the sands of time run out.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGwipDzH1Y","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","Publisher":"Bug-Byte Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":136949,"FileName":"1578f37f-1fb1-4a08-9b60-e308639a5315.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136949,"FileName":"481e1dd1-2b1d-4947-9c7e-a06e557e2f98.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136949,"FileName":"b229ce58-771f-42eb-80cf-d0b7ea75824e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136949,"FileName":"82b686d4-7571-4778-a947-dc063fa7035c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136949,"FileName":"795aab6e-94bd-46bd-bb33-6d38a1239d8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":160292,"Name":"Olsen","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Olsen is an arcade-puzzle game that might look like a Pengo at first glance.

Painter's gameplay is very similar to Amidar's bonus stages where the traditional boxes in the screen have points associated with. It can also be compared to Potty Painter in the Jungle which was one of the first Amidar variations for ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.\n\nPainter's main goal is to fill all the boxes in each frame in a certain period of time by completing the pathways (lines) around them. This must be done before the \"Bonus\" value reaches zero. To complicate things the \"Painter\" has to avoid any collision with the \"Chasers\", some entities present in the game that will try to intercept him and destroy his work. The \"Painter\" will be forced to restart the phase all over again and one of his lives will be lost in the process.\n\nTo defend himself during his gameplay and specially from the incredible speed the \"Chasers\" might get at the last skill factors of the game, the player has in his power a special tool: a gap creator. This weapon will create a temporary gap in the pathway lines preventing the \"Chasers\" from colliding with him. It can only be used three times at a time before any temporary gap is removed.\n\nThe limit of Painter's skill factor is 6. \"Chasers\" intelligence and speed will increase proportionally to the skill factor and dramatically at this point of the gaming. Prepare yourself to be ambushed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXbJSQD8HuA","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"A&F Software","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":169683,"FileName":"6307ac99-8f83-427e-b4bb-1e1806d8c681.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":169683,"FileName":"4febae51-03e6-4b0b-a209-ab61766812ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90456,"Name":"Palace of Magic","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"A game along similar lines to Citadel.

Once you have cleared a floor then you can use stairs to take you to the next floor.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"David Croft","Publisher":"Tynesoft Computer Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"6b697af9-6866-4c2d-85d0-8fe12ac3b9df.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"715e6d7e-9376-45eb-b9b9-6eb36ce69d48.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"447d728a-3775-4d43-9b5a-618fca3c0f5a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"0fcfc11b-6e13-45a3-97c6-4b0422a5cec0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"a5baa40a-8106-47eb-aa71-e8f682ee0afb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"c71c84c8-49cc-45da-8dea-86b51437d155.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"f27aa79e-1c71-44b1-9ea1-0b876c12b291.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"532c58af-d7ce-4b9c-b0f6-df27faa1b2fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"0dda565e-44d5-4f56-a549-855845b0f1c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"8366e507-c892-4e5d-b0c1-30f1ce9329fa.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"0a4187a2-4a0c-4db9-8039-d0a4a826ab75.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135841,"FileName":"f41aa83a-58c5-4773-85a1-794b536da146.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135842,"Name":"Phantom Combat","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"A flight simulator based around the RAF's commission of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II jet interceptor and fighter-bomber.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Doctor Soft","Publisher":"Doctor Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"e39f3d44-7360-4a7b-b908-f9a70e956882.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"82b3a28d-6928-4d02-bfa2-c099c25ad74c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"01edef2c-5cca-4b7c-886f-9c39946aa046.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"dd33f904-3e22-4121-aafd-94ffc014fa39.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"82578f6f-648b-4fd8-8c6d-4b57ba3182d2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"ce9847d2-3c24-40a5-9073-a05970b3b77e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135842,"FileName":"69e3f608-f58c-49c4-95ec-dfb91235a508.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90781,"Name":"Philosopher's Quest","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Welcome to the adventure!

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".\n\nThe game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"The Assembly Line","Publisher":"Empire Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"824a69fb-d71d-444c-bcb1-7cadfd846a8f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"8df4af3b-e267-4d0a-9a43-6e688ed50366.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"18f6f9ee-e1ac-4119-b1b9-55d81e2f8200.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"e471456c-d438-484f-ba42-b5ce2b43cbc1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"a8643b12-76a6-4c7c-889d-90c773602fea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"04800e3e-209d-464e-8539-ebb5adb4624d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":124296,"FileName":"9f4c8a1c-5527-46f1-910e-128e559631db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90606,"Name":"Pipeline","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Pipeline is a computer game for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, originally published by Superior Software in 1988.

His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him.

Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour.

The player takes control of the eponymous lizard Repton who for each of the game's twelve levels has to collect all of its diamonds. At the same time he has to watch out for falling boulders and monsters that may roam around and try to kill him. The time is limited and when it runs out the player loses a life. A life is also lost when being caught by a monster or being crushed beneath a boulder. The main difference between Repton and Boulder Dash is that Repton is calmer and has a focus on puzzle solving rather than quick arcade action. Often there is only a specific route to take that the player must figure out or he risks being trapped between boulders. Some levels have eggs, safes and keys. When eggs fall they will crack and a reptile will emerge from it. The player should avoid the reptiles as he will lose a life if he comes into contact with them. Keys needs to be picked up to open the safes. Once opened a diamond will be revealed. The game uses a password system so the player can jump straight to the level he has the password for.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Tim Tyler","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"208f2b17-8772-4c96-8027-5a90406ae950.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"0a23e4b4-351f-4290-a8d1-311e26d0d065.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"9b451d71-2840-4abb-8838-491673bbc4f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"1bc63b86-14b3-4684-8867-13a71ffb7969.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"655a25dc-7248-4106-ac98-42b12e63949a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"f2d508be-dc2c-4c24-a6ea-5662b7f47bb4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"85e8951c-2d4a-427a-99a5-25154b750264.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90352,"FileName":"564a4fe4-4fb0-4244-a2ed-16a7fb34e101.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90353,"Name":"Repton 2","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Repton 2 is, just like its predecessor, a puzzle solving game about collecting diamonds. It features a number of new features and changes from the original formula. The biggest change is that instead of separate levels it now features one big world where each sector is connected with teleporters. The basic gameplay is very similar though. The player digs his way through the dirt in search for diamonds and other objects and has to watch out for falling boulders or monsters (reptiles) that are out for him. Monsters appear from cracked eggs and will kill the player if he comes into contact with them. They can be killed with falling boulders. There are also spirits who follow the walls to their left until they reach a cage. In the cage the spirit transforms into a diamond. To get all the diamonds the player therefore has to guide all the spirits to their cages. The player can also collect jigsaw puzzle pieces. These will then appear at the first screen and form the sentence \"Repton 2 Is Ended\". On the topmost levels of the world the player has to watch out for meteors that fall from the sky.\n\nThe game involves more than just collecting diamonds. To complete the game the player has to do all of the following:\ncollect all of the 4,744 earth sections\ncollect all of the 1,634 diamonds\nkill all of the 18 monsters\nuse all of the 64 transporters\ncollect all of the 42 jigsaw puzzle pieces\ncollect a \"finish character\"\n\nUnlike the original game there is no time limit in Repton 2.

Before this can be done however the player has to collect all diamonds and golden crowns and kill all monsters. Failing to do this within a certain time will result in the bombs exploding and the player losing a life. There are a number of puzzles that have to be solved and everything has to be done in a certain order or else the player may block himself in. Therefore it's necessary to plan ahead and pick the right route. As usual the player has to watch out for falling boulders as well as monsters, spirits, skulls and fungus. In addition to boulders this game also features balloons that are equally lethal but float upwards. There are also certain doors that the player can remove only by collecting absorbalene pills.\n\nAn editor is included to allow the player to modify characters and levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Tom Walker","Publisher":"Retro Software","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"8fb84d5c-bbb8-439f-9d6f-55da211ec444.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"becd1b2b-ad60-4b1f-8b2d-ff29eede0784.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"3cee0ffc-7e60-419d-a947-16a351dd4e5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"e6307585-e72f-4af1-a7fe-e83dae90c49a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"035aeddd-eee9-444f-abc8-af0f7d11f143.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"c9de9df6-bd28-4f89-864b-e1897e3c6190.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"8e041f68-8c18-435b-b204-7bb9acfc5ae3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"ff239273-2708-44a9-b8b8-4aef7d8df5bf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"5d21a21d-ebb0-4797-9a85-7f0781762847.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135000,"FileName":"2208c0e4-6753-4890-bc39-96aef095b103.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127692,"Name":"Return of R2","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Your aim is to guide the robot droid R2 around the space station Zegler in order to find and collect the 3 boxes of the compound Z42.

There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.\n\nSuccessful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.\n\nThe game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.\n\nThe BBC Micro/Electron versions were programmed by Peter Scott.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"6b8968bc-445e-40b9-9a28-033b5cc7a1f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"513b6054-6521-4994-be9c-6334c1658b80.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"43ed8dcc-e413-4132-9c18-1995bb598835.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"07878e87-2b38-474b-bcc4-f9c4580599d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"c511a850-515d-4a2f-bf47-b55854281063.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"5f429ee3-9a97-4ecc-8e90-e6b7f43ccbae.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"adaa3eaf-f56b-431d-99e0-24cf9ec38023.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"64d2d6d3-7b8d-4970-9e7b-3217d56cf546.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":132412,"FileName":"c9776f56-d065-4ada-8a00-d6241a55a22e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127684,"Name":"Sinbad","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Sinbad is an action, platform game that is very loosely based on the stories about Sinbad the Sailor. It consists of two stages each with completely different gameplay.\n\nThe first one is viewed from the side and the task here is to convert Sinbad's enemies to a peaceful way of life. A magic carpet with a rope ladder attached to it as well as a number of enemies are moving all around the screen. Sinbad converts the enemies by touching them but to be able to reach them he has to jump up and climb the ladder. However after they have been converted making contact with them again will lead to Sinbad falling off the ladder which makes it increasingly harder to reach the remaining enemies.\n\nWhen all enemies have been converted the game moves on to the second stage where Sinbad sits on the magic carpet and flies through space. This stage is played from a behind the back view of Sinbad and the task is to fly past the numerous asteroids that appear without getting hit. It's also necessary to avoid flying to high or into the atmosphere since that will lead to energy being drained. If too much energy is lost the game will end. The time that the player has to stay alive for in the second stage is the same as the time needed to complete the first stage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Dennis Ibbotson","Publisher":"Virgin Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127684,"FileName":"129a593a-ea46-450e-99a8-f59612deb533.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127684,"FileName":"ce7b653f-2899-47a9-be5d-b4f3340bd3ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127684,"FileName":"56ddd443-b0c6-4a6b-b435-d4bdc9d4beff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127684,"FileName":"15141c2f-caa2-460c-8db1-a8cce18505bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127684,"FileName":"d430e0ea-5ec2-4033-a3b6-b95471190551.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":127684,"FileName":"9ce36d07-0ffa-4001-95eb-95c8d282a168.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127672,"Name":"Skirmish","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"A clone of the arcade game Joust.\n\nNote:\nAardvark's plans to publish Joust were well advanced, but a licensing deal with Atari could not be struck.

Instead, you are transformed into a frog, sitting at the bottom of the screen, and your wife is given the opportunity to climb down to the bottom to free you from the spell.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Pace","Publisher":"Pace","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"9170e6db-5071-4a54-be73-b23c5263b44f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"6122d403-a5e4-4dc9-a814-32baa87fe1bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"f98850f7-ea9c-45fe-bca5-eb26d22063aa.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"cf7eb49a-7a3e-4ae3-aaeb-5cb4b7b84580.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"65b5640b-dae5-44d4-b272-65232f87b7c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"a06e80c5-ae2f-4a11-9678-16ab98c65448.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101395,"FileName":"cfaba426-cb4e-4a93-98b2-799013a30315.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168566,"Name":"Southern Belle","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"The ultimate aim is to travel from London to Brighton taking your place on the footplate of this King Arthur class 4-6-0 locomotive.

Players command an aircraft through different environments, shooting down planes to collect points. The ship's nose can be rotated left or right, so the craft can move into any direction and take sharp turns left or right. Speed is not controlled by the user and it is always maintained at the same level automatically. The background is wrapped endlessly both horizontally and vertically, and that way it is impossible to encounter a border. The game takes place in five time periods: 1916, 1940, 1970, 1984 and 1999. Each level holds different types of enemies, from classic biplanes to spitfires, helicopters, jets and UFOs.\n\nIn each scene the player needs to shoot eight regular planes to decrease an icon bar of planes in the top left corner. For every icon that disappears a sound is played and a new squadron arrives. Once all the icons are gone a large boss ship appears and it takes multiple hits to destroy it. After taking it out the plane travels through time to a new period. The player's aircraft has an unlimited amount of bullets. Enemy planes have bullets too, but some of them can also drop bombs or fire homing missiles. In certain environments paratroopers with a red cross appear; these can be collected for bonus points. There are four lives in total before the game is over, but for every 10,000 points a new life is granted. No more than five lives can be held. When all time periods have been completed, the cycle of the five scenes is restarted, but the score is kept.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEpMfa7Qp4A","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Peter Johnson","Publisher":"Superior Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153351,"FileName":"538b2011-0867-487d-a78f-d0c6eb90d5e7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153351,"FileName":"afa23ea5-b74c-409a-889c-de1d9d8f8609.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153351,"FileName":"b8b8c407-ea37-43ab-9d79-a714db945baf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153351,"FileName":"4f7441ca-1a26-475b-9224-6276be8f9525.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153351,"FileName":"25e12ccd-1baf-4d56-ab63-24b4750d044c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":153351,"FileName":"851daeb8-760d-43bb-ae9a-0253c26bb54b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138346,"Name":"Space Station Alpha","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"AS commander of a space station, your mission is to destroy the ships of the invading Cylon fleet before their lithium missiles can hit the earth.\nThe Cylons attack in waves of fifty.

They were 14½ and 16 when they started coding the game in 1986. The equipment used to write it was a memory monitor chip, a monochrome 14\" TV, a cassette tape recorder and their own BASIC-written graphic-design software. The game was originally named Magelords, later to be named Spellbinder by Superior Software marketing team.\n\nUnusually, for a BBC Micro game, it featured continuous background music - a version of Midnight Summer Dream, the 1983 song from British rock group The Stranglers' album Feline.\n\nThe player has to navigate his way through the castle, collect ingredients and make spells that can be used on the various creatures that roam the castle. The player sees his character from a side view and uses the keyboard to navigate him between rooms and interact with the environment. The castle consists of two floors, three citadels, a catacomb and a dungeon and to move between the different levels teleports or portals have to be used. There are also secret passages, one-way doors and doors that only appear after certain tasks has been accomplished.\n\nTo create spells the player has to collect the various ingredients that can be found around the castle and then mix them together. Among the ingredients there are burned ashes that is used for spells that causes effects on enemies, sulphur that is used for curing wounds, toad's legs that are used for freezing spells and dried roots which is used on spells intended for the spellbinder. Example of spells include heal which is made by mixing sulphur and dried roots while freeze which slows down enemies is created by combining toad's legs and burned ashes. Regular spells doesn't kill enemies but can be used to avoid their bad effects.

It's modelled very generally on the original Crowther and Woods' Colossal Caves. You'll meet some familiar characters in it, though, to be fair, it is nothing like Colossal Caves and is a very worthy adventure in its own right.\n\nYour task is to search an underground complex to add yet more treasures to the pile you have built up from previous adventures. You start your quest on a well-trodden road and a quick search of the countryside should find you equipped for the start of your quest. Then it's off to the Valley of Doom and down the Hall of Spirits for the start of your perils. You'll soon come across a pirate and a dwarf who will leave you an axe.\n\nYour first major problem is likely to be in getting past the fiery passage - this is where you find out whether you have the bottle for this adventure! Later you'll need to escape from a sea-serpent - match that if you can! The troll shouldn't prove to be much of a problem. You should be able to discover where he puts his loot. Right! That's enough clues!\n\nOne thing I couldn't discover was whether there was any meaning to the graffiti in the Inner Sanctum. I'm sure that there are more locations to be discovered here. Please let me know if you have figured it out.\n\nI've managed to map more than 100 locations so it is a big adventure. In fact I must confess that it is one of those games that keeps you up until the small hours. Five o' clock in my case.\n\nOverall, an extremely good adventure and one that I can wholeheartedly recommend. Let's hope Acornsoft do conversions for their other adventures. Excellent stuff.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123080,"FileName":"9d446956-a107-4636-a830-eb5ea5f6e7a8.png","Type":"Box -

The larger ships have cloaking devices which make them invisible. Damage is inflicted on ships when they are shot or rammed by other ships. Uniquely for the time, the player vessel remains locked in the centre of the screen and the world rotates and moves around it. Player shots also have limited range and are subject to the same rotation as everything else, which means the player needs to predict where shots will need to go in order to hit the enemies. The ship has both long range scanners and shields but may only use one at a time. By default, the game will automatically switch between them based on the proximity of enemy vessels but the player can optionally take full control. Using shields, thrusting, turning and firing all use up energy which is also depleted when hit by enemies.

It is a Space Invaders variant. The player controls his defender ship left and right and has to prevent aliens from landing by shooting at them. Some protection is offered by four bastions which can take some shots before being destroyed. This version of the game offers three different difficulties with the harder ones offering some additional gameplay features. The easier one, A Mild Encounter, plays like traditional Space Invaders. In the Uncomfortable Situation difficulty the UFO, when it survives without being shot, produces a force shield that guides the aliens and hastens their speed. The hard mode is called A Terrifying Experience and here the alien projectiles have a homing capability and follow the player. There are three different kinds of aliens and they are scored depending on how far from the player they are. The player has three lives and an extra is earned after 5000 and 15000 points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmOd33jXqWM","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Acornsoft","Publisher":"Acornsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"a001a035-929b-4e17-8090-18f2e300f2bf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"8e6cca8f-731c-44b3-82a5-b464f81469f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"ed48f022-84ff-4dbd-b9a4-b59b98cc5f15.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"8bd0b266-212d-4d24-b386-c9bab8e545d7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"b5dab461-076a-4a99-971f-b3d52da25af9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"11324d4d-0490-4257-a7a4-3219ef6bdaf1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"3799be81-7d32-4335-9946-40226fa1ad22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":101817,"FileName":"893ea571-85d6-44e1-97d6-b1b1f3898351.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":169827,"Name":"Super Pool","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Robin Leatherbarrow","Publisher":"Software Invasion","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":169827,"FileName":"d4b8c49a-8fda-49a1-b964-3f6ee5266288.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":169827,"FileName":"ddb8245e-5cb3-4da3-9936-9e5c71ebca6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":169827,"FileName":"920f8798-82b1-49d6-9c6c-343beb317331.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":169827,"FileName":"0137e083-93fa-4775-aa4f-d1f5b5137833.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":169827,"FileName":"6ccf74ca-dae2-4f1e-bf72-3bf8c01e20f7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150980,"Name":"Superior Soccer","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"This game combines football management with actual game playing.

Droid 1 is the only droid that can dig through the earth, Droid 2 can beam survivors to safety (by moving over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at a time). The goal in each of the seven levels is to rescue all survivors within the time limit, while paying attention not to trap or damage any of the droids. Removing sand or pushing around rocks might cause other rocks to fall down and crash the droids. There are also Guardian Droids whose circuits have been damaged by the nuclear fall-out, causing them to run rampant.

You accomplish this by collecting the heaps of diamonds which appear on the screen, and taking them to the cache in your house. Unfortunately, the other robber is not your only problem. There are several killer droids, employed by one of the insurance companies, who try to apprehend bandits such as yourself and recover the swag.\nThere are two types of the droids Henrys and Percys. One type will try to catch you; the other your opponent. You can \"convert\" one which is following you by shooting it. You can also shoot the other player's man, and if caught by a droid or shot you will drop your swag and be returned to your house. Naturally, you will soon use up all the ammunition in your gun, but you can get more by depositing gold in the bank. The other way to convert droids is to move onto a \"DH\", which changes all Henrys to Percys, and vice versa.\nMoving onto a Smiley has the effect of sending your opponent back to his house.\nIf you shoot a police car, it will follow you around the screen, which gives points to the other player, though you can stop this by drinking a can of beer (the sort which refreshes the parts other beers can't) and shooting them again.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Dave Herbert","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91093,"FileName":"a16ec9f9-ca9f-4a04-91fa-5052ed209637.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91093,"FileName":"0dcdb70c-085b-4e3f-8fa9-f9ffc23b1617.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91093,"FileName":"76c767e8-b692-42d9-9ab8-55cf556f4649.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91093,"FileName":"55ced914-eff1-4634-b46d-970c1895e690.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91093,"FileName":"44df7660-e89d-4481-8342-45a790d0f736.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91093,"FileName":"babd4fdc-2a3d-4df9-a757-ae252f022628.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123223,"Name":"Swarm","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Swarm is a fixed shooter in which you have to shoot incoming aliens, that will also shoot at you.

But, unbeknownst to Vileroth, it was the Secret Cloak that controlled the Stars and protected the wearer from their awesome powers. Unable to master the Stars, Vileroth was undone. In his final days, as Vileroth's strength slipped from him, he concealed the thirteen Stars of Power within the Castle of Claymorgue, determined that no-one save he should possess them. Solon, learning of Vileroth's destruction, despatched his faithful young apprentice Beanwick to retrieve the Stars. \"Tread carefully, O Beanwick! Would that I could assume this quest myself, but alas, I can only send with you these few spells. Claymorgue Castle harbours further spells, but beware - one unskilled in the arts cannot predict their outcome.\"","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Scott Adams","Publisher":"Adventure International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":136942,"FileName":"571bd4c0-79ba-4a9f-98d3-2edd2f0b654f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136942,"FileName":"851bab31-e77d-431a-a45d-5b9e545964b1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136942,"FileName":"6db0ef67-417b-4874-9628-bd6c34b2e48c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136942,"FileName":"30dc56dc-4d4f-4a94-ae53-08f71570ca6a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136942,"FileName":"e914b7d7-32ba-480d-8d23-705b926e9da9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136942,"FileName":"c0188809-ed7d-4983-8179-60d48a993802.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90640,"Name":"The Tombs of Tutankhamen","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Published by Beebug magazine vol 5, issue 5.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Jonathan Temple","Publisher":"Beebug","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90640,"FileName":"f50a1e44-239e-46cd-a156-31915d8f66a8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90640,"FileName":"a57e814b-59d3-49db-bae5-f0e96910134a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":90640,"FileName":"82f01c95-e0a4-43d4-b984-1dd506b3011f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90640,"FileName":"5a0244d2-e33b-4840-aa2f-050081a8e2ca.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90640,"FileName":"51c6effe-bb7d-4117-8462-5cab306264e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90640,"FileName":"b46f33bf-392d-4e9d-b427-b0a81db61816.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197398,"Name":"The Valley","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The Valley is a graphical roguelike RPG with a simple interface and semi-real-time combat system.

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.\n\nTwo game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. \n\nOne additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.","MaxPlayers":"6","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Oxford Digital Enterprises","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"5ffd40ec-bf94-4e11-b6a0-06e1470b4462.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"06deec3f-c30b-44d7-b741-5018a4bd7688.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"a832bea3-b191-4243-8d2d-ef0340ab16ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"33f8b6d2-a30a-4b68-881c-aa5126375a14.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"d1723112-abec-46a2-a9dd-b7b93d04f06d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"79dea141-7e30-4677-87e0-5979243b33b6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"2c35baf8-73dc-4d67-aed9-14a688a48636.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"21b9f71b-1db9-4b00-ab51-1466fee1ad55.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":157070,"FileName":"e17d099e-4924-49c5-a4c1-ee39e7fba95d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126327,"Name":"Twin Kingdom Valley","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Twin Kingdom Valley is a graphic text adventure where you will see a picture (with some animation) of your location before seeing a text description of what you can see, any items and any characters in that location.

You as the people's champion have been chosen to get their WOKS back.\nThere are nine rooms containing the Woks, unfortunately some rooms have more guards than others; the first three have only one guard in each, the next three have two in each, the last three rooms have three guards in each. The only advantage you have is that the guards are highly disciplined and never change the route of their patrol. You must learn the routes if you are to have any chance of defeating them.\nThe Woks have been evenly distributed about the rooms, eight in each. Once you have collected all the Woks you then must get the key to open the exit door to the next room.\nYou have a limited time in each room indicated by the counting down bonus score. If the bonus reaches zero you lose a life. Remember that you only have four lives - you can't afford to waste any.\nIf by some miracle you manage to clear all nine rooms, you are returned to the first one to begin your quest.

The player controls his space ship along the bottom of the screen and has to shoot at the aliens that move around above him. The enemies fly in formations and will either try to shoot or collide with the player's ship. Once all of the aliens have been killed the player moves on to the next level. After every few levels there is a challenge stage where the enemies fly past in a certain pattern and the player has to shoot down as many as possible. Some ships can trap the player's ship with a tractor beam. The player can then recapture it by destroying the ship that captured it and thereby get two ships at once with twice the fire power.\n\nZalaga can be played by one or two players with either keyboard or joystick. An operator mode allows the player to customize some of the settings, such as start screen, automatic fire and reload speed.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQ0UqDvo8A","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Aardvark Software","Publisher":"Alternative Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"90b3e60e-368a-43ef-b346-209d6b01639f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"eaf2c9bc-8768-4037-bdeb-0e29b29997ee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"94b1c91a-d6b4-403b-a24d-cecc40f3d593.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"7e20610e-abb4-4c66-b276-6b2d28e8a860.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"d5172918-5209-4d9d-a490-4d0ce3f5b1df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"3429f3d9-c441-44fa-beb8-161cb8fc7d52.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"ddc3529f-0e2a-4b9a-bbd5-41bbf99df045.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"d0bde968-c581-4d7a-996a-7f2dae5baaec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"25fbbf32-02f4-4de1-a229-fa8a206901a3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"35f8ef55-3430-4e2b-817a-5728899c8247.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91305,"FileName":"27e2ee71-b4a1-473d-acfe-9416a0bef48d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90587,"Name":"Zany Kong Junior","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"The evil Morris has kidnapped Zany Kong.

This feature should be used carefully as it uses up a lot of fuel, thus reducing your bonus.\nYou can only use each landing pad once, and there are different hazards to negotiate on each return journey.\nWhen all of the scout party have been rescued, you return to level one but with a higher gravity.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Micro Power","Publisher":"Micro Power","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91324,"FileName":"c2b4d014-6485-4257-8aba-73d3b2c8857c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91324,"FileName":"92640725-af3f-4fc8-98c4-26d149650292.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91324,"FileName":"f1dea558-9bbe-4151-bfea-0f5a2ce519f6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91324,"FileName":"c14ee373-2696-42b0-ba57-ee8d0371180e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91324,"FileName":"025ca277-a861-461b-8adf-d192b6493d6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91324,"FileName":"0288d86a-e5ee-4317-a8bb-eea876b6f842.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91323,"Name":"Zenon","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Zenon is a video game developed by Ian Collinson and published for the BBC Microcomputer by Impact Software.\n\nIt's a side-scrolling shooter comprising of 250 levels. \nYou have 4 lives to complete each of the levels which are approximately 10 times the length of the screen.\nTo complete a level, you must generally keep moving to the right whilst avoiding and shooting such aliens, fireballs and meteorites.\nThe game can be played by one player or two players together.\n\nAt the start of each level, you will be beamed down to the surface of Zenon. If two players are selected then both players will be beamed down together. You cannot harm another player by shooting at him.\nFor a short period after beaming down you will be immune to hostile attacks. This is signified by the energy indicator flashing on and off on your status panel.\nYou can run along the surface or fly using your everlasting atomic jetpack. Various enemies will attack you and you must either shoot or avoid them. Contact with these or their laser shots will reduce your energy and when you lose all energy you will lose one of your 4 lives. After losing a life you will once again be immune to hostile attacks for a short period.\nIf you can avoid being hit for a while your energy will gradually increase. However, it is also possible to obtain extra energy by collecting energy cells that appear from time to time. These are flashing diamonds with a letter 'E' inside them.\nYour current weapon is shown on your status panel but you can select different types by collecting the weapon canisters as they pass.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Ian Collinson","Publisher":"Impact","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"e0b2d6e8-1f2a-4a68-9420-392c25f5a69a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"d5a3b757-e379-4f57-8f08-4a77ab49e64f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"2f87316f-b6d7-495f-b173-f004285e3cd3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"f0804a8b-4813-4dd3-b3d5-586aa27b7386.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"c4cefb6e-681b-46fe-8574-e1f41246d6b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"fca6c673-b95a-4060-8df3-edf1fe873471.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"3962a9eb-6bb1-4c43-9501-7222858ae246.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"68e40251-61fb-4b14-a68e-604d3aa5ce43.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"ac18c62d-277b-4fce-9bfe-65a8918b9931.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91323,"FileName":"282576cf-5e5e-4449-8266-8da877daeca6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91327,"Name":"Ziggy","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Ziggy was developed by Dean Lester and published for the BBC Microcomputer by Audiogenic Software.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f30dW6tjtFo","Platform":"BBC Microcomputer System","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Dean Lester","Publisher":"Audiogenic Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"2d2ec813-b279-4667-86b2-637053d4b851.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"b22dd321-b850-4133-84c8-965c33b087df.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"3bf68cdc-c70b-4d19-8e19-fee7c8a44115.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"ffd26336-bb6c-4ab2-8880-2b5b21e57355.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"8d853953-a403-4445-b5af-b61512f107ee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"01a8b71f-c37f-4e21-bdc1-e9f56c06f955.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"208a9d36-a8cb-458c-91c6-afa2d0df4a6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"3e71aab0-887b-4c42-87a7-25a6ffb1cb8d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":91327,"FileName":"7ac23c4d-b252-4ee2-a5fe-e72ef3718889.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135316,"Name":"Zorakk the Conqueror","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"This is a graphical adventure in which you play the part of Zorakk and take control of his loyal warriors.
