Wild Joe, the southpaw flamethrower, stares in to his catcher for what seems like minutes. He nods slowly and steps into his windup. He throws a heater right under the Champ's chin. The big man falls to the ground to avoid getting hit. He sits there a second, glaring at Wild Joe, then slowly rises to his feet. The tension is as thick as peanut butter as he steps back into the box. Wild Joe's next two pitches, breaking balls, shave the corners of the plate, bringing the count to I and 2. The Champ steps out of the box and peers at the coach down at the hot corner, who touches his cap, his number, his elbow, then the tip of his nose. But the signal does not fool anyone. Everybody knows the Champ will swing for the cheap seats. Wild Joe winds up and burns a fireball across the heart of the plate. The Champ steps into it, head down, and brings his 38-ounce bat around as though it were a child's toy. Crack! The bat launches a rocket to the deepest part of the yard. Centerfielder Yazoo Sherman races toward the fence and leaps at the warning track, but he never stood a chance.

Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal \"Burst!!!\", that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is \"Use scanner\". This will bring up the scanner that looks like a radar screen and will show you the approximate location of your needed particles.

The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.\n\nThe Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwDSlC06CkM","Platform":"Atari Lynx","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Doug Smith","Publisher":"Video 61","ReleaseDate":"2008-07-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"588ad91e-e14a-47a7-b7f1-dc7fced890f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"391dfb04-8f79-47b4-93b1-153c44bf66b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"498e6287-8daa-48a5-9d88-c1108b11ab50.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"05cf6bd1-1c92-4cb5-ac3f-09af269b67c3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"11e8984e-cc18-4a6d-8ed6-450c6d251fd5.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"9c09f56b-5a7e-4bfe-bb2d-8df5c172e16d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"7194700e-9029-4efa-9527-953db9cdca00.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"03a53866-b77a-4388-922a-4e557490fa3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128037,"FileName":"b46766f3-c8dd-49d4-9aa4-e12b4068d748.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22430,"Name":"Loopz","ReleaseYear":"2004","Overview":"A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops!

At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix — a sticklike entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.\n\nThe player controls a Stix that can move around the edges of the rectangle. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to move into unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. If completed, the captured area (defined as the side opposite of where the Qix is) becomes filled in with a solid color and points are awarded. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% of the playfield (adjustable by the arcade operator to be between 50% and 90%).\n\nThe player's marker can move at two different speeds; areas drawn exclusively at the slower speed (orange-red on the screenshot shown) are worth double points. It cannot cross or backtrack along a line in progress.\n\nA life is lost if the Qix touches a line as it is being drawn or if the marker is touched by any of the Sparx – enemies that traverse all playfield edges except uncompleted lines. In addition, if the marker stops while drawing a line, a fuse will appear and burn along the uncompleted line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the player moves the marker again. The player has no defenses against the enemies and must out-maneuver them in order to survive.\n\nA meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx, and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx which can chase the player up an uncompleted line.\n\nAfter the player completes two levels, the difficulty increases by the inclusion of multiple Qixes, additional Sparx, speed increases, and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx.

The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to many other systems. Shadow of the Beast is considered revolutionary at the time, because of its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples.\n\nShadow of the Beast was followed by two sequels, Shadow of the Beast II in 1990 and Shadow of the Beast III in 1992 . A remake is in development for the PlayStation 4.\n\nA man named Aarbron is kidnapped as a child and corrupted through magic into a monstrous warrior-servant for the evil beast lord Maletoth. The creature's memory of his human life returns when he watches a man being executed, whom he later recognizes as his father.
