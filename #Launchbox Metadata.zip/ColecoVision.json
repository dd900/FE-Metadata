Three rows of targets scroll across the screen in alternating directions; these include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If a duck target crosses the bottom row without being shot, it will come to life and begin flying down toward the player. Any ducks that reach the bottom of the screen in this manner will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets or points when hit. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; these pipes and all targets must be shot in order to complete the round.\nAt the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins. Later bonus rounds add more bears to the screen.\nIn higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.","Publisher":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/WQb1cZge5HM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carnival_(arcade_game)"},"3999":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coleco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fe68c94c-6aee-4a42-b1ef-e214cb7ad9bf.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"dd575fd3-a8e8-4260-a3bf-f293d267161d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7840bf3c-df61-47de-ae27-c32e640b2dc0.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7e6fbe72-526c-4ee6-a8d3-a2db4df9eff4.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5e9c30a2-843a-4073-b61c-b58016a0c187.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b5d750e0-ebe1-4f7b-84b4-fdbd6db71672.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3f881dfa-849b-4516-9552-5bcbdb27a1ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"29c20d2f-f83c-45bb-960a-eebb66ad9215.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"798524df-3d59-4d22-b8e0-16813b0a22bd.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a414c4b8-1541-4c32-a106-9d9efa601266.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0585d2d1-18b2-4e48-b05c-5097092d1bb7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"1b734a84-4362-44d5-ae3d-5622fcbd754d.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0bb02592-6843-44c8-9606-d40d90664dbc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"88a03f4a-9921-4623-89d2-26dd8ad7decf.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b3e5dbda-9fde-455e-94a2-c65243e225c3.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bfd7ea64-0e83-483a-b88c-2de29a11723d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cd659ccd-151b-4104-ab89-ed704462cc69.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7957b7c3-065a-4b8f-b351-1dc8f757083d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cf1aee61-33ea-412b-a7a0-471aaf5a1a2c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cosmic Avenger","Overview":"Cosmic Avenger is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game.

You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy \"Droid\" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.\n\nThere is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.\n\nYou control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.\n\nBouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.","Publisher":"Micro Fun","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=js9mCF7QQoY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Omega_Race"},"4012":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ab011d95-176e-40f3-a46e-cbb0a2cc2e96.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"585a9f28-3e60-4e9b-ace2-db16b0003df0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"79788507-3daa-472f-ad13-2d07daa28a1a.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4e03cfc6-f914-4246-ab8a-1a94c0b9911a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"16b0e7cf-aace-44fd-8278-fd951debbd5e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6fcc141e-97dc-4091-b26d-3ea9a4afcbda.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"7c1ba5bb-9be3-4b89-af1e-ff6894385889.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"056a7e04-6ff2-4baa-aa29-ccb7ddea2c1b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1e34b352-18c9-49c3-854f-779118743b62.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"406e78d4-ec5b-4b8b-b932-2ac17ecfc42b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pepper II","Overview":"Pepper II is a maze game with zip!

Along the way he had to avoid ferocious man-sized dinosaurs and belligerent red-haired cavemen against whom he had no direct means of offense. The only ways to defeat the opponents were either temporary (dazing them with the flashlight) or indirect (waiting for them to be suspended on a harpoon rope to make them fall down), an element which added a certain amount of trickiness to the game, unusual for its time. Bonus items to collect along the way included fallen phoenix feathers and phoenix eggs, which granted the player invulnerability from the prehistoric denizens for a short period of time.\n\nRoc'n Rope was ported to the Atari 2600 and ColecoVision.

The arcade version game was an early example of color vector graphics and it also featured speech synthesis, both of which are not features in the Colecovision release.  \n\nThe gameplay is similar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of space that wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in Asteroids you faced pieces of rock that couldn't give chase, Space Fury instead provides alien vessels that will hunt you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4 pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting any of these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player. When one or more pieces reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your vessel. There's only one screen of space, so your tactics are limited. However your vessel is not completely basic. Provided from the beginning are three superstructures, of which you can choose one, that provide additional firepower to your ship.","Publisher":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OyfNiBXPlzs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Fury"},"4021":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0de55eac-593b-421f-a299-6d61af6f646d.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2ab1e635-cab8-4b1d-bc30-8de880b6ced3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"694e4bd5-985c-4cf7-9868-393909e4a4a4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9078a89c-ea7b-423f-adb3-191ed34d819b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"89d9cff1-0b03-4a8a-bda3-5d0cbbbdfaef.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"19ffd515-19cc-4d0b-b284-a96e0dde81f3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"212585f3-662e-4dc7-866f-6c17c5d986eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"7faabfda-5750-4b4b-a6b4-d9a733d96995.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"476f7118-fb2b-46c0-93dd-78da5d0270ac.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b6235765-218b-477b-9d92-3ae289e86bf6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"670768ee-6620-4852-bb94-00c112cdfca6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"cbf7487f-7683-49a3-9b74-3b03fe1286a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"39de39e7-09d0-4664-99de-575b244d3946.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"42d7c793-5e4e-49a0-86b8-45a1f88634f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"120f47ff-723b-4a1f-80ce-87c0beaa349f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SubRoc","Overview":"SubRoc is a first-person arcade game released in 1982 by Sega, and the first commercial game to provide a stereoscopic image to the player, using a display that delivers individual images to each eye.

While not the first game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.\n\nJohn Newcomer led the development team, which included Bill Pfutzenreuter, Jan Hendricks, Python Anghelo, Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game with cooperative two-player gameplay, but wanted to avoid a space theme, which was popular at the time. Staff worked within the technical limitations of the hardware (originally developed two years earlier for Williams' first game, Defender), excluding concepts and optimizing the visuals.\n\nThe game was well received in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay. The gameplay mechanics influenced titles by other developers. Joust was followed by a sequel four years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.","Publisher":"Atari Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joust_(video_game)"},"10117":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Parker Brothers","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b1c00d3c-c4b7-49f8-b964-80cd513ec3b1.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f99d3d33-8806-4cb6-b4bf-962eed4ac89e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9df5c304-0572-4a3d-8005-ab4d34743a55.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8bf273cf-5f0e-4798-a26f-413603a1a7b8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bbe58a65-332e-4a53-9ebe-f1a04b56293d.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ca8de56a-f984-4eec-951e-4a7a466e3d30.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e8a20040-2390-4026-9185-f126303a2552.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b61d957e-d7d3-4d07-8259-0b480810900e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7cf72973-3f71-4f20-b567-5f1d07f49f04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e230893b-601c-413e-a3a4-b6b950958017.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Gyruss","Overview":"Gyruss (ジャイラス Jairasu?) is a shoot 'em up arcade game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto and released by Konami in 1983.

The scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games is arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.\n\nGyruss is the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.\n\nThe game's background music is an electronic, uptempo arrangement of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular track is similar to \"Toccata\", a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky. Gyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits.\n\nGyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/FNdtnrSWyvo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gyruss"},"10118":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Industry Co.

Unlike its predecessor, the game features three consecutive screens for each level rather than one screen per level, with berths at the top of each of the three screens that need to be filled.","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseDate":"1984-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_hYrhy2E5w","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frogger_II:_ThreeeDeep!"},"10121":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tom Snyder Productions, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"18dda639-ac55-4726-9796-a82296598654.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9d5a226-25c1-4bd3-a775-4c60b870624c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"420a680b-1d86-4d24-823f-d4cdcdc1345a.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8b763e6c-3765-4de5-8d0a-575e2015f1ae.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7823f917-e100-41c3-9756-ffcb83ffcd20.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"831b2536-79dc-4f02-a6d1-06c7da13f78b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aff285c8-0aca-45a2-94c1-2d22eafdaa3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fraction Fever","Overview":"In Fraction Fever, the player's goal is to advance floors up to the twentieth with the help of his pogo stick and the Fraction Elevators located on each floor.

The player must choose one of about five circuits to work on in one of the ship's critical systems: Engine, Power, Communications, Life Support, and the HAL 9000. Successful power routing of a circuit makes each system slowly come on-line. It takes three powered circuits for minimum function, but four provides more leeway for success. On-Line engines and power can be activated for an orbital boost, but too long a burn will damage circuit components. HAL 9000 can power undamaged circuits you assign to him, although at a much slower pace than the player. Communications allow a powered HAL 9000 to inform you of success\/failure at powering a circuit assigned to him. Life Support gives more protection against EMPs damaging powered circuits, which require repair and repowering.","Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e5tgAtSWhNA"},"10260":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"98eaa306-4c1f-46ce-bb83-c26b34179dc3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9424e9f9-7c45-45a7-998b-df147828186e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc8cb7cb-817c-4159-ace6-5f19170a35ca.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"641450e0-c62d-401b-af07-18babe77263d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"9b6b62d0-afd4-4edf-b156-c46c7b149e79.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8d212af9-72b2-42c6-a5b7-ad820a7ca7a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d727ec76-1321-4db2-b01f-8018db968848.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3b859206-c541-4dc6-bcb8-cd7c2279caec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3995bf0c-b8a0-433f-b06e-4118c934eb8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8db89984-b355-474a-a133-35c45e3bccb4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Beamrider","Overview":"A web of iridescent blue beams engulfs Earth-Space.

If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the game level is finished.\nWhile making burgers, the player must avoid the antagonists, three types of enemies: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, stunned, crushed with a falling ingredient, or dropped by luring them onto an ingredient and then causing it to fall. In this last case, the piece will fall much farther than normal, depending on how many enemies are on it. Enemies that have been crushed or dropped return to the maze after a few seconds. Dropped enemies award larger point values than crushed ones; therefore, to obtain a high score, the player must attract more than one enemy onto an ingredient just before dropping it.\nPeter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.\nThere are six screens of increasing difficulty, with more burgers and enemies, burgers that have more parts, and\/or layouts that make it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach the ingredients. Completing all six screens takes the player back to the first one.","Publisher":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BurgerTime"},"10267":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sunrise Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"8cb553e4-53fa-4e15-974b-0cfdc6d64fb4.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d8d38d51-14cf-47de-8f8d-b84b80792911.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"11b7ee1e-e686-428a-bd9b-a0012f03298a.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4ee91725-9c04-4d06-8e0d-285556135326.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f0cd1409-34d6-4360-9311-eaca55a68b6b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Campaign '84","Overview":"The plot involves the player campaigning in the continental U.S. to become the president of the United States.

The game was designed by Ed Logg and Dona Bailey. The player defends against centipedes, spiders, scorpions and fleas, completing a round after eliminating the centipede that winds down the playing field.\n\nThe player is represented by a small, \"somewhat humanoid head\" at the bottom of the screen, later depicted as a caped, elf-like character on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200 and Atari 7800 cartridge graphics (though described as being a garden gnome in the trivia section of the cell phone interpretation). The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.\n\nThe centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. Thus, more mushrooms on the screen cause the centipede to descend more rapidly. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes four hits to destroy.\n\nIf the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment \"head\" centipedes are periodically added. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, a new centipede forms at the top of the screen. Every time a centipede is eliminated, however, the next one is one segment shorter and is accompanied by one additional, fast-moving \"head\" centipede.\n\nThe player is also menaced by other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically, leaving additional mushrooms in their path; they appear when fewer than five mushrooms are in the player movement area, though the number required increases with level of difficulty. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag fashion and occasionally eat some of the mushrooms. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and poison every mushroom they touch, but these never appear in the player movement region. A centipede touching a poisoned mushroom hurtles straight down toward the player area, then returns to normal behavior upon reaching it.\n\nA player loses a life when hit by a centipede or another enemy, such as a spider or a flea, after which any poisoned or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. Points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom.","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SFtJ4OREnq0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Centipede_(arcade_game)"},"10269":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dan Gorlin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"806a5a3c-0b02-4aa5-b3f8-4f6330e9cb3f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a575c1b7-a85f-4c3b-8dd8-dc9655745b41.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb1e8669-43ce-4e73-a557-43fc0434f21d.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"580a1dd7-9fee-40b5-aa84-ae469d994109.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Choplifter!","Overview":"Choplifter! is a side-scrolling action\/arcade game that puts you in command of an attack chopper.

While falling through one floor will destroy a white ghost, a red ghost will need to fall through two floors, and a blue ghost through three. Landing a ghost on top of another ghost below them is another way to destroy them too. Bill only has a limited amount of time to get rid of all of the ghost in order to clear a stage. The game has six different stages in all and the player starts with only four lives to get through them.\n\nThe game has four difficulty levels, with each higher difficulty increasing the speed of the ghosts except the last difficulty which simply adds an additional red ghost.","Publisher":"Bit Corp.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"10319":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coleco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"260e187c-4091-4a92-8f6a-58665acc586d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bf86ea47-568c-498e-bf32-c913b353f46b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8b952662-1cd4-490e-8787-1e9a9e4fa71c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cafdcac5-18e6-4f8d-81f9-321997442bf1.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fa67643b-1691-4b17-9cd7-55c8fe6c85f7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"The Dam Busters","Overview":"Dam Busters is an early flight simulation, set in World War II.

Up to four players compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually.\n\nThe game became somewhat notorious for the amount of wear or damage inflicted upon console controllers,[citation needed] namely the Atari 2600 version where rapid back-and-forth movement of the joystick propels the athlete down the track.\n\nThe game was later reissued simply as Decathlon by the UK budget label Firebird.[1] It was subsequently featured on the PlayStation 2 compilation Activision Anthology.","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Activision_Decathlon"},"10322":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"075fadbb-fc99-4710-9a89-1303cf795427.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"aafc7cf3-9fe4-4f88-bc51-5e2aaec34db2.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1b682929-28c1-41c1-a1ad-750ed205e1d4.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"028a0524-bba3-42ea-a80f-968e6a6ec40a.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3f5c7548-c546-41cc-a663-7c70dcf45165.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e219d8a6-1e42-4520-a8e8-08d18fc85a6b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"84cc14d1-77b7-401b-a9d1-cc8e61f8ef3b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Destructor","Overview":"Your starcruiser lands in the hostile city of Araknid to collect precious Crystals needed desperately on earth.

You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.\n\nThere are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:\nMaze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.\nMaze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow.\nMaze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence.\nMaze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once.\nMaze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.\n\nYou start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.","Publisher":"Starpath Corporation","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Escape_from_the_Mindmaster"},"10327":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sydney Development Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3e93cfa7-4801-4676-a2fa-0b665da3819d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"49b916e7-a357-4292-8312-c9514462dd5a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6979e3be-b876-43a5-95da-8238188515c2.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b55f984d-0943-4522-a187-969ff0073dde.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"12e46ca3-9983-4f22-b813-09d3e064755f.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5b4c3a49-f1f9-4c71-8f46-7d4cb00d8f2d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3266c3d5-c676-45e1-bad3-f66131391aef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d11e47ec-1ee2-41b5-b304-2dbbe481dd53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dca3fd4e-6e04-42ac-814e-b7ce1eb7a915.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"63acddac-5c83-40b5-8785-5beaea93c344.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Evolution","Overview":"Evolution is an arcade style action game with six levels where you need to evolve from an amoeba to a human.

Jumpman's game run-speed can be chosen by the player, with faster speeds being riskier but providing greater opportunity to earn bonus points.","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseDate":"1984-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"10345":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito America Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"80030ade-7c8d-4187-b95a-5fe58a5b887c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"099cfeb9-ead2-4241-9791-70ffd0d30045.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eaacd285-a440-41f7-9737-52be20bc0806.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"608321c7-7204-4db8-88bb-f9dc6be42865.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"17d243f4-ab91-4149-a173-11ae8ca9a018.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"69a64325-4c74-4841-8194-9b2d02611ac4.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2d57bc43-4722-40c0-b38c-f219a876cd7a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"cc6bd9a2-c8da-470b-8004-78b58632b145.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6b9ba7ec-10e6-49d6-99bc-f7262f5fbc33.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2d9ed7e3-e38e-41b7-a39b-f115a8ff2b75.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jungle Hunt","Overview":"Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived. If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!\n\nThe first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom? The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?\n\nGameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river\/crocodile phase). The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/DauKE57kMKw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jungle_Hunt"},"10346":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ken Uston Blackjack-Poker","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coleco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"47a63357-d4b7-4432-9dec-ab34fd21b8c3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9af88239-6b69-4716-ac74-0b6e93595636.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"686bf1cc-f074-4e2b-ba58-fd5d068881ef.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8700e945-6d13-4c99-95c0-4aaae68bade4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1a778f0f-5343-48cb-b39b-446a250c135b.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"653bed13-095a-4e7f-ae87-39a7c69fd97a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2d0937da-45e1-4ea4-be30-4f7f99f9f25e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2895f443-c9b1-4b0d-9eb6-d6b00932f8cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"65396d7b-75e2-44e8-83de-a498eee38fc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ken Uston Blackjack\/Poker","Overview":"Feeling Lucky?

The game takes place in a castle filled with platforms and ladders, some of which can be flipped from one platform to another. The player controls Mr. Do as he collects cherries by using a hammer to knock out blocks that contain them from the various platforms. Empty holes left by the knocked-out blocks serve as traps for the monsters - if a monster falls into a hole, the player can then defeat it by causing a block above the monster to fall on top of it. If the player takes too long to complete a level, the monsters transform into faster, more difficult forms that occasionally multiply. The game advances to the next level when all cherries on the level have been collected or all enemies have been defeated. The player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by a monster, and the game ends when the player runs out of lives. The game is an example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien, Lode Runner, Boomer's Adventure in Asmik World, and Space Panic.\n\nAs in Mr. Do!, the player can earn an extra life by collecting all of the letters from the word \"EXTRA\". Regular monsters can be changed into monsters bearing the EXTRA letters by collecting all three keys distributed around the playfield and then picking up a magic shield from the top floor. Monsters in this state are easier to defeat than normal; a simple hammer strike will do the job. After a brief interval, they change back into their normal forms. The game also offers a bonus credit for collecting a rare diamond that appears on the playfield at random intervals.\n\nThe cherry blocks are absent from Mr. Do Vs. Unicorns and early revisions of Mr. Do's Castle. Instead, blocks that are not keys or skulls at the start of a stage will be fill blocks (those left behind when unicorns fall into holes and are left alone for a time). Because of this, there are only three ways to complete a level in this version, versus the four ways to complete levels in Mr. Do's Castle. In addition, in these early revisions, the fill blocks change colors every two stages.","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mr._Do%27s_Castle"},"10411":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"53b2afd6-080d-44f7-8386-466fd949b463.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d3516c45-77a4-43d9-a6c4-87cdc26f16ca.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5062df0f-a725-46ff-880b-3f63a1cc64ac.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"985d9608-adb9-4400-90a4-3c1b9fe8054e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7c35eb2d-702e-49c7-a250-41ddc2e9e752.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fb361ac3-d0c1-42df-a1d8-8ed786700990.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cd1781db-dada-4da5-a8c6-090f068cd623.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e09c31c0-0b91-4f4b-bfa4-f5b23dc35311.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pitfall II: Lost Caverns","Overview":"You play Pitfall Harry searching for the Raj diamond, his niece Rhonda, her cat Quickclaw and a variety of treasures somewhere in the Andes.

Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge!

Hepburn: Pakkuman?) is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan in May 1980.[1][2] It was created by Japanese video game designer Toru Iwatani. It was licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway and released in October 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, and an icon of 1980s popular culture.[6][7][8][9] Upon its release, the game—and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives—became a social phenomenon[10] that yielded high sales of merchandise and inspired a legacy in other media, such as the Pac-Man animated television series and the top-ten hit single \"Pac-Man Fever\".[11] Pac-Man was popular in the 1980s and 1990s and is still played as of the 2010s.\n\nWhen Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, in particular Space Invaders and Asteroids. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre.[12] Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time.[13] It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time,[14] having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[15][16]\n\nThe character has appeared in more than 30 officially licensed game spin-offs,[17] as well as in numerous unauthorized clones and bootlegs.[18] According to the Davie-Brown Index, Pac-Man has the highest brand awareness of any video game character among American consumers, recognized by 94 percent of them.[19] Pac-Man is one of the longest running video game franchises from the golden age of video arcade games. It is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[20] and New York's Museum of Modern Art.[21]","Publisher":"Atari Games","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gtkeaM9LEJ8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pac-Man"},"107229":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Digital Press","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"93a27172-fabf-4ddd-a251-8c7599c5f667.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"6f7ac181-58dd-4179-bec8-13ce78c0f589.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"79db7f86-75e0-41ca-9f08-c6e432d2de6e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3b7a586-c0d5-4ee7-a396-3a376db0c528.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"52e614ca-0cf8-4d1e-b140-cff6b78d0b59.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"50024d0e-c1e0-4d22-9d34-e57c88871e38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"83f05903-6427-4cf3-8eea-a92ca4871077.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"9cd5b9ae-8f03-4d5e-b2ad-1f80c3a4c850.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"14635a66-82eb-46b9-ab16-6aa6f0f858fe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2b889cf0-b32c-43a1-aabe-2f65724301a7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ms. Space Fury","Overview":"A joke on Ms. Pac-Man, only for the Sega arcade classic Space Fury, this is a homebrew effort.

An enormous laser-eyed space serpent is coiled around the mountain, and you have to take it down single-handedly. Once See the videoyou’ve baked the snake, you land your sled on the surface and have a shootout with Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus. Once you’ve beaten them back, you can explore the underground caverns, collecting their instruments of evil and exchanging fire with them again. When you escape from their maze, you advance to the next level and begin the fight anew. (North American Philips \/ Probe 2000, 1983 – unreleased) This Colecovision adaptation of the Odyssey2 game (now there’s a phrase you’re never going to see again), based on a less-than-blockbuster-successful series of comics and action figures, adds more depth to the game than the dear old Odyssey ever could’ve managed. But it’s hard to tell how much depth, as the game was never completed. The “snake” screen, though it’s much more impressive visually than its counterpart on the Odyssey2, is just plain boring. The O2 edition of Power Lords also forced you to dodge earthbound meteors and an “artificial black hole” within the volcano that could drag you to your doom if you got on a horizontal line of sight with it when it opened. On the Colecovision, all you have to contend with are enemy vehicles and a slow-moving snake. It takes more time than effort to clear this screen, and it’s ultimately a bit boring. The other screens, which aren’t even hinted at in the Odyssey2 version of the game, are also a bit tedious – enemy A.I. and combat programming obviously weren’t finished when the game was abandoned. You can exchange fire with your interestingly-animated opponents, but sometimes they just stop firing and disappear. Convenient, sure, but not terribly exciting. “Probe 2000” was an imprint – akin to Atari’s “Atarisoft” division – opened by North American Philips to release games for hardware other than the Odyssey2, which was by now firmly into its twilight. The only game actually released by Probe 2000 was War Room, programmed by Bob “RoSHa” Harris (who created Killer Bees on the O2). Probe 2000’s next release would’ve been either Power Lords or the impressive RPG Lord Of The Dungeon (which was left in limbo because its battery-backed-up cartridge, capable of saving the player’s position, was an idea that just wouldn’t be practical until the NES era). The intellectual property rights to Pink Panther had been snagged by N.A.P. for the Odyssey2 and other systems, but the only version of that game that has ever surfaced has been an incredibly rare Atari 2600 prototype. N.A.P. ultimately got out of the game business, leaving both the Odyssey2 and Probe 2000 behind.","Publisher":"NAP Consumer Electronics","ReleaseType":"Unreleased"},"133380":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Super DK Junior"},{"AlternateName":"Donkey Kong jr","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"794d30d1-1113-4ad5-86be-04201321bacd.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"07dbdb34-f04a-4171-b857-420ba20d7c06.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"dfbc52ae-dfba-4565-ac10-d40971824c63.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"deee8515-da40-42f8-a53f-0f95ac095b61.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb311778-de51-411d-b664-710913b8cce5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cf805621-3e76-4881-ac7f-1ba613a872cc.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Super DK! Junior","Overview":"Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's father.\n\nAlong the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.\n\nJunior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.\n\nIn the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nLike the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.","Publisher":"Coleco Industries, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donkey_Kong_Jr."},"133381":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"e9a7ee26-a1d7-4b8e-b574-21f29d7024d4.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0993667e-7a8a-4b6b-8c17-387c547692b3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7cc1ea83-c2c7-468a-85ee-ba83a96c9226.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"33a85014-0599-4d22-816d-96896fa489fc.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cba4d487-b381-4e82-bfef-51cb8b9fd290.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dec4d0e2-a1a9-4e3b-bcf1-6d989aa8eabf.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tunnels & Trolls","Overview":"Tunnels and Trolls is an Action game, published by Coleco, which was released in 1983."},"133382":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"8bc0fb91-b970-4bce-88f7-32820695b625.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3a33c313-9758-4465-8d85-f4706bbb3be3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9a851c89-f089-44ee-8a5f-2ce23f5bc390.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5797f8fe-2b9f-46f0-ab35-c772e34892a2.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4d49b43d-9d72-4823-a5dd-3845306fb5e3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1ab0c5c0-4e27-4e90-b68e-7cc191383804.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Video Hustler","Overview":"With an overhead view of the table, you play a billiards variant called \"Pocket Ball\" with just six object balls.\nImprecise control over the aim and velocity of your shots.\n\nYou'll discover the exicetiment of ball colliding.\nThe silence and concentration of the billiard room, as well as the enthusiasm of the players will all be there for you."},"133383":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Yolk's on You"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"401e61a4-5a8e-4f29-962b-da1de5318c42.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6b836f43-855c-49ab-96e2-8a749276a2c5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b1052459-19e8-4229-bd82-f1a33d11cfcc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b90792f7-39bc-4f20-992c-6741b0fdf6ce.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3acfffe3-4c4c-4ca5-80d6-068a2a2a0f9f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4179931f-fd74-42df-846d-61a4ac9d86ad.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Yolk's on You","Overview":"The Yolk's on You was a prototype game developed by 20th Century Fox for the ColecoVision system in 1983.

Along the way, he must use the building's elevator and escalator systems to move from floor to floor and avoid or kill the enemy agents trying to stop him. After picking up all the documents, Otto can escape to the basement and drive away in a waiting car to end the level.\n\nThe player controls consist of a four-position joystick and separate buttons to control jumping and firing. Otto can move left and right, jump, duck, and fire up to three shots at a time from his pistol. While Otto is in an elevator, the player can push up or down to send him to a higher or lower floor; however, Otto cannot duck as long as he is inside. He can run or jump across an empty shaft as long as the elevator is above him, and can ride on its roof but not control its motion or cross to the other side. The player can push up or down to make Otto ride an escalator.\n\nIf Otto tries to leave the building without collecting all the documents, he will be transported to the highest floor that still has an unopened red door and must work his way back down. In addition, if he takes too long to clear a level, an alarm will sound; the enemy agents then become more aggressive, and the elevators will be slower to respond to the player's joystick movements.\n\nEach building contains a section in which the lights are out, making it harder to see approaching enemies. On other floors, Otto can temporarily disable the lights by shooting one of the overhead fixtures. Otto can kill enemy agents by shooting them, jump-kicking them at close range, dropping a light fixture on their heads, or crushing them with an elevator. If he is shot or crushed, or if he falls down an open shaft, the player loses one life.\n\nThe background music is the same for all levels and only changes when the hidden time limit expires. As Otto lands on the first building's rooftop at the start of the game, Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2, popularly known as Funeral March, is briefly heard."},"168173":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"0c974321-2c61-4c1c-8b3f-cb19f8c99769.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4e95c893-1c70-4351-8c5d-73601fafec11.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6cc18c1-56c7-4b80-8c46-4354012b6f21.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3ab02b1a-c8c5-4fc3-992e-831a5f6bd03c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"59fbd196-f713-4878-a17a-f72b2fbefc6d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Super DK!","Overview":"Super Donkey Kong for ColecoVision is a hacked version of the enhanced game made for Coleco's Adam computer. Because of what was likely a means of cost-cutting by Coleco, the version of Donkey Kong they \"gave away\" with the system was scaled down to fit in about half as much memory as the ColecoVision can handle. When they did the Adam computer version of the game, they pulled out all the stops and made is much truer to the arcade. A few years back I discovered an in-house version of Donkey Kong and I titled it Super DK. This version uses all of the available memory space on the ColecoVision and while some minor bugs had to be worked out, I was able to get it to run on a stand-alone ColecoVision system.\n\nThe main difference you will notice is the addition of the intermission sequences. While these were present in the arcade version of the game, Coleco elected to omit them in the cartridge version. They make for a more arcade-like experience but add nothing to the game.\n\nOne extra level is present in this version over the released cartridge. While it will come up and seemingly let you play it, something called sprite collision is not implemented which means you cannot get killed by any of the nasties chasing you. You also can't pick up any of the bonus items. You can navigate the screen and make your way to the top (with ease I might add) and complete the level, but there is no challenge whatsoever.\n\nAll the regular levels of Donkey Kong are here as you would expect and they are exactly the same as they are in your cartridge."},"168175":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"498ae24f-05d9-4e2c-bf07-9d8596956ee8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6b42021a-be09-41b0-91ab-cd2d47dcea8b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed3accf0-18d7-4d47-86a2-c281b3e1327a.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a716dc47-0e5c-4416-b5b9-84b46038c6a1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f0f42851-a6e5-450b-ba1e-615b1ebf0833.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7bbce2a9-94ac-44d9-8403-67747fa4663b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"14204af4-6fde-47b4-a3fc-281e7a7c27f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Black Onyx","Overview":"Only the best of adventurers can hope to find the Black Onyx!

You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously.

In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering."},"183002":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"b4d75a35-33fd-433a-88c6-4557facb1af3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"11dedbd2-ef65-432c-bfb9-479433034065.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c768850c-7c20-4f36-be41-6793472028b8.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"46a12c04-99b2-42c1-be66-aa08922cf443.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ab103a5c-6ffc-4309-8346-2d1a630eada8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c7487b88-503a-493c-8d79-cc109300d3ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Ninja Princess","Overview":"She's not just a princess!

An Air Genie will try to blow him off, and he also has to jump off at the right moment to get onto a ramp leading to the next level. Skull Hallway: Dirk must evade or fend off creatures like skeletons, slimes and bats emerging from passageways. The Burning Ropes: Dirk must swing across chasms on ropes, being fast enough so the rising flames won't engulf him from behind. The Weapons Room: Weapons and armor come to life and attack Dirk: he can only survive through well-timed sidesteps or weapon slashes. Ramps and Giddy Goons: Dirk must jump from ramp to ramp quickly before they disappear behind him, and he also has to take out the goons standing in the way with his sword. The Tentacle Room: Similar to scenes two and five, Dirk must again evade or kill creatures in a room, who emerge from the ceiling and floor. The Second Disk: a reprise of the first scene, deeper in the dungeons. The Deadly Checkerboard: A dangerous game against the Phantom Knight. The Knight can teleport around the board at will and will turn a line of squares in front of him into deadly traps. Dirk must get close to the Knight and strike him down with a series of sword hits.
