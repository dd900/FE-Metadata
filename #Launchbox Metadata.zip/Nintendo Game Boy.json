The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J0aHRo69IM","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Atlus","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"7aa75078-5448-4a09-aab8-ff6622fdffa2.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"bc077da4-dacd-42b6-875e-b360f952cb59.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"cdbc02de-10a2-40e8-9b81-c07bc7ded712.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"644d39cb-13b3-485e-b8a1-0a734380bd0f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"52fcbee8-5030-4142-933a-a1df734df53e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"d3d76412-37f0-4ca8-8ce0-0b295f23615b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"8467d7c2-6400-4b3d-987a-118b8c73224a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"40dac7ad-dcbd-4145-9ff7-94695fcdb5fd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"201833c9-8eaf-48c5-bf79-06a2e035dd8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18289,"FileName":"2dda1764-7906-4c97-9e3a-2f36ab406824.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18289,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Boy II","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":125777,"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz is a Trivia game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125777,"FileName":"4bf0d95d-bec0-49f4-9d8e-f5e24de91e75.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125786,"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 2 is a Trivia game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125786,"FileName":"30f9336e-5769-4902-88b7-13cf557c5612.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125787,"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 3: Champion Taikai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"America Oudan Ultra-Quiz Part 3 is a Miscellaneous game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1992.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF_NuOH298Y","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125787,"FileName":"2bbabdda-0845-4150-84b6-8b2cfa248a23.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125787,"FileName":"83641184-6a21-4e0d-9ce8-0c91334eadb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125787,"FileName":"135f3e6a-64eb-4ad0-84f8-f9d43600496b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125787,"FileName":"f7b79e9e-1db7-4bdc-9cd1-4c37cc55cafe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125787,"FileName":"31f253a5-7e01-4d7c-8277-95e6b6888060.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":125787,"AlternateName":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 3","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":125788,"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 4","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 4 is a Trivia game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1993.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125788,"FileName":"e2b1b5b3-2080-478b-a0e6-b1d675de43b8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125788,"FileName":"2e866f95-3658-4e44-b0c1-f88b74a3cc47.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125788,"FileName":"3454f1d8-d72b-4d7c-9d1b-b8489c9c15c3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":26080,"Name":"Amida","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Amida is a Japanese ladder climbing puzzle video game.

When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.\n\nThe player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.\n\nAsteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.

The platforms come in three heights which are indicated by their size - the bigger, the higher. Landing on a platform creates a lot of force and either causes the block to crack and, if it has a question mark on it, gives a power up (extra time or points).\n\n\n\nThe levels loop until the player finds a heart hidden in the question mark blocks - but landing on a cracked platform causes it to give way. Of course there are also enemies which have to be avoided or shot with the gun.

But there was a stowaway onboard, Vargen! He's kidnappped Skalman, and without him there is now way for Bamse and Lille Skutt to get back to their own time.\n\nCan you help Bamse find Skalman and clear all the dangers on the way? It won't be easy and Bamse is gonna need all the help he can get.\n\nBamse, the strongest bear in the world, is a popular Swedish cartoon figure created by Rune Andréasson in 1962. This is his first appearance in a video game. The game was exclusively created for the Swedish market.\n\nThe story goes, that Skalman has invented a time machine and together with Bamse and Lille Skutt they travel 75 million years back in time to the age of the dinosaurs. But the mischievous Vargen sneaks along and kidnaps Skalman to his \"doomed castle\". Bamse must now free his friend so they can get back to their own time again.\n\nBamse is not an original game. Instead it is a re-skinned version of Baby T-Rex by the same developer. This explains why the settings of the game appears out of context with very little to do with the original cartoon. It also suffers from translation errors and contain left overs from the original game which do not fit in.\n\nIt is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There are a total of 4 \"worlds\", each with 3 stages and a final boss stage. The gameplay is fast paced, with slides and skateboards for added speed. You can find small jars of \"Dunderhonung\" and bowling balls to throw at the enemies. There are also power-ups to replenish health and obtain extra lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpi5cZnsKS0","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Beam Software","Publisher":"Laser Beam Entertainment","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"5f49327f-6588-418b-8c6c-ed8c03b5009c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"036a2436-5acc-4ae5-b19e-8e21c919b93a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"d457de1c-2792-4b05-bbbf-685208901c27.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"9af20316-c20c-4967-878d-cb94cbc3701e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Sweden"},{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"490ffa9c-39e5-4890-946c-bb9eaa977844.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"85a013b0-48f2-493a-98d4-f0296869976f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Sweden"},{"DatabaseID":26553,"FileName":"3eb53d90-7f73-413f-8ae4-dc57d2c64aab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Sweden"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":102430,"Name":"Banishing Racer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Banishing Racer allows the player to take control of an animated car against numerous enemies that must be jumped on to defeat, in a fashion similar to Super Mario Land.

Each player brings their own unique stats and abilities to the game as you work your way through progressively more challenging teams.\n\nThis portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely based on the title for the original NES. In this scaled down version Major League teams are replaced with two teams representing the East and West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and a Video Link cable players can go head to head - although each player will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included.\n\nPlay in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and hitting ability.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KnLLww4AmM","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"98433c4a-5d08-4703-9af2-32c737b8e837.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"9ffaf274-bf64-4822-812e-880ff7c3d508.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"42c20cf2-edcb-416f-b0d7-36990c9f26ba.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"5884b03a-7690-4538-b6f3-b54c31ae4217.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"33944ce5-6207-47d3-b3f9-9c50800167d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"db3eb2a6-2910-4247-a12d-26652eba035b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"335d30da-1cf7-4a04-ad6f-d24b922b61b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"5a21cb20-6760-4a6c-b3d1-a6ce99c4f157.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"43cfa3d5-cfb5-465c-910c-816a766d4791.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"b748a89a-6042-4706-b9dd-11c7d018a03d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"4f175f4e-1fd7-41ca-a705-9a9422bbd793.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"f0a5efe2-7247-401f-96b1-e3a05a45bf4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"FileName":"18ecc53b-ef7a-4ec8-b9fa-a07d969dbc73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":3154,"AlternateName":"Baseball Kids","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":3154,"AlternateName":"Bases Loaded for Game Boy","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":126196,"Name":"Bass Fishing Tatsujin Techou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bass Fishing Tatsujin Techou is a Sports game, published by Starfish, which was released in Japan in 1996.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Starfish","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126196,"FileName":"3e8d1592-8207-44bf-8c11-172e7f6c3e7d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18297,"Name":"Batman Forever","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"The Real Game Begins!

Rather, in Battle Dodge Ball, each character has a specific amount of HP. Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match.\n\nAlong with HP, this trends into a general statistics system with several other stats. If you win a match, you gain a variable amount of experience points, and 15 experience points if you lose a match. You can level up your stats and make each match significantly easier over time.\n\nYour team has two players each. The Leader has the ability to make special attacks, and is generally more powerful. The follower, however, has two 'forms' or copies or whatever - an infielder who plays on the main arena, and an outfielder who stands on the lines behind the enemy side of the arena and can catch long passes and grab balls that enemies dodge. The outfielder can also return balls to you, but also throw it at the enemy players, making him potentially dangerous. Stats for the outfielder are upgraded separately from his infield counterpart.\n\nOnce you play a full 10 rounds against each of the five opposing teams, the game ends.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7448ZIw5dlU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Sun L","Publisher":"Banpresto","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"894297db-ffeb-47fb-ab1f-d6a01e412b54.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"f5220846-15b4-4f49-b753-e31dd403f268.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"6c554320-02de-4af7-9f88-1704fcadadc2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"064b95be-5018-4bc8-a787-f6ed8fd96f16.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"369d79af-4a67-4616-b78e-7b4540671e22.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"5cf6ee61-af36-4ec9-b7c8-858bf757b576.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"ae07a01d-a28f-4f09-83d3-e9151ba270e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119036,"FileName":"b65216c3-a872-4dfc-94f4-9f002f2b863d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123799,"Name":"Battle of Kingdom","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Battle of Kingdom is a 1991 Game Boy video game that was jointly created by the Meldac, Live Planning, and the Lenar companies. It was only released for a Japanese market.\nThe object is to lead a kingdom through various battles using the format of a traditional board game. In order to advance to the next battle, players must destroy at least 92% of the monsters on the battlefield. Each stage represents a battle in a high fantasy campaign to save the world from an unknown evil force (that resides in a skull castle). As players progresses to the right side of the screen killing monsters from the enemy forces, the probability of winning the entire battle shows up in percentage. Players are unable to automatically attack the opponent if the number of points on the attack power meter becomes depleted. Attacking manually does not deduct attack points from the player's statistics, however.\nMonsters like slimes can face off against each other for control of the playing field in the lower levels of the game while players are allowed in the upper levels of the game to summon the King's loyal army of archers, knights, horsemen and magicians. All these creatures must be bought in card form before being allowed to join the battlefield. Even the leader of each respective kingdom is expected to fight. The player's creatures can either fight, run away from battle, or cast a magic spell. All creatures have hit points, attack points, and special points.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ssP8K6DNmY","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Lenar","Publisher":"Meldac","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":123799,"FileName":"32222bec-28f8-4cb3-a0c5-547339ce7655.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123799,"FileName":"f5527cd1-9028-42d6-aa14-670b49c213be.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123799,"FileName":"ab8ea2ad-b855-447c-9018-5c4859aae992.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":123799,"FileName":"f291bd12-c345-41dc-aa37-2f4fc28538e2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":119037,"Name":"Battle Pingpong","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Battle Ping Pong the player can battle against ten AI enemies in a table tennis game.

The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\n\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\n\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.\nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG_nU-wfw2w","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Arc System Works","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"109f0cd6-2612-4a9f-bfa8-2063cb2b9c89.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"ad282c27-0204-4994-8bef-766c247b4391.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"8ae21263-2491-4758-8bc7-941de3c5a231.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"051166ba-20b0-49e7-b107-e0c9ddb9aa20.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"9e5adc56-ee28-48b7-874f-bcd6f85957a3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"6f351acf-3b6c-430e-ba23-733c71be3694.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"a8510998-25ad-4969-8d0a-f40081bd199d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"b42b8c0b-b8e7-44b2-97cd-c943844a033a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"6903f699-c27b-445d-9832-202a0e8e159e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"02351aff-da80-44a4-bebe-719e1eaa13f8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"2f5492b1-c68f-4793-ad46-4820a9ed5f2a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"5cc412e6-7d03-4476-b95b-a3f9380fc58c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"4f70207a-e573-4a51-a4b6-248b984f670e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"52b8c939-f8c5-481a-905f-f569d28d48be.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18784,"FileName":"f00e0aec-f66a-43a9-9409-8b20399737e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18785,"Name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sailor Moon R was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1994.\n\nIn this game, the player could play using \"story mode\" or \"arcade mode.\" In story mode, the player began play with Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon, then Chibiusa, then the Inner Senshi.

Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ9HVfBDWqc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Ultra Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"6fce0f2b-9529-4a99-8815-6268552b8c29.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"69013408-6560-48c3-a3db-c02c261b7134.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"ce7b89a3-db05-4f27-be36-24f0f9f882c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"935b995b-dfd9-4daf-af58-d5fe7ed9845e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"f513354f-a9d2-4261-8f9b-41499ca0b916.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"ce8cd487-9a28-4d2e-acad-54f16781218c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"f4b2c938-ccd6-4a3f-b20e-75fef07c6aeb.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"0fc5bb1b-d8f8-42a3-8e25-4bab5bbb8373.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"12ec7e5c-a156-4cfa-9714-952ee5ad0f1b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"b9d6b3e8-f07c-46ef-81da-ae81a7a71fcd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"fa460a04-129f-492b-8053-c500ba8cf469.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18308,"FileName":"9a488649-6c6c-4031-97ac-abb82d705ad8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18308,"AlternateName":"Konamic Ice Hockey","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":2647,"Name":"Blaster Master Boy","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"You thought the world would be free of radioactive threats from the underground world after the events of the original Blaster Master yet for reasons unknown several radioactive hotspots sprout from the ground all over the world.

Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank.\n\nThe goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Tonkin House","Publisher":"Tonkin House","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"15433039-ce95-4a1a-8f83-703792af8e9f.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"f1515079-93b6-4cb6-b526-f8d819609742.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"a144f489-9567-4083-bfb4-fa73cf0932fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"80b44f65-4cb9-47fd-9a2d-ae5dcf5419b2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"be8015d8-7921-41c6-aa8f-6346da0bdb6d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"4687821e-4437-42ee-be64-516e0d7b8d40.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"7a818117-217d-407d-8dc9-ff0a9a534daa.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"bfa5aaf4-ec42-4b33-b3ad-444622ef5890.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119038,"FileName":"48d071dc-5f7c-412a-9fd0-16adb8b3362e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18320,"Name":"Bo Jackson: Two Games in One","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Let Bo guide you through the Majors in the hardest hitting, fastest pitching baseball game that you can hold in your hands.

If two pieces meet on the same square, they fight on special screen with a playing-card roulette. Depending on the cards that each unit gets they will do damage to an opponent. Different units have different health points and also different cards, for example, some units have more propensity to getting the instantly killing joker card.\n\nSome units are able to cast attack or defense spells.

Every maze has monsters patrolling the depths of the labyrinth. Help Catgirl and Catboy push around huge blocks to bridge a path to yet another maze, or topple a block a few stories over the pursuing monsters. If you make a mistake, simply use the rewind function and travel back in time to correct it.

Be the architect of the underground labyrinth and make your own games of intricate puzzles.\n\nWhether you choose to be a maze builder or a maze solver, we know you can help Catboy and Catgirl land on their feet.\n\nCatrap (known as Pitman in Japan) is a puzzle game in which the player maneuvers the player, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level. Advancement can prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to overcome all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve the problem is through trial and error. A player may try one combination of maneuvers by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find himself trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try again in a different way until he finds the solution that enables him to access all of the baddies to knock them off the screen. Trial and error seems to make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes. The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO-ig99eLXY","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"ASK Kodansha","Publisher":"Asmik","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"bb0eee13-63af-4a22-a3ac-88e85495c599.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"658f4b5c-37b3-4ffc-8a87-fcc0f478986b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"4ae7728f-b9a7-48b3-9739-d6bc85941eea.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"c283ccd8-5f3b-43e3-99c7-4b44776c9b3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"a87db6cc-2ed2-49eb-9ff6-24340084c1cb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"21c3b176-a9a0-453e-88d3-41ad1f8e955f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"46fa478d-0eef-4deb-8387-eba6021ba343.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"9d4f9df6-8d65-437c-bed2-e7f562ef2df7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"02a1b4c1-46d6-4b2b-a593-40b6e146c4be.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"9006f2d1-fd48-4cf7-b637-f382fe62f612.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18585,"FileName":"60df422d-abd9-494f-8d68-faac0e1696c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18585,"AlternateName":"Pitman","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":26548,"Name":"Cave Noire","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You have come to the northern village Karuzu.

It is a land where your progress will be severely tested by the challenge of myriad shapes and blocks. It will take the art of Daedalus and the power of your mind to solve the confounding riddles of the blocks. To be beaten is ordinary, to achieve victory is an art.\n\nThe game is essentially a series of 36 jigsaw puzzles with Tetris-like pieces known as pentominos that must be assembled into a specific shape. The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.\n\nAfter completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcSCwySKcQg","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Vic Tokai","Publisher":"Vic Tokai","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"37871f94-0398-44ef-bb3f-dffb523de2cf.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"589c9948-bd88-44fb-951f-1888b28f4bd3.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"96e4d9ae-4e67-4d32-970f-263a48265d86.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"952ae51b-fb17-4f66-af31-f345ef342b78.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"e0b12d3d-332c-4f3d-94c6-374dde64731e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"4acc9521-a9a2-45fe-9a78-d30fbd75dbd2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"9927b986-733c-472b-83d7-9cdd9561577f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"1b381a76-90bb-459c-bafa-8530de87dc2e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"7dad4c95-c07a-4d10-b910-efd985f76c29.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"b1a7ee2e-0ada-44b1-8305-d5d05eb609ec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"4b9a0b2d-c529-4e75-9e3a-2a79b4f9788f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"d3483283-7535-447b-8c1c-b5887197291e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"dcf0d22a-66e9-4b51-b617-55bb38fe2394.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"e6bb3b5d-6078-4954-8aba-366fbe93c6b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18611,"FileName":"0161cef7-d6ee-4a91-88ec-bfa6ec0d3eda.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18611,"AlternateName":"Daedalean Opus","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18611,"AlternateName":"Bouken!

Mow down the other cars in your way and you accumulate points.\n\nEach time you overtake another car you are presented with other challenges and opportunities: Capture a flying bottle of nitro and you increase your speed. Capture a runaway tire and you increase your steering ability. Catch up with the soaring clock and time stands still. Catch a bomb and you have fire power! The obstacles are tough and without acquiring these powers it will become impossible to simply maneuver around them and win!\n\nSurvival of the fittest is the golden rule in DEAD HEAT SCRAMBLE!\n\nPlayers must choose between a dune buggy, a sand rail vehicle, and the incredible off-road truck. All races are strictly against the clock while the driver navigates through blockades on the road and other drivers that want to defeat the player. All of the ten courses must be unlocked in a linear fashion; all the races take place in a tube. Few power-ups exist in them game; including a chance to increase the player's nitro boost.\n\nThere are ten stages in the entire game. No penalties are given for bumping into the other drivers; unlike real life. Each course is in the shape of a half-pipe.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4CFqePncE","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Copya System","Publisher":"Electro Brain","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"5a66db8e-3c2c-49c6-99bb-9d38e66da8c1.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"9ebf3482-5012-449c-ba45-c73d0d79fbc2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"f51846da-21ab-42f4-8eb4-57cd1dc2b2fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"912b072b-c632-4573-8b03-2331bdbe9fc2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"6e4f271d-0d47-4548-9d34-b4205cc93ac2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"518b4d6e-cb34-44b4-9e54-cea346dbaca3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"9db926ca-a418-4a07-9587-ea0d546926b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"bed56801-df36-455d-8ac9-5da1fcb47722.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"eaeec078-296b-4059-a2a7-becd3e6af965.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18614,"FileName":"a65def34-ec0c-4e17-9dc2-599d987d8f01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182054,"Name":"Deadeus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Deadeus is an indie horror game developed by -IZMA- for the original Game Boy, using Chris Maltby’s GB Studio engine and featuring music by Stuart Busby.\n\nThe game centers around a boy who has a prophetic nightmare telling him everyone in his village will die in three days, so he sets out to investigate how to save them, if at all.\n\nDeadeus features 11 endings and no direct path to follow, leaving it up to the player to decide the best course of action.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NGY7Techpc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Horror","Developer":"-IZMA-","Publisher":"-IZMA-","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182054,"FileName":"2c5feae6-1b78-4dee-8508-01149b255dee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182054,"FileName":"22c30cfb-98f6-4958-9453-ffd0509e314c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182054,"FileName":"25667065-cdb4-4a99-81ad-9082c9d82244.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182054,"FileName":"d544a422-9b3b-4bba-82a6-4c57d80b2490.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182054,"FileName":"26b8b68f-7b93-4460-816c-1736f1094140.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182054,"FileName":"72d6aaf1-2b0a-4542-935e-d11309be5321.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":173225,"Name":"Death Planet","ReleaseYear":"2019","Overview":"An evil glactic empire has constructed a moon-sized battle station = the Death Planet.\n\nEquipped with a giant laser cannon, it has the power to destroy entire planets.

Big Boy Caprice had escaped from prison and within hours a crime wave had hit Chicago the likes of which he'd never seen. It seemed that all the filth of the city had crawled out from beneath some slimy rock...the Brow, Pruneface, Flattop, and the rest of their ruthless cohorts were on the rampage again. But worst of all, that dirty dealing Big Boy had kidnapped Tess Trueheart!! Suddenly Tracy's two-way wrist radio broke the silence. \"Calling Dick Tracy! Calling Dick Tracy!\" He sprang from behind his desk and burst through the squad room door shouting, \"O.K. boys, let's go! This could be our lucky break!\"\n\nThe game's introduction shows that Big Boy has escaped from the state penitentiary and kidnapped Tess, Tracy's love interest. The gameplay itself is purely level-based platforming, foregoing the overhead driving sequences of its NES counterpart.\n\nStylistically, the Game Boy version bears a strong resemblance to the side-scrolling mode of the NES version. Dick Tracy can punch and use the same weapons (hand gun, Tommy gun, tear gas), as well as grenades (which will instantly kill all non-boss enemies on the screen). This game also shares some common music with the NES version. Each of the five levels contains 12 hidden pieces of a photograph used to solve a puzzle at the end of each level.\n\nAt the end of each level, Dick Tracy would fight one of the antagonists from the film, including Shoulders, Flattop, and Pruneface). After defeating the boss, the player would need to solve the twelve-piece puzzle using the pieces found throughout the level to reveal a photo of the next boss to be pursued. If the puzzle could be solved within the allotted period of time, the player would be awarded a bonus life. For every two pieces placed correctly, the player would be awarded with one extra hit point. If any of the missing pieces were missed or if the puzzle isn't solved in time, then the game will automatically piece the whole image together (without any bonuses, of course). Then, Tracy would interrogate the fallen boss for where to search next for clues leading to Big Boy and Tess.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRknxeYTP8M","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Realtime Associates","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"78170b27-c2f7-43da-96e3-9cb013bb3a1a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"69a06979-c506-45cb-8e18-b65671ca428e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"abd216ce-05f1-4325-896e-ba53c6e4f93c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"305aabae-a172-4b3d-93d6-685cb755528b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"bd1d2a35-0c8c-452b-a8c5-330b7ca33199.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"e0ae967a-ae6e-46a9-a179-183e79827025.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"90b0193f-acfe-4d8e-a52b-ebe23ccdf2ea.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"5bf7134a-3992-4043-b145-609761b42416.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"287207fa-de3c-4f92-aad0-c65c4e4d2bb6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"a6b06e1d-6808-4718-bca0-29cb0bd605ee.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"2336defd-cbf5-48bc-b252-191bbdaeee9e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"6ae7c210-674c-4566-8b6c-c5fd5eead144.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"b655c656-589d-41dc-a253-57aa6e497119.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18618,"FileName":"268077cb-6e66-4e3e-b8f1-e95e67183198.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Korea"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24092,"Name":"Die Maus","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"Die Maus is an action / puzzle game based on the German children's television show Die Sendung mit der Maus (The show with the mouse).\n\nYou control both main characters of the show, the mouse and the elephant, in a search for the duck who has disappeared.

Only after much traveling may you return to pay off your debts.\n\nFranky is back - with new levels and new challenges, but hurry . . . time is running out!!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyI46iuwMF8","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"MovieTime Ltd.","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"79c4eef4-33dc-4e31-a411-5d0f81eb6162.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"43eac5e2-6f97-4a79-b955-3b4863e9d775.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"b847b617-e816-4ae3-8d1c-92b2e7c2ed87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"65069c92-c2bf-4af8-bcd3-0703a085482d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"ae987e90-8f5b-4458-9d2a-c4fb4be479c0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"1bcfb46c-495a-482b-b9a6-8a78f38f162e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18621,"FileName":"de45d6ee-b37c-4890-98bf-f89c5caf6d57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3178,"Name":"Dr. Mario","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It's Dr. Mario for an intense new challenge!

The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and \"bump\" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.\n\n\n\nThe player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bCeBsdjEr0","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Epoch Co.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1990-08-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"99a6ae3f-8ef9-4b5c-be6a-efa434dc0fa7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"07213c59-5b7e-4bcd-a010-48ad9d155385.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"0990629a-0eb6-4004-bd24-5825b00c0a75.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"c19dc793-b15e-4ef4-8c14-26f6569b046d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"b24b278c-feae-478d-91f3-107a24e2c295.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"59eb5dce-9d6a-425c-b6d2-f5af11d24436.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":119041,"FileName":"d704fa7b-f84a-4f73-ab7a-dc8acfc52123.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200470,"Name":"Dragonborne","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Travel through the region of Argon as Kris, in search of your missing father Kurtis, the greatest dragon slayer the region has ever known.\n\nDragonborne is made with GB Studio and features a turn based battle system, various mini quests and puzzles that you must complete to progress through the game.\n\nFight your way to each of the dragon caves to face your fears and overcome the challenges that stand in your way.\n\nAre you tough enough to find your father and save the region before the dragon's awake from their slumber? \n\nAround 10 hours of gameplay, puzzles, dungeons, multiple enemies, various weapon and armour upgrades, character zapping system, ranking system dependent on how you finish the game, various collectibles, mini quests, multiple endings and much more!!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Spacebot Interactive","Publisher":"Spacebot Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":200470,"FileName":"23327f60-54e5-45b1-86c1-bfa0948300ae.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200470,"FileName":"44c634fd-5710-43b1-96d0-e1b7cd689f24.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200470,"FileName":"845db3cc-a3d8-490e-9e8a-0df91e44d0e3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21634,"Name":"DragonHeart: Fire & Steel","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Seven evil dragons rule the world of DRAGONHEART: FIRE & STEEL.

After Alfred Chicken was complete, Peter Tattersall did the graphics, David Bland did 90% of the level design, but all 3 of the team created levels for Eddie. Jason McGann did the programming.\n\nThe game was in development for around 4 months. The team had tried pitching it to publishers at the time, but it was seen as a “risk” and deemed too expensive to promote. The game ran on a 64k cartridge.\n\nEventually the team was asked by Sunsoft to make a version of Alfred Chicken in Japanese, so Eddie’s was put a side and forgot about.\n\nAfter the Alfred Japanese version, we started looking at Eddie again. We looked into randomly generating levels and ported it to PC. We iterated a few approaches and eventually Zoop, so Eddie’s is in fact a precursor to Zoop.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Hookstone","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176483,"FileName":"bec2f747-e749-4a92-9dfd-518bcbae0728.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176483,"FileName":"e6f1d01b-ceae-4c95-89d3-1b27149eead5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176483,"FileName":"6a48cea3-116b-4b0a-a149-27274b716dd7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156389,"Name":"Eijukugo Target 1000","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Eijukugo Target 1000 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by C-Lab and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1997.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"C-Lab","Publisher":"Imagineer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156389,"FileName":"cec7562b-0d0d-4704-8081-55adc8b369fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156389,"FileName":"f3aa4707-834c-46fe-ac00-0ebce9c09b02.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156389,"FileName":"a82327ac-b6ab-4c16-959f-90ce5713e97c.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156389,"AlternateName":"Goukaku Boy Series - Eijukugo Target 1000","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":164735,"Name":"Eiken 2: Kyuu Level no Kaiwa Hyuugen 333","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Eiken 2-Kyuu Level no Kaiwa Hyuugen 333 is an Edutainment game, published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1997.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":"C-Lab","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164735,"FileName":"15aaa4b3-13f4-42a1-92d9-f4d8fa1b5a3a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164735,"FileName":"254e57bf-60a1-473b-86b6-d68aaafa4b3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":164735,"FileName":"429d8420-ad49-4c80-bd63-eee6ab180349.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164735,"AlternateName":"Goukaku Boy Series: Eiken 2kyuu Level no Kaiwa Hyougen 333","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":153834,"Name":"Eitango Target 1900","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Eitango Target 1900 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by C-Lab and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1996.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"C-Lab","Publisher":"Imagineer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":153834,"FileName":"b6727f88-30e7-446a-9211-c7525f51180d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":153834,"FileName":"798596b0-bdd4-4b01-bce4-b2a0df072c40.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":153834,"AlternateName":"Goukaku Boy Series: Eitango Target 1900","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":18622,"Name":"Elevator Action","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Man: Super Agent #17 (code name \"Otto\")\n\nThe Mission: Retrieve disks containing valuable information from a criminal organization.\n\nThe Means: Infiltrate their top-security defense building.

The main difference is that the game features two playing modes with 80 levels each: one is puzzle oriented while the other features more enemies. The levels themselves are a mix between the levels featured in the PC-88 and NES versions.\n\nThe game itself is a puzzle game in which the player controls a mole who has to push a blue stone on an specially marked place. The stone can only be pushed, but not pulled. While Flappy does not care about gravity, the blue and red stones do: they fall down if pushed off an edge. This has to be used to clear a path for the blue stone and to crush enemies which try to hurt Flappy. Touching them or being crushed by a stone results in the loss of a life.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ratpjqTp_Sc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26078,"FileName":"1620ac37-f949-4c09-b38d-7814b1475eb5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26078,"FileName":"eb610f07-5116-4b2c-9dbc-72b167c78a6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26078,"FileName":"2ff4805a-acc3-4937-ac52-66fb1971bdc3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26078,"FileName":"8d95f10e-612f-4004-b456-d861ae3aa894.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26078,"FileName":"b99de710-5b42-4818-864b-5badf5e4f3b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26078,"FileName":"45dcb702-2f45-47b5-ac09-a1a50b21133e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126737,"Name":"Fleet Commander VS.","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Fleet Commander is a strategy game developed and published by ASCII Entertainment for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.\n\nThe game is similar to Midnight Commander, released for a number of popular Japanese home computer systems in 1983. Fleet Commander was followed up with a sequel, Fleet Commander 2, released exclusively for the MSX2 in 1990. In 1991, another version of the game was released for Game Boy titled Fleet Commander Vs..","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Ascii Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126737,"FileName":"8c73b818-5bf9-41c4-bece-8794c5786d53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21639,"Name":"Flipull","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Get into one of the gnarliest brain games around!

Go and have a read as if you already have the rom you might be interested in details.\n\n(...) \n\nOn March 6, 1998 (a week after the release of Nectaris GB), Hudson Soft of Japan released GB KISS LINK -- one of the most intriguing Gameboy peripherals ever released (yes, Gameboy Advance peripherals included).  So, you ask, what type of peripheral was GB KISS LINK ?  Well, GB KISS LINK was an infrared modem that allowed folks to connect their Gameboy (with a GB KISS cartridge installed) to a personal computer (running PC Windows 95).  This allowed gamers to transfer data (i.e. game save states, custom maps created with the map editor, exclusive content downloaded from Hud- son's website, etc.) between their PC and Gameboy cartridge.  Yes, you heard that right... the original 1989 Gameboy, which was considered ancient technology well before 1998, was still getting innovative (others might call it \"gimmicky\" ) software and hardware support whilst other, less fortunate handhelds (i.e. NEC's PC-Engine GT, Atari's Lynx, Sega's Game Gear, etc.) had long been abandoned in the graveyard of gaming devices. \n\nSpeaking of ancient technology, Gameboy Color was released in 1998, the same year as GB KISS LINK and Nectaris GB.  It was the first (and only) Gameboy design to feature an infrared (IR) communication port.  When I first heard about file sharing via GB KISS, I assumed it was designed with Gameboy Color's IR port in mind.  Then I realized that Nintendo did not release Gameboy Color until October 1998 (seven months after the release of Nectaris GB and the GB KISS LINK).  Then a friend told me that the Japanese version of Pocket Bomberman (which was released in December of 1997) featured GB KISS functionality as well.... Well, it was at this point that I knew that I was totally confused:  how exactly did GB KISS work, since the original Gameboy (and 1996's Gameboy Pocket update) did not have an infrared (IR) communication port?\n\n(....)\n\nAs I noted in the previous section, the GB KISS LINK modem was bundled with two 3.5\" floppy diskettes.  The second disk contained 29 mini-games for play on the Gameboy (I have yet to verify that the 29 games were all unique and not simply variations).  The mini-game disk is never pictured in the promotional photos, which is odd because companies usually want consumers to feel like they are getting their money's worth.  And \"getting your money's worth\" was the very reason Hudson included games in the GB KISS LINK bundle -- so gamers would actually be able to use their new modem immediately (assuming they had at least one GB KISS Gameboy cart, that is).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167347,"FileName":"3aaf1018-471f-4ed7-b807-b275d977fc8c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167347,"FileName":"30fedef4-1a2b-4706-a843-1ddb78afc75a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21641,"Name":"Gear Works","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Gear Works is the ultimate puzzle game that's easy-to learn but impossible to master.

In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.\n\nGhostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"019a3d2e-bb3e-420c-9bca-9118a3ba880f.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"bb952439-460a-47cb-8615-32368b93c594.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"5c9c2fde-f901-4507-b45c-d71a852c72a2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"9d84b4ef-ce1b-4ad8-ad57-c5ada7dd7efb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"653a1807-7a66-4cf9-b7ef-1c6aec0bbed3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"dab16607-e46f-4cb1-b09a-3212ec5cf568.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"44e6213a-4c6c-4bee-b3ef-20d48f331969.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"264dcbc8-5739-4da2-93e8-b5f1d383e548.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"d1cdb672-a71a-4c6e-a356-679ed747042e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"aad8ecec-4bab-4c16-9c86-c452cd49cd47.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"acc9583e-2041-4fa7-8d6c-e9166b631529.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"ef5babce-43c1-4296-b7f5-e0e92746b97e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"ef3b6c7d-4386-4487-a7e6-362bf9bb7526.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"3f503ba6-e4ca-45f2-8150-77eb1c111711.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"69d966b6-5c6a-40e2-8d62-6716441420b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10745,"FileName":"9c29c786-bb3b-4a29-a771-7f943f359edc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166947,"Name":"GI King!

The game was released by Konami in 1993, only in Japan. The game was re-released in 1998 through the Nintendo Power service, adding Super Game Boy support and featuring a bestiary for encountered monsters; this version was called God Medicine: Fukkokuban.\n\nA video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company mysteriously is destroyed. Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a shack with a great demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon exits through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom to save the game's world. However, they must also protect the real world from the demon.\n\nGod Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up through battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged during battle first. The charges last even if the battle is finished. The player can save anytime, except in battle.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJYG6knYwM","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"83ccadec-7e89-4dc6-9396-fc28da1514c0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"6225eb68-698d-4829-8030-48658f7a1ab3.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"d3c9ff78-f28e-465c-b535-7065d7d94e22.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"6f2b0622-1da0-4d57-a6dd-3c2212ebcba3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"4656176e-2ecc-4b69-b1a3-58e20e3ffc35.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"6efe984f-cfef-4df7-806c-4f397472504e.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"1a9783bd-d1f3-41a9-afce-cd8b6fa05e09.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"e6e95218-8f80-433b-bbaa-37bc2a3366b0.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"a91aee2f-b205-48ce-b220-0823a53d5508.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"e0a36e16-5166-4603-a0e5-390c17050064.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"462d2c96-55ee-43ac-a581-a88ae5a6d0e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"FileName":"f8c242d8-1a57-4c79-b873-17316e64ed33.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":19042,"AlternateName":"God Medicine: Hukkoku Han","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19042,"AlternateName":"God Medicine Hukkoku Ban","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19042,"AlternateName":"God Medicine: Fukkokuban","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":18684,"Name":"Godzilla","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"DESTROY ALL ROCKS AND ADVANCE TO THE NEXT SCENE!

And if you have ever played “Tetris”, you will almost certainly recognize some kind of resemblance when you first play “Into the Blue”. You will discover even more similarities if you compare it to “Tetris Attack”, a lesser known variant of the same principle. In both “Tetris Attack” and “Into the Blue”, you have a vertical playfield with panels raising from the bottom. The panels can be rearranged and will disappear if three (or more) matching panels are lined up in a horizontal or vertical row. The game is over if a panel touches the upper border of the playfield.\n\nBut while it is true that “Into the Blue” and “Tetris Attack” play very similarly, it is still not correct to call “Into the Blue” a “Tetris Attack” clone. Actually, “Into the Blue” is based on a game that is even a few years older than “Tetris Attack” and features slightly different game mechanics. That game, a Sega Genesis title by the name of “Megapanel”, is widely forgotten today – probably because it was never released on any other systems and never made its way out of Japan. Although there is no proof that “Megapanel” inspired the creators of “Tetris Attack”, it seems reasonable to assume that they were familiar with the game and tried to improve it.\n\nSo, what’s the point in porting an obscure old game from one obsolete game console to another? First of all, I wanted to create a game that in spite of being similar to many other Game Boy titles, adds something new to the Game Boy library. But just like in my earlier “Retroid” project, the main reason was to learn more about the Game Boy and its capabilities. The technical differences between “Into the Blue” and its predecessor “Retroid” may not be obvious for the average player, but under the hood, everything has changed. And while many of the technical changes do not directly affect the gameplay, there is at least one technical improvement everybody can see: “Into the Blue” offers a competitive two player mode that is accessible if two Game Boys are connected via the link cable.\n\nBut enough being said – why should you read about a game you can actually play? Please, scroll back to the top of this page, download your copy and check it out now!\n\n“Into the Blue” features:\n\n9 Speed levels\n3 Difficulty levels\n3 In-game songs (plus 1 title song)\n1 Competitive mode for 2 players","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVF41Xo4rgU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Jonas Fischbach","Publisher":"Celestial Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166662,"FileName":"16a11278-9541-41c4-80bb-08069b3b6da0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166662,"FileName":"be2edb11-a5a4-486e-be20-8af7c7563075.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150431,"Name":"Ippatsu Gyakuten: DX Bakenou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bet on virtual horse races in this Japanese only Game Boy game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Graphic Research","Publisher":"Asmik Ace Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1991-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":150431,"FileName":"38a5a05a-1572-48cc-b5fa-b554c4c46932.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21657,"Name":"Iron Man / X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Metal titans, Iron Man and X-O Manowar, come together for the first time ever to tackle one heavy-duty cosmic crisis!

It was released exclusively in Japan. The game is notable for featuring nearly every monster in the Godzilla franchise up until the time of its release. \n\nWhile the game does not feature a distinguishable story, the basic premise is that hundreds of monsters have arisen all over Japan and Godzilla is the only one who can defeat all of them. Human armies will attempt to slow down Godzilla and the other monsters' rampage. The game ends with a final battle between Godzilla and Super MechaGodzilla, with Godzilla emerging as the victor and retaining his title as the King of the Monsters. \n\nThe game is a 2D side-scroller, with Godzilla being the only playable character. Godzilla can use a wide variety of attacks, including a punch, a kick, and a tail whip. He can also use his signature atomic breath, which can be fired up, down, or straight. Using the aforementioned attack drains him of his health. If Godzilla stops moving, his health gradually gets restored. Buildings on the background can sometimes be interacted with, and if destroyed, will sometimes refill Godzilla's health quickly.\n\nThe game does not feature a save system, and it only allows the player to continue for three times if they are killed. There are five levels, with each level containing a final boss monster that Godzilla needs to defeat before he is able to progress further into the game.\n\nAside from monsters, various human vehicles such as warships, gunships, fighter jets, and tanks also serve as enemies in the game. However, they do not deal significant damage to Godzilla and can be destroyed easily.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"f07e642d-6eeb-49d5-8b5a-fdf336a9ae27.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"1a6a5c9b-be38-4556-8c54-41a540226f14.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"784ef26a-3c15-41ce-b599-0383c7eddd2e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"92181534-34ab-4679-ab6a-6f2d2c0a81da.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"8dbf86b2-1aa8-4838-bf5d-3f9420285e04.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"a6c943fb-53bc-4d8b-8c06-c1c03acef7bf.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"d98bddf0-78ca-41c6-9966-c71d19a13023.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"FileName":"0662ad4e-e34f-4e2b-b41e-2467ff19a9ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":167216,"AlternateName":"Kaijuu Ou Gojira","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167216,"AlternateName":"King of the Monsters, Godzilla","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167216,"AlternateName":"Kaiju-o Godzilla","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":127702,"Name":"Kamen Rider SD Hashire!

Words are randomly selected from the Bible and hidden in pairs on the screen. Move the flashing box to a hidden word and press A. The word will be revealed. Now move to another hidden word and press A. If the two words match, you gain ten points and the words will disappear from the screen. If they do not match, you lose five points and the words will be covered again. After three correct matches in a row, a cherry will appear. Capture it to get a thirty point bonus. After five correct matches in a row, a Boom will appear. Capture it to reveal all words briefly.\n\nThe other word game is Bible Shepherd, a Bible-themed version of Hangman. You have three sheep in a pen, the alphabet to select from and a word who's letters are hidden, showing only blank spaces. Move your cursor to a letter and press A. If the letter is not in the word, the sheep will stop moving. Select an incorrect letter again and one of the sheep will jump out of the pen. If you select a correct letter, its location(s) will be revealed in the word and, if you have sheep outside the pen, one will jump back in. You get one hundred points for each correct guessed word plus ten points for any sheep in the pen when the word is guessed correctly. If all three sheep jump from the pen before you can reveal the word, you lose.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/WczuJDRqAIs","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Wisdom Tree, Inc","Publisher":"Wisdom Tree, Inc","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"395a3416-ae0d-481b-8507-f6f608e43451.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"ed35955a-dc6a-42c2-8b43-e223c61ef90f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"cc6d16e3-4e62-42ae-9b4e-43144752cc9c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"58431877-6e97-4dc8-aee9-75bfe419227e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"ff28db08-9c9d-4ef2-a3d2-64a8346f3dd7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"51701f0e-08d8-4ebd-aa96-b225ee437da5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":112577,"FileName":"6e6196bb-679c-4ccd-a091-54c18851ddc9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24085,"Name":"Kingdom Crusade","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This video game takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army.

Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjcHAU5jb8","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1992-04-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"5211e854-7fcf-4c5b-9286-8a7c8d84db0b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"c17b60f6-aeee-4051-a829-0c94d10868c6.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"53fc15f3-e852-47a4-9d34-98ddab985496.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"f8b9c901-5d90-4bb0-bcdb-9617a3392030.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"cd9dd94e-881a-4497-9d22-445ba460aab3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"c97c7b74-3c30-4316-8441-070e5e82db9b.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"3d0c9bc4-fdae-4361-b5e0-425e22c89dac.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"9c16bc72-a642-4d43-b442-db2f4632d97e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"82158e81-f5fa-403d-859b-06f6c65740e7.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"3b8dd34f-b388-4dd2-b7a0-ed8fda811334.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"76aa6fe9-f65e-435f-8d6b-a472777c6526.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"b440e2d5-bcf8-4fc9-9033-16e033f2ede9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"1cce0940-afb3-4d75-97c2-c047c0629879.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"6c528313-ec97-4460-a75f-21aa0d65e108.JPG","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"d0440157-776f-4ade-aa14-64b1f6cb2d82.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"7d16343d-8871-48d1-be83-32d629e2c869.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"bf245679-0e11-436c-bce7-1de4b0c88e1e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"c10d0f5a-ad73-4626-a87a-5b415f63f308.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"2f362451-2a59-4cbf-82c3-958955cb08d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"3ce26efb-3cbb-4ac4-a4ec-181e59c4ce77.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"346b535f-b1f1-4066-a406-ebdb78f82e53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"f31f21a6-2f41-4666-87b8-01c425d70ce9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8706,"FileName":"f4ddd22d-512a-4465-a95d-4638b7e92a68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8706,"AlternateName":"Hoshi no Kirby","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":3190,"Name":"Kirby's Dream Land 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Rainbow Bridges have disappeared!

In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.\n\nThe races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.\n\nWhen police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.\n\nEach race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower.

In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.\n\nPlayers guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items. You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions. Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.\n\nLocations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.\n\nSome levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform; Racing","Developer":"Bit Managers","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24088,"FileName":"18bfdcdd-2578-45e9-bf0a-0b1d5f6f7f95.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24088,"FileName":"ceba38bb-e4c5-4146-a88e-001729225cb4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24088,"FileName":"a5c38f97-35a0-4768-978c-29d2b0a7f71c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24088,"FileName":"76a18778-3f24-46b2-a2d3-ea124c57662f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24088,"FileName":"1e4732da-2483-4bad-aaec-b54216f9e479.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":24088,"FileName":"a99ac1f5-4591-44c5-93e4-af9b014e6028.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24089,"Name":"Lucle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"L.U.C.L.E is an intergalactic space shuttle in search of alien life form.\nIt's latest task is to explore the newly discovered planet \"Hexlexon\" 4.3 billion miles from the sun.\nOn entering its atmosphere LUCLE is drained of most of its vital power.\nWith time running out fast, LUCLE must travel over hazardous mountain ranges across deep caverns and icy lakes dotted with bombs, pit holes and take blocks to reach this vital energy source-Hexlexon centre of power \"The Solar Energising Zones\".\nThe Race is On ...... challenge the clock through a labyrinth of 30 Action Packed Brain Teasing Levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Vic Tokai","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"b838984e-4d6a-4804-9da3-fb556e363eb4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"3aa75d8e-9a14-4caa-9697-dbe6a9659551.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"16d7defa-ca1f-41d0-9a6e-f34822a35a08.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"b5d100e2-d907-42c3-912e-cb725a0202ce.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"2a6351a2-8e8a-4c5c-b8e5-cb5011079d00.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"836bd069-e31a-41ca-b939-0b115472a8b5.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"3e95f1db-4f56-42bb-bd87-85a789b6bc43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":24089,"FileName":"e355b9f6-fc5c-4e98-a841-763a651d22f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167250,"Name":"Lunar Lander","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lunar Lander is a space exploration game based around three separate stages:\n\nLift-off: Fly your space shuttle into outer space by following the guidance arrows displayed on the screen. If you don't centre the shuttle according to the signs, your progress is slowed down and you will run out of fuel before leaving Earth's gravitation. You must also keep an eye on your compressor, since it must be constantly at a high level for the rockets to boost sufficiently. Feeding the compressor too much will deplete your fuel, though, so everything must be balanced for the lift-off to be successful.\n\nLanding: This stage is very similar to the old Lunar Lander type of game that was popular in the early eighties. From a map of the moon, you select one of eight landing sites. On the landing screen, you must carefully guide your lander through the cave-like craters to the landing pads. Different landing pads are worth different amounts of points, according to level of difficulty. Preserving your lander's fuel will also give bonus points. Unlike most typical Lander games, your craft has no rockets for going left or right – instead you must rotate your lander and ignite the single landing rocket in order to adjust your angle. There are also meteorites to watch out for.\n\nExploration: Once you have landed, an astronaut steps out on the surface, armed with a metal detector. Your task here is to find five different kinds of metal ore and bring them to the lander before you run out of air or time. The metal detector beeps with different frequencies according to your vicinity to a piece of metal. If there is a constant beep, you drill for the metal. If you drill elsewhere, you may find flowers that replenish your air supply. To complicate things, the moon surface is filled with robots that try to hunt you down. Contact with a robot wears down your air supply. \n\nAfter you have landed and explored all eight areas, your mission is completed and you proceed to the next one, which is more of the same.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A1LNmknEJU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"f3cf48d3-c679-4cc8-ab71-f0c4d2f38c8e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"cb2419e5-2b4f-44d6-b9ff-62cf77ba9e72.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"39421565-b8c8-4121-b6cd-c3d89f52cffb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"51320628-4955-432c-aecc-b8979a4b3afd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"f20e01e0-a97a-4cdb-928b-d455d467bf89.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"17b57841-7ed4-438e-a004-85d9e9ffa45c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"bd90af4c-13fb-4a82-9c8b-3717180b5562.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167250,"FileName":"17b5d0b2-7593-4045-af45-33a15cea1565.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167251,"Name":"Mach Go Go Go","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Mach Go Go Go is a Racing game, developed by TOSE and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1997.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167251,"FileName":"ebfdae62-c383-4faf-9f69-55ddd6781caf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167251,"FileName":"d68f13ba-f1d3-4e19-b2a6-361df9aeaa19.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20478,"Name":"Madden 95","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Madden Football series makes its debut on the Game Boy with Madden 95.

Special modes include Championship playoffs - featuring 38 legendary champion teams, including Green Bay '66, San Francisco '89 and Pittsburgh '78 - and Franchise playoffs - featuring 12 'all-time' teams. Exhibition mode allows players to select from all regular, champion and franchise teams plus a regular Madden and an all-time Madden team. Game length can be set between 20, 40 and 60 minutes.\n\nThe game features a playbook of more than 80 offensive plays (including fake punts and field goals) and more than 60 defensive plays, all of which can be flipped. The game also features freely definable audibles, substitutions (quarterback and halfback only), timeouts, and game stats.\n\nGameplay during a game is seen from the top, with the field scrolling vertically. Players are moved via the D-pad and the Game Boy's two buttons are used for throwing the ball left or right during passing play, spinning or diving during rushing play, selecting the defender closest to the ball or tackling during defensive play, and so on.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8zEjrMO8w0","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Halestorm","Publisher":"Malibu Interactive/EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"b0f8e351-625f-44d2-8f7d-e4b0dde1ea91.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"47c51a8e-9cd7-46a6-8f98-90db21c06134.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"e5c3767c-4675-471f-b617-20037415e3aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"f6802826-b978-48a4-809e-7fb4a21b55a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"2e6f1926-19d8-4a1d-8094-9c474d564281.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"516cd5d0-a367-4df8-895f-65dd59db5345.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"f21787c1-16a0-4865-9d3f-57c340d4b8e1.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20478,"FileName":"1759e237-6822-45be-8e35-c8c38eff0eba.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20479,"Name":"Madden 96","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"All 30 NFL teams, including Jacksonville and Carolina.

As a licensed product for the McDonald's fast food franchise, the game occasionally features the various logos and characters from McDonald's restaurant signage and television advertisements, for the purposes of plot advancement and power-ups. It stars two children who venture into the fantasy world of McDonaldland in order to return Ronald McDonald's magical bag, which has been stolen by the Hamburglar.\n\nM.C. Kids was also released for the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS, though all of these home computer versions were only sold in Europe.[1] Additionally, a different version of the game was released for the Game Boy, as McDonaldland. This version was released outside of Europe as Spot: The Cool Adventure, themed upon the Cool Spot franchise. Virgin Interactive would release another game based on the McDonald's franchise for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis called Global Gladiators that is more of a traditional side-scrolling action-adventure game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Virgin Games","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"5fc9debb-788f-4533-bdf6-ff0a0811beca.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"56e9da2f-69ab-41f4-8d5b-af1eeff9d70d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"f1fcdb95-4a8a-48f7-9ee4-ae38a3b4c77e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"63cfe349-314d-4244-9152-459e91c2e172.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"3b7654ee-e4c9-4038-b304-5104db7617bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"13a2cafe-b1dc-432c-b798-993b4b0cdc93.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27881,"FileName":"cc7fb390-3f80-4a86-9a35-31e302452025.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165583,"Name":"Medarot Parts Collection","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This companion game lets players harvest Medaparts to use in the main Medarot game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Natsume","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165583,"FileName":"fce5c76a-a200-451a-8ba3-f974b6595d6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165584,"Name":"Medarot Parts Collection 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A second companion game that lets players harvest Medaparts to use in the main Medarot game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Natsume","Publisher":"Imagineer","ReleaseDate":"1998-05-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165584,"FileName":"3c08c993-9e7c-4bb7-9244-a0b00f1f3cce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165578,"Name":"Medarot: Kabuto Version","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The first game in the Medarot/Medabots series.

The developers Kemco also published the first-person RPG games Shadowgate (NES) and Drakkhen (SNES) as well as a million Bugs Bunny and Top Gear games and more recently many iOS/Android JRPG’s including a colour remake of this very game (which again sadly was never localised).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://youtu.be/acKY4t9422U","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":166995,"FileName":"968d4dfe-4419-4c77-88d7-655bee514570.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18365,"Name":"Nemesis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.\n\nThe cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Ultra Games","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"f52d6be2-7f93-4b2d-a265-fc6b33fadd5b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"a4c7be6f-372d-4218-9251-c93f852021e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"5adbaf2e-287d-4a09-9ac8-1f3b928c4974.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"db091e67-54b1-4ec9-93c2-662faa17e42c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"71d6b2c3-8852-430f-ba62-9be2e641288d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"2a940962-711d-437f-a23d-57a966d113e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"562b9071-a87f-41c1-b2fa-76ac016ac551.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"3facba5e-62a5-41c9-afb0-ec5f68ebd2ea.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"cc8f0de1-640b-4c1f-b9ad-7d3c3f680a50.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"188e3183-adc0-4732-b8e3-3ef106ef2b69.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"26c555ca-3aa7-4b71-99d2-2d116e33c642.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"b19db6c0-1245-4455-9262-7d8f587742fc.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"8d23fa2a-618b-47e4-b4aa-e43a366200b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"6573d043-2ec8-44db-82c9-806131a8e33a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18365,"FileName":"34a723ab-2049-41a1-877d-d7d40a907f5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31734,"Name":"Nettou Garou Densetsu 2: Aratanaru Tatakai","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The three lone wolves return to clash with new opponents in the \"Sultan of Slugs\" Battle Royale.

There’s also the usual bonus blocks that remove entire rows, as is common in this genre. A two-player mode is also featured, even though unlike what usually happens in two-player gameplay of puzzle games, the actions of one player will not affect the other directly (like having more blocks falling on your opponent’s screen after you scored pretty high).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Game Freak","Publisher":"Victor Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"682c7723-0177-4fc2-a5fa-a1db22d15d4a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"d71b3b68-f586-4036-a125-2b8733832ec9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"4fbe59ac-9e17-4f97-9157-407355ed871e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"561afb65-ecbe-45da-bb1d-3e836931833b.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"ff5cb102-489b-4198-bd30-e84fee30ad60.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"a142aef4-a335-4258-a309-cf1afba4f3f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167287,"FileName":"8093fa42-9c2d-42d7-834d-aa03293b76e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":167287,"AlternateName":"Nontan to Issho: KuruKuru Puzzle","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":22569,"Name":"Noobow","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Help Noobow get to the end of each level in this candy-filled puzzler from Irem!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Irem","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"60941ec0-7d40-4121-8d70-f7c005573713.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"a72ae61d-3fa6-4bdd-88f3-aea96ad419f2.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"565e9f58-3683-4d44-aa88-591facf5e4b6.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"f77731a6-d267-4453-8d0d-e211aa5342c8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"685ef03a-d04a-4e3f-8814-21f3f5436207.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"2e161b5e-ae3b-4cf0-8d37-ad0285edbc74.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"a3bc3d58-21cd-4d05-9eb9-77c988568045.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22569,"FileName":"a4250f07-9be2-4c93-9869-100f6f951236.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21511,"Name":"Oddworld Adventures","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You're Abe, the chanting Mudokon - the skinny guy in the loincloth with no weapons.

But he hasn't come alone. Viper's transported a battalion of battletron tanks, stealth subs, laser cannons, and annihilating androids.

The pachinko balls are not only the active object but also the bet and the prize. The player loads one or more balls into the machine, then presses and releases a spring-loaded handle, which is attached to a padded hammer inside the machine, thus launching the ball into a metal track. The track guides the ball around the edge of the playing field, then when the ball loses momentum, it falls into the playing field from near the top. Some pachinko machines have a bumper to bounce the ball as it reaches the top, while other machines allow the ball to travel all the way around the field, to fall on the second time that it reaches the top. In either case, the ball enters the playing field, which is populated by a large number of brass pins, several small cups into which the player hopes the ball will fall (each catcher is barely the width of the ball), and a hole at the bottom into which the ball will fall if it doesn't enter a catcher. The ball bounces from pin to pin, both slowing the fall and making it travel laterally across the field. A ball that enters a catcher will trigger a payout, in which a number of balls are dropped into a tray at the front of the machine.The object of the game is to capture as many balls as possible. Pachinko Kaguya Hime is based around this game and offers many fun variants and machine types to play. If you want to control what machines you play, then during gameplay, on reaching a pachinko machine, press Start twice and enter one of the below button sequences.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Marionette","Publisher":"Coconuts Japan","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167080,"FileName":"dd5b9516-03f5-4b25-8218-6e52948a8b6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167080,"FileName":"c4dbba94-a64a-444c-adf5-913ef9c4f1c3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167080,"FileName":"5c3ac98c-490d-4b30-9593-ae27b7f02599.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167080,"FileName":"16b4ef7a-b629-42e1-b025-d295ff7f9883.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167080,"FileName":"e55c9fae-a49b-4674-b43d-d36955d3a9ab.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167077,"Name":"Pachinko Monogatari Gaiden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A story based game centering around Pachinko game machine play, which if you are somehow unaware is a cross between a western pinball game and a slot machine.

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the \"skill\" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.\n\nPlay perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.\n\nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout \"First Down!\" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"918e5a20-388a-4d4c-9791-c6e6acfbac01.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"8a7c7f81-3d93-47c9-af40-baaec6012354.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"a61af547-bc10-40a8-a229-07f87b29fa11.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"b39b7f10-14d7-4465-8738-aae7a4b84547.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"04ba5289-cb8d-487b-ad00-da29399239c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"1e8f3007-5d44-4fae-b78b-b394a92d8f94.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22483,"FileName":"b7c2441a-e42c-43b6-87b4-b1c3f1eaf0ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21698,"Name":"Pocahontas","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Find the Path to Peace\n\nAs Pocahontas, you must use courage and quick thinking to conquer obstacles and help your animal friends.

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.\n\nThere are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-31T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140130,"FileName":"d1345b20-4d2f-42b1-aae8-08a3d61bcca1.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140130,"FileName":"c42d13bf-594e-4370-977f-5c85cc2e4867.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140130,"FileName":"432c8244-a0db-497b-98d5-9e35ed2f8929.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140130,"FileName":"10a836e7-3414-4e1f-9527-2ee64f717fba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140130,"FileName":"6b9dfad0-704d-4009-aff4-110b20d6279a.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21705,"Name":"Pyramids of Ra","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this game you control an adventuring archaeologist who you navigate through a maze of tombs.

To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.\n\nLater stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional – or even four-dimensional – thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.\n\nA second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"SETA Corporation","Publisher":"SETA Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"29f719df-631c-477e-b3e9-377438b3632c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"b7f56a38-467f-46da-89da-a4e5d782565c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"683cf07a-c2d1-4de9-9541-b17765111506.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"09a62a6d-de7e-4896-81ea-ac06f2c4e4ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"5506b003-f067-4318-8778-2d313ed952f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"3d55f446-6105-4e74-aefd-e7ccaf2616fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"61d0caac-2af4-4534-91d2-1d3fdde5d4ed.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"8313783c-0e5d-4f2a-972e-02c9c5a317ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21706,"FileName":"ec476b5c-fc89-4a09-a1de-4882b29ba374.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23339,"Name":"Q*bert for Game Boy","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hop Q*bert up and down the steps of a \"three-dimensional\" pyramid, changing each step's color as he lands.

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.\n\nBy winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.\n\nLike the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTNSllbFBU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"The Code Monkeys","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"677c5229-19af-4e5d-bb6c-ce9e6f7817e6.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"0dc8392c-27e6-47d4-88b1-f0f061ef2bcf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"294bc3b8-8034-46b1-a970-fef3ec5eaf97.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"2b67765f-7539-4b54-b7eb-e3293c4050f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"52bed7a0-6a75-45eb-823a-23b860d86fef.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"88b5dcd9-17c6-4ea3-ab7d-1df29a37b6bf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"2204b4c6-ad0c-41fb-9b0a-dd8d71a73c94.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"75af07de-6139-4404-a585-8ca2657c5d91.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"4e5dbacc-2fad-43a8-a800-cd9504aefb9c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"2cc62097-8b11-4702-90f6-cb1e990c4844.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23340,"FileName":"6869d4e3-1f8d-4600-9656-25542e993ec7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167308,"Name":"Roadster","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Roadster lets the player race a sports car over tracks on various terrain.

The main mode available is the race mode. In this mode players select the amount of races they want to compete in (5, 10, 15, or 20).

While in the race, players can make pit stops to repair any tire wear or body damage they sustained while out on the track. Points are earned depending on where the player finished the race. More points are awarded for the better finish. The ultimate champion is the driver who totals the most points after a series of races.\n\nThere is occasionally a power-up that can be picked up during a race.

Following the concept of Taito's Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn't kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.\n\nEach level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.\n\nThe fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil force that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father \"guides\" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the evil in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father's death.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Eurocom Developments Ltd","Publisher":"Jaleco","ReleaseDate":"1993-05-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"a11b1f23-11c6-4230-9c46-643444ad1705.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"636aef2a-a1d1-4c11-8f73-e6bf7e2a66ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"840c0f57-b29a-4d3e-b092-2f3efaf7407e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"f555870d-9203-4962-b707-e50f616412c7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"78ed77f2-4821-4f87-931b-5490e153d9d6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"d95dc24d-84b8-4be5-91b9-ea64ab3b26fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"f65ef917-da9c-436c-aebb-d58cd59c4897.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"6232d182-920f-46ad-a182-7d123c4b92ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"42c4e48d-a5db-4e51-8e10-f881f6a37d0d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"c898c28b-5858-4b1b-8bb7-4e4d657694b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24117,"FileName":"46462f95-cb3d-4873-ab44-c72e1ca59038.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":24117,"AlternateName":"Yousei Monogatari: Rod Land","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":21593,"Name":"Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It took LJN and Roger \"The Rocket\" Clemens, the best pitcher in baseball, to bring home the greatest baseball game ever!\n\nThe view is as good as it gets with true over-the-shoulder in-the-field perspective, amazing close-ups of the close plays, TV style picture-in-picture stats and post-game coverage, and when the going gets rough, check out the pitching and strategy tips from the Rocket himself.\n\nYou choose your team and manage them through a simulated season, climaxing with a best of 7 championship series, or create your own dream match-ups in exhibition games.\n\nIt's 1 or 2-player baseball action at its best!

Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the TurboGrafx-16 with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.\n\nThe player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.\n\nThough the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Bits Studios","Publisher":"Irem","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"23e1b4fe-ce78-41f8-95e3-ea1ad489f562.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"6c48e0ad-15fe-4920-8bf0-9144547e2f18.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"9582fa41-664b-4127-b9ba-b98f84b0467f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"aa26b594-69dd-4dfa-8353-5e954f681d34.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"5a93f21b-3856-407b-a535-11b4bf7a20a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"62a10e6f-04b4-4af4-842c-a15428930977.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"b18e2bfb-ffc1-4a9e-bb65-a9c153f86a25.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"b14710c1-1e5a-4a99-babf-2baea0c9cf66.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"303eeb8f-cb2a-4920-a24f-d31c4fbc189f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"c24e66f7-9cf0-434e-afdb-578bdde0f09a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"f440147c-ab22-46eb-9fed-214f14163e04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18675,"FileName":"555467bc-03a4-402d-80f4-4ef736315673.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179863,"Name":"Sachen 4 in 1 Vol. 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle; Board Game","Developer":"Sachen","Publisher":"Sachen","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179863,"FileName":"53d6f943-6498-45fa-9ea9-6e417f312645.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179863,"FileName":"01d4dfb6-1e87-4fff-958f-e33ad61333b1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179863,"FileName":"c44131c5-667b-4c8a-a340-27cb7bd1587c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32150,"Name":"Sagaia","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long time ago, the planet of Darius went into ruin but Proco and Tiat of Darius gave birth to a new planet and named it Orga.

The game — along with ten other prototype ROMs — was sent to an anonymous researcher by a private collector. Looking to understand what they were sent, the researcher donated the files to Gaming Alexandria for inspection.\n\nSarakon started life as a simple variant of Activision’s Shanghai published by Virgin Games in 1991 for the Commodore 64 and Amiga. The game was developed by Starbyte Software, a small German company started in 1988 by Klaus-Jürgen Kraft that worked with many members of the early German demoscene. Starbyte originally focused solely on home computer development, but as Nintendo’s consoles became more popular in Europe, the company dabbled in porting their games to console systems — Sarakon being one of them.\n\nThe team tasked with porting Sarakon to the Game Boy was a small one, with Peter Sabath on programming , “R. Goede” on music, and Ingo Mesche on graphics. When asked about his work on the project, Ingo Mesche confirmed that the game was finished, but was unsure as to why it wasn’t released. He theorizes that it was due to Starbyte never getting a developer’s license from Nintendo. This would have been the responsibility of a publisher so it’s likely that Virgin Games or other publishers rejected the game for release.\n\nShortly after Sarakon‘s completion, Starbyte became insolvent was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1992. They were soon bought out by another company  — coincidently also called Starbyte — which let them, in the words of former developer Roman Werner, “take over the rights on published games without the need to pay their debts.”\n\nSarakon for the Game Boy would make its first public appearance in an issue of the German magazine Video Games. It would also be its last.  Since this preview in June 1992, two prototypes of the final game have surfaced: one in the hands of managing director Markus Scheer, and other being presented to you today by Gaming Alexandria.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Starbyte","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":200704,"FileName":"fbd8eef3-6068-4286-9229-2853bad33ab1.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":200704,"FileName":"9fbe0780-d887-42ce-9ac8-2f8c23b06da1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200704,"FileName":"7def3a7a-a566-41c5-8d8f-f501d1f68609.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167381,"Name":"Satoru Nakajima F-1 Hero GB World Championship '91","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1991 Japan-exclusive Game Boy Formula One video game published by Varie, endorsed by Satoru Nakajima, who was the first full-time Japanese racer in the history of Formula One.

The action is shown from a top-down perspective which only shows a part of the playfield. The controls only use one button to initiate a shot: how long the button is pressed determines the strength and the direction pad controls the direction. However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).\n\nIn contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from. General options are the game length (between three and seven minutes) as well as switching weather on or off.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle; Sports","Developer":"Sensible Software","Publisher":"Sony Imagesoft","ReleaseDate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"080db94a-3a98-43d0-9170-181b4c9e6d3d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"bb8d58ec-e157-4ad8-8341-67989cff2f48.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"f04ca1a0-3227-4bbf-8aeb-4a4b5afcc76b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"ecd033a0-667f-492a-901d-81c8ecb1f69b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"af5fbec4-5453-4999-9eb6-929db08c5d38.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"158855b6-4270-4ed9-a86f-42e6cca8cbd1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"5dbe47d8-896c-4a0b-a88e-536e974c0445.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24119,"FileName":"272a19a3-876c-4e65-a934-3dd14def4e60.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21721,"Name":"Serpent","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Welcome to the land of the Serpent competitions!

It's a game everyone can play and enjoy.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"HAL","Publisher":"HAL","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"a8cc4e90-f0f1-4a61-954e-8005b86d3864.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"68c5ecf8-6f73-42d2-92e0-0bcaf2160c64.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"4ea9aac8-de09-4ba5-8ba3-44f148f105e7.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"4f5ac453-0a69-4532-9700-ee2068732b5c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"5f98a452-7d15-4a8e-b461-5a33a38502c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"0d3184d8-43f1-4c46-afbe-5b8ff05cd74b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"bf1a1772-bf05-4b55-b9b2-0ce8f4b1ab50.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"dff12f69-f571-4c46-ae8e-df603489d21d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"2dc0ba99-f061-4b84-aaff-aa5c41d6ded3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"afcffbdb-517c-4570-8768-6a827055758c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21722,"FileName":"909702ab-5450-47db-afb0-da752ac9074a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167113,"Name":"Shanghai Pocket","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"Shanghai Pocket is a Puzzle game, developed and published by SunSoft, which was released in Japan in 1998.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"ad9aaa60-d86e-4fad-a0f3-353f0a844b07.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"dc589646-3d84-47c6-94fa-903c75cd7cfa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"690a5a4b-dd9d-4620-8406-c816648a7aaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"b98bcd7c-a5f6-4c94-a4db-3cbd3f405832.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"58dd03d4-bcd6-4fd3-baaa-e5099d4c9b76.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"55d94ef7-c4c4-4990-b561-09dbaac4a599.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"5800961f-5857-4d2c-a133-3b216732884a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167113,"FileName":"5846330d-e613-41c7-b730-8f9e959f0130.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21723,"Name":"Shaq Fu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shaq brings his awesome skill and size to a multiworld fighting game!

Japanese pastimes like shogi, however, stood as the exception. Like Yakuman and Pachinko Time before it, Pony Canyon’s Shogi featured a tabletop game that’s never found its way beyond Asia… though in this case, it’s not because shogi is particularly unique to Japan but rather because the West already has its own variant: Chess. The two classic games are essentially the same thing, minus some differences in rules and aesthetics. But the two are sufficiently redundant that Americans have no need for shogi… yet sufficiently different that publishers can’t just reskin a shogi game and pass it off as chess, either. Another similarity between Shogi, Yakuman, and Pachinko Time: This Game Boy release was a part of something akin to a tradition for its publisher, Pony Canyon. Just as Nintendo had released a few mahjong games before Yakuman and Coconuts Japan was all about dressing up virtual pachinko with the trappings of an adventure game, Pony Canyon specialized in shogi titles.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fKIQ8oQJ7Q","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167356,"FileName":"acb70fa4-9a0a-4338-998a-d32253525cf2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167357,"Name":"Shougi Saikyou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shogi Saikyou is a Miscellaneous game, published by Magical Company (Mahou), which was released in Japan in 1994.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNnUdLcmUNs","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Magical Company","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167357,"FileName":"4eb1ce4b-f503-468e-8f8e-1ca82904da2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167358,"Name":"Shounen Ashibe: Yuuenchi Panic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shounen Ashibe is a Role-Playing game, published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkJ0J2LHIXg","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Takara","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167358,"FileName":"8feca28e-22b9-4bc7-9628-703b9b253daa.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167358,"FileName":"a2e02c22-feb4-49d9-a497-096b40a30adb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167358,"FileName":"a2e667c6-dc64-4bf4-8468-8399875de7dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167359,"Name":"Shuyaku Sentai Irem Fighter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shuyaku Sentai Irem Fighter is a Strategy game, published by Irem, which was released in Japan in 1993.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Irem","Publisher":"Irem","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167359,"FileName":"eaa7cfa1-e208-4691-b272-118814001f83.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167359,"FileName":"6bf34294-2b04-40e8-b74d-3d3bd1ada5ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167359,"FileName":"2021ecaa-25c5-4249-94fb-2bc38e2ff08c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21724,"Name":"Side Pocket","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Chalk up your cue stick and rack up those balls.

If one of the two sides is reached, stunts can be performed by pressing buttons. Which ones are performed depends on the speed and how long the buttons are pressed - the more dangerous, the more points they award. The goal is to gather as many points as possible in a limited amount of time.\n\nThe second mode is called \"Stale Fish Tour\" which takes the player through championships all over the world. Here the skater is shown from behind and races inside a sustained half-pipe. The player can accelerate, brake, move left and right, jump and duck. The goal is to reach the end of the course within three minutes. There are various obstacles which need to be dodged, e.g. concrete walls - bumping into them (or skating over the borders of the half-pipe) means the loss of valuable time. Sometimes there is an AI skater to deal with.

As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.\n\nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.\n\nThe sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.\n\nYou get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.\n\nA variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Spidersoft","Publisher":"Mindscape","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"3bea4417-4d13-4772-afbe-35bebcf19828.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"17111bb4-28d7-495b-b112-c1cb78a9674f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"0255b88f-ad50-4150-b251-6ccb7f13e974.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"8b09d335-9060-48c1-b152-c4e8f3927d28.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"af4c1e4e-d755-4d9e-a44f-3dbce33b5dbc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"b9f90f08-1dbe-4932-96e8-865ac92de262.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21736,"FileName":"0c52819c-9960-4d52-88cd-38fc60760b02.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21737,"Name":"Speedy Gonzales","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"\"Arriba, Arriba, Andale, Andale!\" The world's fastest mouse must rescue his friends, all mouse-napped by evil King Rat!

A password feature is also present and two-player capabilities utilizing the Game Boy Link cable.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLyDBdPLlz8","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Sports; Strategy","Developer":"Unexpected Development","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"da075121-8712-46e9-9abd-2c48c0bfd08a.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"5bde699d-413b-401e-8eea-2e225a161d1a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"a0544393-3cac-4d38-bade-dd050f330960.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"569606a6-7b19-45ae-8d62-6b8056ec4493.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"031bf4ff-6535-43aa-be13-df5e538d7deb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"3df2c9ee-e3d7-4c81-ab56-55f15ccef5de.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24124,"FileName":"5c1e4e45-0309-448c-9a2a-3c919488ac25.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":24124,"AlternateName":"Golf Classic","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":18589,"Name":"Spot: The Cool Adventure","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Spot: The Cool Adventure the player takes on the role of Spot, the 7UP mascot.

The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.\n\nOn away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.\n\nFinally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.\n\nThe second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Imagineering Inc","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"21a6e67e-4aba-4c7b-a2d5-e45d29a75412.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"94aa7e47-f0c8-4cbc-81ce-791365cfcf02.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"e4487e2f-dcf6-450b-b672-9646ee43dd6d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"2009b1ac-94eb-4c05-a0d1-b6235602195d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"7123af0a-f2a1-4e2b-837c-0e71a3d51a33.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"d3770736-3acf-4555-a5b9-9e64049f1912.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"1e6e3c38-7320-4a15-bf8c-d65584ee94cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"df8b8a8a-1d23-462e-96a2-cb406a4888aa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"5801f1f1-b91b-4f0f-8f8f-b4e136ee2ece.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"5fdff62b-33c6-4ee4-be7d-3727df45fd05.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"9ae718a6-0ed9-41e5-8949-e73852fcc2d5.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"d4ac2251-e2eb-49b0-a59d-2a63b2274dc4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"2ecdb64a-8824-419a-a96d-143d69fce074.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"c5f2cbff-151c-48b1-a018-a4e6508cc21a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"e634b59d-6b91-4153-a6bb-a737d70824a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":21742,"FileName":"f5137b81-8531-4b83-8aa8-b3c54c215cee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21741,"Name":"Star Trek: 25th Anniversary","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This 1991 release was intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the 60's television series.

Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate \"address\" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.\n\nThere are two game modes building on this basic concept:\n\n    Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.\n\n    Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Probe","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"e24dd843-7716-4443-a89c-18fdc3da2c39.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"eb284357-c0c5-4bea-8447-b071488e6f47.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"8de93be5-9f4a-439c-b27c-639bacf0fcf5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"7a03b57a-8b3c-46a0-b89e-2b5da0c3fd13.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"538495e3-60f4-4304-aef2-51a2df129288.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"b64c01cc-f08e-4c03-88b6-216aea8bda1d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"86c557dc-56db-47e6-bac9-98c594c451c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"97e49a45-84b0-488f-8603-8d21e4d32b0a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"70824a01-17ff-4268-ac09-22b092189622.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"2d0ee294-694a-4db9-bf99-43cf98c8f6ac.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"6bc55f71-bf89-4db2-b7bd-d1866b9d5b3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23342,"FileName":"21503baf-96ec-40c0-b17c-368ccb2f6479.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21740,"Name":"StarHawk","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Can You Survive the Ceaseless Attack of Freakish Alien Mutants?\n\nAs a master mariner aboard the scout ship StarHawk, you have been sent to explore the Evil Empire of Axtar.

The player takes the role of a sumo wrestler who has to cross five levels (each with three stages plus a boss) to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend. The protagonist has two means of attack: his fists and a stomp attack which, in addition to the damage, can stun enemies. Experience points are awarded for killing enemies, solving hidden mini games and collecting power-ups like health refreshments or temporary invincibility. Eventually this leads to a level up and the player can choose to upgrade one of the two attacks or increase his maximum health. The mini games are sumo wrestling, arm wrestling and thumb wrestling. All are reaction tests in which a button has to be pressed to stop a cursor moving left and right at the correct spot.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Kid","Publisher":"DTMC","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"39da9d6b-8adb-4c46-8201-15b4686fee40.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"3dc5beb0-5819-4a6d-b6f4-ef9d81397069.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"895a8aae-e6b6-4e73-acf0-2799c32dc558.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"498aa114-78b8-42f5-8e1a-82ab5cc46da4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"194bd24e-c671-459e-834f-aea8b6b13145.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"48df3fd6-ca55-48df-959c-f59b0ccf12bc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"e9195b19-69ab-4666-9453-f77eb3f1ed27.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"5c0f6e98-1950-4ac8-b794-cc52cfc4e2d9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"286118be-0005-4903-a89b-34ad640e3667.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"65d21144-24a9-42bd-9e0a-bfe04ef95f5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21619,"FileName":"70938637-baf9-4cd4-b524-337446d2e4f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":21619,"AlternateName":"Sumou Fighter: Toukaidou Basho","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":21648,"Name":"Sunsoft Grand Prix","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Drive the circuit's most challenging racecourse against the toughest drivers in the world.

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game.\n\nThis leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top.\n\nThe other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks.

Two spin-offs were also released: Crime City (1989) and Quiz H.Q.

Pro-AM","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super R.C. Pro-Am is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.\nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.\nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks.

As the intro tells, they live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as Gil Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive war.\n\nThe basic interface is like every other SRT game: your robots are placed out on a map grid with different terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for movement, attack, status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot close to an enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or negotiate. After all robots have moved, the turn is over, and the game switches to the enemy phase.\n\nAll robots are licensed from two parties only – Sunrise and Dynamic – and when starting the game you may choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be designated as the team leader, which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games, destroyed units are not repaired after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the negotiation command than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be friends. Few of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to a minimal amount, though.\n\nApart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that is destroyed, and a level up adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force, armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in conventional RPGs, allowing a unit-specific set of ”spiritual commands” to be executed. These usually change game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or health. Health is otherwise regenerated by putting a unit in one of the bases spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up item. These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and shields.\n\nEach battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive compared to later games in the series, even on the Game Boy, with little movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle you have initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or ranged. Ranged weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back – this is true even of enemy units which possess ranged weapons of their own. All weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which are altered according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or airborne.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Winky Soft","Publisher":"Banpresto","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"95ed1322-7c16-4fb8-ac4a-43af6405a25a.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"8946d784-6625-4b3e-a823-fb9ee51ffcbc.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"a270c118-44af-46f7-af05-4256065ffe95.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"63943df5-3045-454c-b54c-309a9ff93f6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"1e4c7af2-43d5-4818-825d-ddf498a3d8bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"b01208b7-4b98-4954-9a3a-43e00fc9b6c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"72ef82e3-4ec4-4367-8353-b73bb707880b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"8c342466-d7d7-4aeb-85cd-d23d830d18f4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156114,"FileName":"675cbe3d-ffa6-49c9-b1ea-c991d5f388d0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156114,"AlternateName":"Super Robot Wars","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":21774,"Name":"Super Scrabble","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"With all that Super Scrabble has to offer, even the most traditional Scrabble player will smile with delight.

A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day, renamed T2: The Arcade Game for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000.

Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.\n\nTamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all.\n\nUnlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options. You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The three games are:\n\n    Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it will face next.\n    Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.\n    Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky. Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point. \n\nAnother feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments.

There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.\n\nThe play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.\n\nThere are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.\n\nThere are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6nwEnt0Pp0","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Sculptured Software","Publisher":"Tecmo","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"64f503c0-633a-4c5e-853b-f62be908badc.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"a5a607f0-2fc7-4ca4-9b62-b288b8f0c6b6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"2f0744ec-e0a0-480a-8287-cc169b86fdd6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"21014efc-ed84-496a-8b5c-325493ffed4f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"d68091d4-255f-417e-b0d9-5f06b88ada27.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"e3092654-ba0c-480e-8cc0-fabb467754bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"45b777a5-33dd-4d7e-9abe-c1cdd23fe992.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"505d62e5-698d-4638-a036-dfa06b83a340.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"0118b13f-4a39-4a0e-b715-2b93941b5a7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21783,"FileName":"d0496b66-c7c7-45b6-895d-a13c9012f2a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":21783,"AlternateName":"Tecmo Bowl GB","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":6124,"Name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"STOP SHREDDER FROM ZAPPING THE WORLD FAMOUS SEWER STARS INTO PET STORE PEBBLE PUSHERS!\n\nShredder's got his criminal mind back in the gutter and has joined forces with fellow hero hater Krang to pulverize the pizza freaks once and for all.

Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send \"garbage blocks\" to the other player's playfield.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h_qETFoC94","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Intelligent Systems","Publisher":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1996-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"519187bb-0588-4cf3-ab8b-c1bf007b5d70.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"810c4723-bc8f-4dd0-b961-05dcaee042bf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"01ce7ffa-daeb-4046-8e33-57b8740a3503.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"29637369-4da0-469c-a35d-10ec5432956c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"96d76a84-ad12-4087-9031-93404336494d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"7d9b81ce-0376-4360-9a7e-e3f52b3a2e00.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"8a82ebaa-e410-484e-845a-ebb099810ea5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"285204d9-c0aa-4b2b-9a31-8617db50e56e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"2e203497-9722-4d5c-8a81-23631310cdee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"ebfc2840-9ebb-424e-9c59-b6d67372cbc4.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"d4000269-287f-48aa-939a-80559f4c5deb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"6acea792-b466-47fc-9c6b-18dd4ea65fa9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17486,"FileName":"e3103fdb-a32b-49e5-9912-cb21d47b82de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":17486,"AlternateName":"Yoshi no Panepon","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":21329,"Name":"Tetris Blast","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Have a BLAST!

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\n\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.\n\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"2663fe8a-9ab0-48b6-b537-8d83b4c164ee.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"ee512671-ba3f-4fd3-ae8a-974febc3a129.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"417eb85b-313b-4362-a8e3-d0b54858ae7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"a733fa49-cb37-4c44-91a6-9a354f74cfcf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"6e86e213-6eb1-4f7b-8a0c-d2006a58e481.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"e412ac15-d6ee-42fc-9c4e-7cbf0c1f169a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"f7f3924d-c13c-4f7b-80c3-175a785637a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24086,"FileName":"44b8128a-e483-432b-993e-cfb25081d842.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":24086,"AlternateName":"Virtual Wars","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":3193,"Name":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A Game Boy fantasy adventure like no other!\n\nNintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening.

There's no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level.\n\nEach level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There's also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level.\n\nThe game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level.\n\nIn spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.\n\nThe levels are copied from the Amiga game P.

Homer Simpson spits the beans out the window where they grow into a massive stalk reaching into the clouds.\n\nThe game is a platformer with some shooter elements. The player, as Bart, must jump between platforms and vines through all sorts of tricky hazards to the giant's castle in the clouds and make it back down alive. Bart can use his slingshot and various weapons he finds along the way to defeat the enemies that block his path. There are seven levels in total.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1994-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"4643607b-9021-47ac-b800-8df786bebc6b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"c346dbe9-5839-4fa9-b256-6a5e022e9aa8.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"e4158345-8fa8-4476-ab04-cc427e72cad0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"41c54214-f6a1-4e63-9002-b946d8901cb4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"edf331f9-8cfb-4e02-b01a-19e0babc07fb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"c864d99e-5624-40e9-bf30-493145d7d384.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":13058,"FileName":"6de690fe-4513-4017-8a6a-9fb36c5c08e3.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":13058,"AlternateName":"The Simpsons: Bart no Jack to Mame no Ki","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":21725,"Name":"The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Juggernauts","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bart Simpson here, on my way to the Springfield Arena to do battle with the Juggernauts, my all-time TV heroes.\n\nIt isn't going to be easy.

By combining these powers, the player can progress through each stage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Interbec","Publisher":"Interbec","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"5fd5b221-87a7-4b20-87b2-69d7653fd2a4.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"5ebfe88c-4e0c-4eb9-b7ad-fdd69b58aec5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"6ae75449-d191-4f9b-997b-e066b63f1c56.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"536a05fc-a051-45cd-b715-c6d7ded6eb94.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"df774118-1542-4190-92b2-ea1e293bf52a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"ff90db4b-0e54-4f0c-a0b1-cad2161676d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127733,"FileName":"6fa3b3e9-59d7-41f0-9cd4-8c69f8542f67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163191,"Name":"Ultraman Chou Toushi Gekiden","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Angel","ReleaseDate":"1994-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"55a4c706-5d07-46ba-8911-e604542308ce.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"c2f77b0c-7dda-4c47-87a2-ac5ff0880072.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"e989625a-11de-4fd7-805e-d314c09865d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"830430c1-dbc0-42f6-a5da-29f4fbde3226.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"7303a831-a5aa-4273-8177-566f25bd8a1a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"34d4c4ab-b23a-4048-9611-e011aeae5339.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163191,"FileName":"c9b659a8-65df-4516-911a-66445028dcaa.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":163191,"AlternateName":"Ultraman: Legend of the Super Warrior","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163190,"Name":"Ultraman Club: Tekikaijuu o Hakken seyo!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163190,"FileName":"d9354670-d174-44ae-a4d1-599ee0bf9ebc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163188,"Name":"Umi no Nushi Tsuri 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1998-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163188,"FileName":"86538d57-3ce2-49fc-9737-b495248ec215.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127637,"Name":"Un Indien Dans La Ville","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Un indien dans la ville (An Indian in the city) is a 1994 French film by Hervé Palud. \nThe film had a limited English language release under the title \"Little Indian, Big City\".\n\nIt was later adapted for an American audience under the title \"Jungle 2 Jungle\", set in Manhattan and starring Tim Allen and Martin Short. \nA tie in game for the Game Boy was released only in France.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Titus France","Publisher":"Titus Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127637,"FileName":"0c0f3341-3632-45ef-a7ee-faa60684f14f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127637,"FileName":"015e6592-8ba8-4805-911f-931e1d3eec7d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":127637,"FileName":"9e4a0ce5-631c-4cc7-a0ae-24614fcb91c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":127637,"AlternateName":"Little Indian, Big City","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":127637,"AlternateName":"Little Indian In Big City","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127637,"AlternateName":"Indien dans la Ville, Un","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":159379,"Name":"Undercover Cops Gaiden: Hakaishin Garumaa","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Undercover Cops: Gaiden: Hakaishin Garumaa is based on Irem's Undercover Cops arcade game. But whereas that title was a beat-em-up, Hakaishin Garumaa instead takes place as a turn-based board game RPG. Similar in design to the later Mario Party titles, players begin by choosing one of three of the undercover cops. The player begins at the start location of the board and must use one of their \"numbered value tiles\". If the number chosen is above 1, the player must compete on a slot machine to try to win a value up to what was written on the tile. Following that, the player is able to move the number value, which they have won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will activate events that include talking with characters, buying items and engaging in battle.\n\nBattles with enemies are handled by each side choosing one of the numbered tiles they own. The party with the higher number becomes the attacker and the lower value becomes the defender. Each side then chooses another numbered tile to determine the amount of \"effort\" put into the attack or defense as well as a position of the body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the turn's sequence plays out, with HP lost on a successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in battle, the player gains XP and gold.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtxJqBjSV60","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Board Game","Developer":"Irem","Publisher":"Irem","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":159379,"FileName":"0a831340-1193-4122-91b2-8b5a2f2068de.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159379,"FileName":"c952af9f-2e1d-4d3a-81e6-b3e20acb8914.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159379,"FileName":"0b36aee6-88dd-49bf-b57c-effae180f348.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159379,"FileName":"eb909b2f-c165-408b-bc26-1359833f0741.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":159379,"AlternateName":"Undercover Cops: Hakaishin Garumaa","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159379,"AlternateName":"Undercover Cops Gaiden","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":21801,"Name":"Universal Soldier","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Based on the major motion picture, this awesome action adventure takes you from the steaming shell-pocked jungles of Southeast Asia to laser-seared battlefields at home.\n\nYou are a perfectly engineered Universal Soldier with extraordinary skills and powers - locked in mortal combat against your old Vietnam foe, the villainous Sergeant Scott.

There are three types of levels: sailing on a raft while shooting everything that moves, diving underwater and platforming. In each stage, the goal is to reach the exit within the time limit and, in the platforming levels, to defeat a boss.

Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers.\nThrowing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters.\n[edit]Wrestlers\n\nThese wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting; Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Fujisankei Communications International","ReleaseDate":"1994-02-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"0616233a-7812-47b6-8bbd-71e93bd4448e.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"64a9938b-dd20-45c6-8f61-5a0e40838657.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"3992aa4d-f0b1-4011-be48-532db773b483.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"5cede9fe-0702-41db-b929-ce5079696109.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"79739c2e-a86e-4068-ac13-8ab0b853bb6b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"f1a675f2-598c-490c-9a68-988946055619.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14454,"FileName":"e7120aa2-f2f5-43be-a2c0-d7d936f2a831.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":14454,"AlternateName":"WCW: The Main Event","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163181,"Name":"Wedding Peach: Jamapii Panic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wedding Peach: Jamapii Panic is a Puzzle game, developed by Atelier Double and published by KSS, which was released in Japan in 1995.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Atelier Double","Publisher":"KSS","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163181,"FileName":"2efc536a-a7fb-4137-8172-66f8bac9b8d0.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163181,"FileName":"01d070a5-9360-461e-9a19-b49b186c9b93.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163181,"FileName":"760792f0-acaa-46fa-bcc6-d44ea06a8794.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163181,"FileName":"2bcb127c-ae80-41e6-8d06-11b7ab64fcca.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":163181,"AlternateName":"Jama-P Panic!","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":135187,"Name":"Welcome Nakayoshi Park","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"In the game, the player walks around Nakayoshi park, playing different mini-games.

To win the game, all alleys have to be beaten in a row with an increasing points requirement (200 to 250) - if the score is missed once, it is back to the beginning.\n\nThe player can set the weight of the bowling ball: a heavier ball has more power but this goes in turn with a loss of control. It also depends on the chosen player character: the male is better with heavy balls while the female character should use a lighter one. The throw itself is divided into three parts: character position on the alley, control and power. While the first is simply chosen by lining the character up, the latter two are reaction games: a marker goes from left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to hit the button when the marker reaches the desired point.

The game was developed and published by Nintendo, with assistance from Argonaut Software. X was followed by an internationally released DSiWare exclusive sequel, X-Scape, in 2010.\n\n\nThe game was influenced by the Starglider series, and was originally slated to be published by Mindscape as Eclipse or Lunar Chase, but Nintendo took over the project after becoming interested in the concept of having three-dimensional graphics on the Game Boy. Then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi renamed the game X, shortly before its release. The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu listed X as one of the four most influential Game Boy games released, as it was the first 3D game released for a portable system in Japan.\n\n\nThe game takes place in a wireframe 3D view. The player controls the VIXIV to complete various missions assigned by the Training Academy Coach. Objectives can range from destroying enemy targets, escorting cargo, or defending bases. A short break is provided after the completion of each mission, and the player is awarded a number of stars based on their skill in each level. 10 small stars equal one regular star, and a certain number of stars are needed to continue the game after failing a mission. The game is completed by finishing all ten missions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETr1NoteMM","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Argonaut Software","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1992-05-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34676,"FileName":"aa5eb355-eaec-4577-b8a1-000e04d4504e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34676,"FileName":"6ac4a873-af57-4541-abdf-4156ebc353a0.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34676,"FileName":"818378a9-daac-40bb-ab27-1e0d214aff46.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34676,"FileName":"b66a7755-57b3-4163-b6e2-398b858c5df6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34676,"FileName":"e505792d-f9f0-4742-8be2-2cdc79639635.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34676,"FileName":"bc4dfacd-726e-4ec2-b58b-d6b92bc99239.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":34676,"AlternateName":"Lunar Chase","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":34676,"AlternateName":"Ekkusu エックス","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34676,"AlternateName":"X (エックス Ekkusu)","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":21813,"Name":"Xenon 2: Megablast","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Xenites are back and the very fabric of time is in danger.

The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park, and hidden by him in twelve safes somewhere in the park. The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake).\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple: using Yogi, the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen; to kill certain enemies the hero must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them; he has to avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well.\n\nThere are no true power-ups; instead, there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage, a 100 of which will grant the player an extra life. Likewise, there are icons labeled \"1-UP\" that will give the player a life, as well as health-refilling items. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes.

Its protagonist is Zool, a gremlin \"Ninja of the Nth Dimension\" who is forced to land on Earth; in order to gain ninja ranking, he has to pass seven lands, beating a boss at the end of each of them. The game contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano or finding certain invisible warp points.\n\nDevelopment and release\n-------------------------------------\nZool was intended as a rival to Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. George Allen came with the idea of Zool as he was criticized on his previous game Switchblade II for having a lack of enemies. In development, Zool could cast spells to get him out of trouble by collecting potions. For example, Zool could escape from pits with high jump spells and cast a shadow spell to make a clone of him that follows his actions (thus doubling the fire power). In the final version, the spells were replaced with collectible powerups. The very early name for the project was Pootz. The soundtrack by Patrick Phelan overlaps with the Lotus 3 soundtrack and inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. The game was heavily hyped upon its initial release, including being bundled with the newly launched Amiga 1200, although not the AGA version with enhanced graphics which followed later. In 2000, the Amiga version of Zool was re-released as part of The Best of Gremlin compilation.\n\nZool was also ported to the Atari ST, Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Amiga CD32, PC, and RISC OS platform, as well as for the arcade machines. The Amiga CD32 version has original red book audio tracks by Neil Biggin and has the option to have both sound effects and music. This and the Acorn Archimedes port are the only two incarnations of the original Amiga version to have this. Most computer ports are close to the Amiga original but the Genesis and SNES ports are very different with different levels which are smaller (likely due to shortage of RAM), different graphics and bosses. The SNES port is also very buggy with a low horizontal resolution, which makes it easier to run into enemies and being overall a slower game.\n\nTwo young adult novels book based on the games, entitled Cool Zool and Zool Rules, were released in February 1995. They were written by Stan Nicholls and Ian Edginton and published by Boxtree. The Game Maker's Companion (APress, 2010), a book on hobbyist game development, contains step-by-step instructions on how to re-make the original Zool game using GameMaker: Studio.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcjYQYfdJpQ","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software","Publisher":"GameTek","ReleaseDate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"587216e7-96b2-4efc-90ba-0c33b3510bb7.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"fd536d25-dbb9-4961-8d53-5abc6bbccdae.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"59e4ec34-efba-4871-9097-fa020d110cbd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"08cf6631-eb30-46aa-bf8d-2dc053026e82.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"fa7431e2-08dc-42b9-a604-631f24232e4e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"505cf6d4-159a-49f0-8de7-509e2b2a44be.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"bd7a5af4-9a8d-49d8-928b-9f9231e2c022.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"4aaf7e98-7862-451a-8144-e591a35c1c14.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"e423186f-0fd1-4a7c-9c27-af2758e88df9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"d1ee3035-37ba-4bbc-a548-8083cbd25f4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21817,"FileName":"efd34c4e-b994-4aab-a2c2-6ad35619ddc1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":21817,"AlternateName":"Zool","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":21818,"Name":"Zoop","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Level after level of brain-burning action coming at you from all sides, faster and faster until your thumbs are numb, your eyes are aching and your mind is molten.
