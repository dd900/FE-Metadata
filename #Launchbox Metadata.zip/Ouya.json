You install the emulators and then use Nostalgia's configuration menu to set the emulator to use and the rom directory AND go out and fetch the best shot at the cover art and descriptions for the games. Once those steps are done you will have a fancy new menu for each of your emulated systems with cover art and all.\n\nNostalgia is still in development. Ideas are always welcome!\nCome chat about Nostalgia in the unofficial ouya chat in IRC (#whouya on freenode)\n\nAs always, Nostalgia only costs $1 to unlock fully and permanently.\n\nThe ONLY limitation in demo mode is that you can only select one game system to launch an emulator.
