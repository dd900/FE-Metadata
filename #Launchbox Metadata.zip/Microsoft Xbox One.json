Garrett, a master thief who has been away from his hometown for a long time, returns to it, a city named 'The City', and finds it ruled over by a tyrant called 'The Baron'. While The City is infested by a plague, the rich continue to live in good fortune, and Garrett intends to exploit the situation to his favor.\n\nPlayers control Garrett, a master thief, as he intends to steal from the rich. Similar to previous games in the series, players must use stealth in order to overcome challenges, while violence is left as a minimally effective last resort.\n\nGameplay is choice-driven, with players having a number of possible paths and approaches in a given level. Players may use the environment to their advantage, as well as pickpocket characters. As Garrett attempts to steal in levels, guards and other non-player characters (if they are aware of his presence) will try to flush him out and kill him. Different NPCs may use different means to find him, and the game's artificial intelligence will be aware of the level design, and therefore, know of potential hiding spots.\n\nPlayers may enter a \"Focus\" mode, which provides several advantages. It enhances Garrett's vision, highlighting pipes that can be climbed, or candles that can be put out to make the area darker.

The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise. \n\nPowered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, EA SPORTS UFC brings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game. \n\nFeel the Fight – Gameplay Features \nStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight. \n\n• MMAi – A mixed martial artist’s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight. \n\n• Full Body Deformation – Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter’s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression. \n\n• Real-Time Exertion – A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world. \n\n• Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations – EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon. \n\n• Precision Movement – MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns. \n\n• Dynamic Striking – A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight. \n\n• Strategic Submission Battles – To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat. EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission. \n\n• Real Damage – Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day. EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2014-06-17T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ViZ6eX1UjQQ"},"20753":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rebellion","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"63d08fa7-463a-43dc-a9d1-fdb36719367b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9c03f4d2-1e34-46de-a42a-1a76bcf45a20.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5397e85a-e905-4ae7-9cd5-bec83aef9d90.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8fa42935-e954-4f97-80e9-e9c524e6864f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2a754a13-15fe-4bba-b0cd-dda52ab7fa66.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sniper Elite III","Overview":"The latest chapter in the award winning series, Sniper Elite 3 takes players to the unforgiving yet exotic terrain of WW2’s North Africa conflict in a battle against a deadly new foe.\n\nEquipped with Tiger tanks and the latest weaponry, Germany’s infamous Afrika Korps have the Allies outnumbered and outgunned.

The gameplay is reminiscent of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, with the player taking direct control of characters and taking them on missions and large-scale battles.\n\nThe game focuses on the stories of Class Zero, a group of twelve magic-endowed students from the Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. One day, the Milites Empire launches an assault on the other nations of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals. When Rubrum is attacked, Class Zero are called into action and become entangled in both the efforts to push back and defeat the forces of Milites, and the secret behind the war and the existence of the crystals. The setting and presentation was inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.\n\nThe game was originally announced as a title for mobile phones called Final Fantasy Agito XIII (アギトXIII Agito Sātīn?). It is directed by Hajime Tabata, who also directed Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. It was designed to provide players with easy access to the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. The game was eventually moved onto the PSP and its title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, the subseries' flagship title. The HD port began development in mid-2012 as part of a move to promote the next generation of gaming consoles. The original game has received strong sales and positive reception in Japan, inspiring multiple tie-in mangas. A prequel\/companion game, Final Fantasy Agito, was released on May 14, 2014 in Japan","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-15T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bedq4m8a_8U"},"21412":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"681c0204-38c9-4200-a514-1985f4172171.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"46c9681e-aaef-4e33-9b4c-f563e5223e90.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9fb0402d-ce9f-4c42-8dce-00d4ee079871.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"952082e7-4f1f-4c39-9849-824cdba346df.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9b504a08-3b01-4391-be31-a45de0cbe739.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b4f25d29-2871-4f31-915d-9a24a4b3b33e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2989b2e0-72fa-414e-8a4a-19e411bbad33.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Assassin's Creed: Unity","Overview":"Paris, 1789.

Upon release of this title, Pinball FX was de-listed and its tables made available as downloadable content (DLC) for the sequel. For the PC and Xbox One this is the first game in the series. The game works as a hub, allowing players to purchase and play downloadable tables. All tables can be played freely for a few minutes. They are permanently unlocked or added by purchasing them as DLC. Major updates from Pinball FX include a revised physics engine and various graphical updates. Tables have six to eight different view options, along with optional supplementary effects like floating points numbers, a ball trail, or a picture-in-picture skillshot camera showing the next target on the table. The table's active LED display is also shown within a window, and can be moved to one of the four corners of the screen. Separate windows appear when the player is close to specific milestones (such as a high score, beating a friend, or moving up in the leaderboard).\n\nPlayers use the left and right triggers to control the respective flippers. Balls are shot into play either using a mechanical trigger or an analog plunger. You can also freeze the game and enter a free look mode, where they navigate a zoomed camera around the table to get a better sense of the layout. When this is activated high scores are not saved.\n\nAll tables include a rules sheet that explains each mini-game's activation criteria and goals. An authentic operator's menu (driven through the LED display) allows loading difficulty presets, run light, and sound tests on the virtual circuitry, reset each table's local high scores, and calibrate aspects of each table (such as flipper strength and tilt sensitivity). While most of the tables are grounded in reality and based on physical pinball parts, the virtual nature is occasionally used to do things physical tables could not - figures on the table move and interact with the ball, some tables have secondary modes (like a day-to-night cycle, or temporary zero gravity), and objects are sometimes flown into or out of the table.\n\nMultiplayer options include split-screen, simultaneous over internet, or local hot seat for up to four players. Ranked multiplayer uses fixed rules where the players have infinite balls and try to be the first to reach a target score or highest score in a time limit. Unranked multiplayer can be customized. Leaderboards are also driven by Superscores and Wizard Scores. A player's Superscore is the player's highest score on each table, rounded to the nearest million. A player's Wizard Score is their Superscore, plus the Superscore of anyone on their Friends list, times the number of tables they own. The system encourages interaction, competition, and of course, buying more tables.\n\nOn the Xbox 360 players who purchase the game as a Core pack (for 800 MSP) get four new tables: Biolab, Pasha, Rome, and Secrets of the Deep. On the Xbox 360 and also by default on PC, players can download the free version, play every table in a limited time trial mode, and\/or purchase and play DLC tables. On Xbox 360 the Pinball FX Classic pack ports over Speed Machine, Agents, Buccaneer, and Extreme from the original game. Each table has its own set of three achievements, usually tied to winning mini-games \/ missions. None of the core tables from Pinball FX or Pinball FX2 are available for the PSN's Zen Pinball, though many of the DLC tables can be purchased for either. The PC and Xbox One versions contain the full and unrestricted table Sorcerer's Lair for free. For Xbox One tables previously purchased for the Xbox 360 version can be imported for free. The Xbox One version has a new overview system where tables (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.) are grouped together in separate tabs, along with a tab for all your purchased tables.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2014-08-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hQbSgh1DnCE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pinball_FX_2"},"24263":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Yuke's","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"26c24ba7-b9f5-449c-a4d1-b333ac6227cc.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"83700bf2-1644-4bda-ab6c-c77a3dd2a1f7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1fe954ee-4905-453c-92bd-decf9d4d2c88.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"WWE 2K15","Overview":"WWE 2K15 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and is published by 2K Sports for the PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 4 (PS4), Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows PC.

In the Screamrider mode, players can ride and take control of the coasters, with an aim of keeping riders from falling off the coaster.[1] In the Demolition Expert mode, players are tasked with demolishing environments and objects to meet various conditions in order to gain points by throwing cabins with people. All parts of the roller coaster are destructible. Removing any single part will naturally cause derailment of the coasters. Destroying the coaster will also lead to the destruction of buildings. Well placed coaster destruction could lead to explosion, chain reaction and the collapse of a skyscraper.[2] There is also a sandbox mode, which allow players to build coasters with extreme designs with props, ride pieces and modular scenery. Players can create coasters, amusements and environments from the ground-up.[3] Although the game does not feature multiplayer, it features an online leaderboard. On Xbox One, players can also take control of coasters shared and created by other players through Xbox Live.[4] They can also race with others to ride a coaster as fast as possible and gain \"scream rating\" through the process.

The focus of the game has been shifted to police and the \"war on crime\", breaking away from the military setting that has hitherto characterized the series. As such, the main factions in Hardline are the police Special Response Units and criminals. Players will have access to various military-grade weapons and vehicles, such as the Lenco BearCat, as well as having police equipment such as tasers and handcuffs.\n\nHardline also uses the Levolution mechanic from Battlefield 4. For example, in the map \"Downtown\" players can send a construction crane crashing into the building, ripping down debris from the central buildings in downtown, which falls down on the streets of Los Angeles. But, this time, every map features multiple levolutionary events, both small and gigantic.\n\nMany new game modes are featured in Hardline, for instance: Heist, Rescue, Hotwire Mode, Blood Money and Crosshair Mode.\n\nHeist: The criminals must break into a cash filled vault (or as featured in some maps, blow open the doors of an armoured truck) then move the cash filled packages to an extraction point; the police must stop them. If the Criminals manage to escape by bringing all the money to the extraction point they win.\n\nBlood Money: Both factions must retrieve money from an open crate in the center of the map, then move it back to their respective side's armored truck. Players can also steal money from the opposing team's truck. The team that first deposits $5 million worth of money into their truck or the team with the most money under a time limit wins.\n\nHotwire Mode: Drivable cars take the role of traditional Conquest \"flags.\" Like Conquest, capturing cars (done by driving above a certain \"cruising\" speed) will bleed the enemy team's reinforcement tickets. The team who reduces the other's to zero or who has the most tickets remaining after the time limit wins.\n\nRescue: In a 3 minute long 5 vs 5 competitive mode, S.W.A.T officers must try to rescue hostages held by criminal forces. The cops win by either rescuing the hostage(s) or by killing all the criminals. Criminals win by killing all the cops. Each player has only one life in this mode, that means no respawns.\n\nCrosshair: The second competitive game mode in Battlefield Hardline. Crosshair is also 3 minutes long, 5 vs 5 with only one life. In Crosshair the criminals are trying to kill a player controlled VIP on the cops side who is a former gang member turned states witness. The criminals win by killing the VIP and the cops win by getting the VIP to the extraction point.\n\nVisceral Games ratified that the single-player campaign will not be linear and promised to deliver a better one than the predecessors. The campaign will feature episodic crime dramas where choices will heavily change situational outcomes and gameplay experiences. As a cop, players can use multiple police gadgets and personal equipments. The police badge can be used to strike fear into criminals' hearts and order them to lay down their weapons, the scanner is used to stake out a situation, identify high value-targets, log evidences, tag alarms, and mark other threats. To slip past unnoticed, players can use bullet cases to distract enemies.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2015-03-17T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cx929uwxGu0"},"26267":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NetherRealm Studios","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"560dc10d-9cc8-4461-a60c-6f4dec7f4cd3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f189e5c7-80f5-4ee1-8f95-a3fad82fae44.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6bdca487-0203-48d8-bad8-2e335224059f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Mortal Kombat X","Overview":"Mortal Kombat X is a fighting video game developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros.

It was released on May 5, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game is a stand-alone expansion pack in the Wolfenstein series, and a prequel to 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order. Set in an alternate history 1946, the single-player story follows war veteran William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and his efforts to discover the locations of a Nazi compound. Development began in 2014, soon after the release of The New Order.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress through the story. It is separated into two interconnected campaigns. The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, and explosives, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present; players lean in and out of cover instead of the more common system where players lock into cover.\n\nWolfenstein: The Old Blood was met with a generally positive reception upon release. Many critics praised the game's intense firefights, intriguing locations, and the balance between stealth and action. Many critics disliked the game's story however, with most reviewers saying it was the weakest part of the game, and that it is a step back compared to The New Order‍ '​s story, which was heavily complimented.","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2015-05-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fxVEpo_35sA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wolfenstein:_The_Old_Blood"},"29226":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bethesda Game Studios","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"c745ff83-e02e-4b10-a300-c1d6ae7b1276.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a00ee558-4bcc-4716-aefc-a3acc51b4de9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"785cfdac-db9b-4f99-b18a-e95de95a04af.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fallout 4","Overview":"As the sole survivor of Vault 111, you enter a world destroyed by nuclear war.

The game is a purely sandbox experience without story elements. The player instead simply lands in the middle of a desolate snow covered rural area completely alone, and is expected to immediately start battling the elements in order to survive. \n\nIn its sandbox form, this is a perma-death game with no win condition that isn't externally motivated (by leaderboards or achievements). A small number of challenges can be chosen at the start of the game to add more specific objectives and win conditions to the gameplay.\n\nThe main gameplay consists of exploring the five interconnected maps of the game world in search of shelter, equipment and resources, while managing the character's basic needs (hunger, thirst, body temperature, fatigue, encumbrance, health) and avoiding dangerous animals. These game maps are persistent, however the available equipment that spawns in them is randomized. \n\nThere is no character creation, but there is a skill system that levels up by use and improves the player's efficiency at different tasks. One can harvest wood and plants, fish, hunt, manage their inventory and craft items (tools, food and medication). Most equipment and clothes can also be repaired through the crafting system, provided one has the necessary resources and tools available.\n\nWith a day-night system, dynamic weather and an animal AI that tries to simulate real behaviour, the game attempts to mimic a survival experience in a natural environment with some degree of realism. However the amount of available wildlife is limited: One can trap rabbits, hunt deer, and hunt or be hunted by wolves and bears. The dangerous animals can be fought off through a rudimentary combat system (melee or ranged), avoided through a basic stealth (line of sight) system or distracted\/scared away with flares. Hunting is done with a bow, pistol or rifle, the latter two being dependent on finding some of the limited available ammunition.\n\nThe relatively low amount of dangerous enemies, slow pace and emphasis on atmosphere and exploration of the game mean that The Long Dark differentiates itself from the majority of survival games of its era by pitting the player against nothing but a hostile natural environment.","Publisher":"Hinterland Studio","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ECHnqMklU1A"},"30838":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"343 Industries","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e2e1eb24-d2ee-4465-8478-d2266065faf2.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"16dcdf5b-9596-442f-8122-7bc650429fe2.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"65d8b876-83d4-435f-9a5c-fd4a93a23f25.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"755f9638-8ff3-451a-8ef0-e6a4ea4a888c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ffd125d7-6f10-42da-8bd9-25a05a9c96dd.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"Halo 3: ODST","Overview":"Halo 3: ODST happens mostly at the same time of the events of Halo 2 and the very beginning of Halo 3.

The new VISR visor system can provide light amplification and is used to identify friends and foes. The visor also provides map, navigation data, and link-up with the AIs that run the city. The players are also no cybernetic super-soldiers this time; player stamina and health are bigger factors than before, and both the speed and jump height are scaled back.\n\nThe game features a Firefight mode, a four-player cooperative game mode that is centered around the campaign. Rather than the hardcore sci-fi of previous editions, ODST has influences of film noir and jazz-like elements to complement the soundtrack.\n\nHalo 3: ODST also includes Halo 3: Mythic, which is essentially a stripped-down, multiplayer-only version of Halo 3, and includes all Halo 3 downloadable maps, including Heroic, Legendary, and Mythic map packs and three previously unreleased maps.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2015-05-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"DLC"},"31110":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Frogwares","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"15e9cb83-0150-434b-b744-ded5ad545e0b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cceb1943-7636-4f38-a7e6-979a59478f10.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments","Overview":"In Crimes & Punishments: Sherlock Holmes, the player controls the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The game is set in the late 19th century and, in contrast to the predecessors, tells not one big case but six smaller, independent ones. Three of them are original stories and two (The Fate of Black Peter and The Abbey Grange Affair) are based on Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The Riddle on the Rails takes the basic premise of Doyle's story The Lost Train, but the rest of the story is original. All cases involve Holmes investigating a murder.\n\nSolving crimes has four main components. The first part is investigating the environment: here the player controls Holmes either in first or third-person (the point & click interface of the predecessors is no longer available) and navigates him through the scenes, e.g. a garden or a mansion. When Holmes walks near something interesting, a notification pops up and after pressing a button, Holmes will make an observation or interact with the object. In some cases the game switches to first-person detail view of the object, e.g. a shelve, and the player moves a cursor in search for more hot-spots. When a smaller object is viewed in detail mode, it can be rotated. \"Finished\" hot-spots are marked and detail views are automatically exited when there is no more information to be found. Additionally there are two special viewing modes available which can be turned on when investigating the environment: instinct (allows Holmes to find small details) and imagination (Holmes recreates past events in his mind). Because those viewing modes are mandatory to find certain clues, there is a notification when they should be used.\n\nThe second component is interrogating suspects and witnesses. When entering conversation, Holmes has a number of topics to choose from. This results usually in an automatic dialogue between Holmes and the other persons, but in some cases Holmes can cut in when the person is lying. Then he is presented with a number of rebuttals and has to choose the correct one. Those are either previously collected clues or come from Holmes' deductions about the person: like in the novels, Holmes closely inspects the person's outside for conclusions about character and history. From a gameplay perspective, it is similar to the object detail view: moving a cursor over the person and clicking on hot-spots.\n\nThe third component are mini games which are frequently encountered while processing evidence or searching the environment, e.g. when opening a lock. The gameplay of those mini games have a wide range and can be puzzles, action-based or simply using things in the correct sequence. While most are short, some like creating a time-table of events can be a bit more involved. All mini games can be skipped. Additionally there are some inventory-based puzzles in which Holmes has to collect a few things to (automatically) use with another thing. \n\nThis all comes together in the fourth component: deductions. They are performed on a separate screen and lead to the resolution of the case. First there is a cluster of all clues Holmes has found so far and the player has to choose two which belong together and form a deduction, e.g. \"the victim was shot\" and \"the revolver has one bullet missing\" may lead to the deduction \"the victim was shot with the revolver\". Multiple deductions together lead to another deduction and eventually to the murderer or the next step to take in the investigation, e.g. a recreation of the crime. However, many clues can be interpreted differently and this is the player's job: choosing between two alternatives based on everything what was learned - different interpretations lead to different results. In the end, the player is free to choose the conclusion and the game does not prevent accusing the wrong suspect. However, after the case the player can optionally view if the choice was correct and jump back to the last decision. There is also always a moral choice to take which boils down to hitting the murderer with the full charge of the law or being lenient.\n\nAs the cases are independent, those choices don't have impact besides a letter or newspaper story which can be picked up during the next case. While most environments are exclusive to the case and are opened up one after another, there are two places which are visited in almost every case: Holmes' and Watson's home (used for research, processing evidence and changing Holmes' appearance) and Scotland Yard (used for interrogating arrested suspects and inspect their belongings, visit the morgue or converse with Inspector Lestrade). The player almost exclusively controls Holmes; other characters like Watson or the sniffer dog Toby are only controlled in a few sequences.","Publisher":"Focus Home Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31111":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"RE-LOGIC","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"560dfe49-5f96-42f5-8e0e-bcffe434d8a1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"510421d2-81af-4321-bafb-b95d5bc45c71.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Terraria","Overview":"Terraria is a two dimensional platform game of exploration and crafting.

To do this, the other team must either break through the castle gate with siege weapons or use ladders to ascend the walls and breach the castle. Once in they have to tear down the Big Tower to emerge victorious. Each team's castle however has defense weapons such as explosives, cannons and ballistas to ward off attackers.\n\nIf a team has not breached the other's castle by the end of the time limit then the game is decided by how many towers each team possesses by the end of the match. They can range from one to seven depending upon the map size and they also function as spawn points for teams. If each team has the same amount of towers by the end of the game it will be sent into sudden death and the first team to build the winning tower wins the match.\n\nThere are three classes to choose from, Warrior, Cleric and Mage, each with their own set of weapons, items and skills. Warriors are frontline soldiers who charge into battle with swords and shield, attempting to bash their way through the enemy. Cleric is more of a support role and can heal and even resurrect fallen allies as well as build siege weapons. Mages are the magic class which can enchant an ally's weapon to be more destructive and can cast devastating spells upon the enemy team and have no shield unlike the Warrior and Cleric. Instead they can fire range spells to ward off attackers.\n\nThere are three sets of skills with three different slots (9 in total), each different for their respective class and they are unlockable in the game randomly through experience points the player earns by defeating enemies, building or destroying siege weapons and towers. Warriors can unleash devastating attacks as well as throw rocks to disorient enemies, Clerics can heal allies and summon materials for siege weapons and Mages can enchant weapons as well as call in devastating range attacks. Additionally there is a Team Skill which requires several allies to work, Warriors can use rush a crowd of enemies with a group, Clerics can teleport groups of allies to friendly towers and they even have a spell that will turn their enemies into flowers for instant hit kills. Mages can call in devastating meteor strikes and tornadoes that can ravage a massive area on the battlefield.\n\nPlayers can customize up to three different characters for each class and equip them with weapons, armor, shields and accessories they unlock in battles. Depending upon their performance and level the player is, the better the item will be. Items can be buffed and leveled up by using lower grade weapons to give them special abilities and more devastating power and damage. While the player can unlock these items in game, they can also buy them using the in-game currency and get premium items.\n\nThe currency of the game consists of Happy Stars and Happy Tickets with stars being acquired through games and the amount depending upon their performance. The player can use these stars in a game called The Happy Spinner where they can bet up to 900 stars and receive weapons, shields, armor, etc. Happy Tickets are bought through Microsoft points and are used to buy premium items through Happy Cards which will give the player a random set of items, from common to rare.\n\nIn July of 2013, an update was added where it added mission objectives in which the player would be rewarded with Happy Stars, Weapons and even Happy Tickets for completing certain objectives from completing the tutorial to leveling up a character to buffing weapons. Additionally a new class was added called the Berserker, a warrior class that uses dual weapons instead of a shield and has new attacks such as double spin attack, blade throw and a rage yell that increases damage for a short period of time.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31419":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Turn 10 Studios","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"8c309a8f-520c-4599-a01d-e07963027f82.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"99108a96-3744-4bbd-b766-d764da1ff5f7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"75f697c9-3677-4e02-84f7-540213d30b13.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"22b703fb-7d59-402e-9d4d-d67eec2611e6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":24,"Name":"Forza Motorsport 6","Overview":"Take a spin in some of the slickest cars on the road in the sixth entry of the Forza Motorsport racing series.

The emulated games span multiple genres and consoles—from the ZX Spectrum to the Xbox 360—and retain the features and errors of their original releases with minimal edits. The compilation adds cheats to make the older games easier and a Snapshots mode of specific challenges culled from parts of the games. Player progress is rewarded with behind-the-scenes footage and interviews about Rare's major and unreleased games.\n\nThe compilation was one of several ideas Rare considered to celebrate their 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backwards compatibility features, and the idea to connect Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. They prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay was announced at the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews. Rare's Nintendo 64 classics, with Blast Corps in particular, were the communal favorites, while Perfect Dark Zero, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, and the Spectrum games were liked least. Critics appreciated the package's design and craft and considered the release a high-water mark for compilation releases. Reviewers were disappointed by the absence of the Donkey Kong Country series and GoldenEye 007 due to inevitable licensing issues, while a few thought the package was fine without them. Critics considered the archival game content and developer interviews among the compilation's best features, and were upset to see the content hidden behind time-consuming in-game challenges. Reviewers noted that Rare's founders, the Stamper brothers, were conspicuously absent from the interviews. Critics had high praise for the \"rewind\" and Snapshot features, and criticized technical issues in the Xbox 360 emulation and game installation. Rare Replay became Rare's first United Kingdom all-format charts bestseller since Banjo-Kazooie in 1998.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TGGNuTlNxu8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rare_Replay"},"32138":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Canada","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"337f5dfa-1c37-41ed-a909-f123f49c34d1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dea527e7-5568-41d0-bcd6-369aa904214b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"NHL 16","Overview":"NHL 16 is a hockey video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports.

It is the fourth game in the Elite series and the sequel to the 1995 Frontier: First Encounters. It is set in an open world based on the real Milky Way and it is persistent in the way that it started in the year 3300 when it was launched in 2014 and time runs in sync with ours. As in the previous games the player starts with a small ship and a limited amount of 'credits' and needs to make a name by exploring an enormous galaxy said to contain 400 billion star systems. There are both noble and infamous paths to follow with many different types of jobs involving bounty hunting, exploring, fighting, mining, piracy, smuggling or trading, but always with the goal of acquiring capital to invest in larger ships, advanced equipment and cargo bays to store goods. There is a laws and crime system in place tied to a reputation. The game has fines and bounties, but players can also buy insurance.\n\nWhile the single-player of the previous games remains, there is an important persistent element as the choices of the different players across their own games impact the larger open-ended narrative. The game also needs a constant internet connections as the economy is based on the global player action by buying or selling resources and how the three factions (Alliance, Empire and Federation) interact through Power Play: galaxy-wide faction-based challenges. There are cycles in place that are re-calculated every week based on extensive systems involving financial, political and social weight that can be directly influenced by players, for instance by pledging to or withdrawing support from powers. Expansion on the map can be achieved in the same way. A Solo mode can be played to never encounter a human player, but there is also real multiplayer, either the Open Play mode as a large free-for-all or working cooperatively, or the Private mode to only play with a select number of friends. During space travel players encounter stars, planets, moons, black holes and asteroid fields.\n\nSpace flight is a simulation in the sense that there are a lot of controls to master and interpreting the HUD with afterburner, cargo, communications, compass, docking, fuel, heat, hull, landing gear, lasers, power, scanning, shields, speed, transactions etc. Travelling is done through standard space flight, hyperspace jumps or super cruise. During fights many types of manoeuvres are supporting through engine boosts, pitch, roll, throttle, thrust and yaw. Ships are customized through large amount of modules such as drives, fuel scoop, fuel tank, heat sink launcher, life support, power distributor, power plant, sensors, shield generator, weapons etc.","Publisher":"Frontier Developments","ReleaseDate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dwvjElmFCfE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elite:_Dangerous"},"32765":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cyanide","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"8a1bb68f-ab96-4116-8429-d0f2ce81673d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"001ffb9c-c696-4666-ae6c-89101b989016.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4a0a27aa-5790-4206-b8da-1c86aea40370.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd577f5f-5a4b-4489-b79c-99c8afd876c0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Le Tour de France Season 2015","Overview":"Assume the role of a professional rider competing in the “Grande Boucle”.

The game begins with character creation with four classes (Dragon Knight, Nightblade, Sorcerer and Templar). The game consists of three factions with three races each: Aldmeri Dominion (Altmer, Bosmer and Khajiit), Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc and Redguard) and Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Dunmer and Nord). A tenth race, Imperials, is exclusively available through a collector's edition of the game. Regardless of the chosen option, the story always starts with the character as a prisoner with amnesia in Coldharbour. Just like the other games in the franchise it is set in Tamriel with many ties in the storyline to the other games. It offers the entire continent for players to explore, with a specific region for each of the three factions, and certain regions locked off and saved for future expansions. It is set 1,000 years before The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and circa 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The main antagonist is the Daedric Prince Molag Bal who attempts to fuse Tamriel with Coldharbour through dark anchors. These giant anchors are shot at random intervals, can be seen from a large distance and act as large events similar to those in RIFT.\n\nThe game does not entirely follow the open environments and storyline from the previous games. Instead, each faction has its own campaign with a linear progress through regions. They consist of elements typical for the series, such as large cities to visit, dungeons, quests, and various characters to talk to. Eventually the campaigns bring the three factions together in the central region of Cyrodiil to join the Alliance War that provides the PvP section of the game. In that area each faction wrestles for territory control, resource nodes and travel routes with its own strongholds. It also emphasizes control over the Elder Scrolls, powerful artifacts that can be stolen and need to be taken to the faction's stronghold, and benefit every member of the faction that holds them. The idea is that power and balance will constantly shift as two factions will work together to retrieve the scrolls from the one that holds them. There are siege weapons to attack strongholds and the highest ranking player of the faction that controls the Ruby Throne in Imperial City is crowned emperor. When fighting for a faction points are earned during scouting or bounty missions that can be used to buy resources for the faction. The game uses a scaling battle system where lower-ranked players can still take on higher level players, starting from level 10.\n\nOther game elements where players can work together include boss monsters, Delves (mini-dungeons), regular dungeons (for four to twelve players), and Dolmens, a cycling sequence of waves of monsters. Unlike many other MMORPGs players are not divided over separate realms tied to a server, as the game puts all players together in a single environment with dynamic population assignment. Attacking does not rely on auto actions and automatic targeting. Instead, it puts more emphasis on movement (positioning, evading) and free-flowing attacks based on magic, ranged, light and heavy weapons, but there is also a timer system where a cycle of skills is activated automatically. Visual elements show where opponents will strike and this can be used to dodge and evade. During fights up to five skills can be used, along with a special, powerful skill called Ultimate.\n\nEach character class has three specializations, but separate weapon and armour specialization paths with their own set of passive and active skills. These are further determined by race and guild alignments and like previous games these can eventually open up new lines such as vampire or werewolf. Leveling up is generally done by completing quests, gaining experience and locating skyshards. A new level is awarded with skills points spent in a skill tree. Different resources and recipes are used to craft items.","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks"},"34405":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"81340fe7-6811-477e-8287-df58c206380b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70c01155-3c6d-4910-92e8-032c4931bc79.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc0c9375-be79-410d-9349-2f04a73505c1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend","Overview":"The most definitive installment of the renouned 2D fighting game franchise, BlazBlue, can finally be taken into your living room.

Since he additionally also received a pick-axe, the path is clearly laid out: exploring the mine and becoming rich! While the game starts with a Wild West atmosphere, later parts of the mine show steampunk elements.\n\nRusty can explore the mine by hacking away dirt with the pick-axe. The goal is to find treasure and additional equipment which is required to be able to proceed in other areas, e.g. a drill allows to break stone. However, those gadgets require water which can be refilled at water reserves which can be found in the mine. Other obstacles are traps, enemies, switch puzzles and platforming sequences. It is also advised to watch for rocks - when Rusty removes dirt under them, gravity comes into play.\n\nThe found precious metals or gems have to be sold on the surface - fortunately there are teleporter and elevators which shorten the way - for money which in turn is used to buy upgrades (e.g. more health points or a bigger capacity for carrying treasure) or equipment (e.g. dynamite for killing enemies, ladders or lanterns). Some upgrades additionally cost energy balls which can be found inside the mine.

Matt brought a Ouija board, but unfortunately it calls Satan and drags the Boss into Hell. Gat and Kinzie follow them to rescue their leader. There they'll meet old acquaintances (e.g. Dane Vogel and Dex) and historical figures (e.g. Shakespeare and Blackbeard).\n\nSaints Row: Gat out of Hell is an add-on sized successor to Saints Row IV. The main difference to the main game is the lack of story missions - the plot progresses by doing enough side missions. When enough chaos is created, a cutscene starts and a new side mission type gets unlocked. After the third cutscene, the player is ready to face the end boss. Other major differences are the city (Hell is new, but smaller in scope than Steelport), the lack of customization (the player either controls Gat or Kinzie) and no licensed music.\n\nCharacter development is identical to Saints Row IV except that new super powers are unlocked by finding and activating altars and flying works a bit different: Kinzie\/Gat don't hover like Superman, but have giant wings. This causes them to slow down over time until they flap. They start with one flap per flight, but this number can be upgraded. While most distractions are known from the predecessor (but re-designed to fit the scenario), a few of them are new, e.g. shutting down factories by fighting over three control points. The four available activities are hellblazing (a flying checkpoint race), torment fraud (a insurance fraud variant), mayhem (causing chaos with a given weapon\/vehicle) and salvation (husks fall from the sky and have to be collected by the flying player before they reach the ground).\n[","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":"2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34530":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9c80822a-a177-4b44-bf95-6c9aef3ca35f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f57eb68b-68c3-44d8-9e8a-05bd3610c18f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f6ee0dfd-25ef-49e9-969a-31563269d4c6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Resident Evil: Origins Collection","Overview":"Experience the early days of the outbreak in Resident Evil Origins Collection, a compilation package of two with two Resident Evil origin stories: Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil HD .

Five teenagers travel there by boat to hang out and spend the weekend. The blue-haired Alex is the main protagonist and she is a good friend of Ren, a talkative stoner. She brings along Jonas, her new stepbrother who does not yet know much about Alex. Joining them is Mona, Ren's crush, and the cynical Clarissa. Clarissa used to date Michael, Alex's brother who passed away, and they do not get along. The island has a few shops for tourists, but only the old Mrs Adler lives there. There are however still many buildings from a long time ago. The game starts as a lazy evening at the beach with a campfire. Ren talks about strange phenomena that occur in a nearby cave and that triggers an event that takes the teenagers to locations all over the island.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person side view with side-scrolling environments. Alex can be moved around freely and a single button is used to climb or jump gaps, but only to continue moving as there are no platform elements. She is the main character and controlled by the player, while the other characters generally follow her. Most of the attention goes to character development, conversations and the relationships between the characters. The game uses a free-flowing conversation system where the characters talk to each other and Alex can intervene, often by choosing from three options. Each option has a different colour that represent a certain emotion. These fade after a short time, so the player chooses one of the options and can also determine when to cut off someone. Remaining silent and not weighing in is also an option. Alex's choices influence how the other characters think about her, how they feel towards each other and what type of options will be available for later conversations. A small text balloon showing a character's face often signals this to the player. Based on the choices, different routes, actions and companions can be chosen, also leading to different endings.\n\nThe game's focus is on progressing the story and there is only a small amount of puzzle elements. These are solved by using Alex's portable radio, which can be activated at any time. By adjusting the frequency she can listen to conversations and music, as well as a tourist guide for interesting locations on the island. There are however also locations with red frequencies. These often trigger supernatural events involving the island's history with horror elements, often including audio and video distortions and glitches. Solving a puzzle is usually done by finding the right frequencies. Another type of puzzle involves finding the correct speed for audio tapes. It is not possible to die or get stuck, but many choices are irreversible. After the initial events the goal is to bring all the teens back together, unravel the island's history and explain the strange occurrences, and find a way off the island.\n\nThere are two types of optional collectibles. Seven photographs can be collected based on triggering certain events and after requiring the advanced radio twelve buried letters can be discovered by tuning the radio to a specific frequency at a specific location. There also several anomalies that can be tracked for additional information, but are not mandatory.\n\nWith the Playstation 4 release a simultaneous update is made with the Xbox One and the PC version. The option to continue the game anew with \"New Game +\" mode is added to the main menu, which will visible after finishing the game. New dialogues, settings, conclusions and earlier feeling of deja-vu will be triggered, throughout the New Game+.","Publisher":"Night School Studio","ReleaseDate":"2016-01-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oxenfree"},"34840":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"LEGO Marvel Vengadores","Region":"Spain"},{"AlternateName":"LEGO Marvel's Avengers"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"TT Games","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"30ab75fd-97ae-4bc5-b6b7-7d849c5deff6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"49955ea5-7dcb-4095-93c5-ce2a3a05cd79.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b4700d95-c50f-499a-acad-967ad9d83554.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"765c0b7e-dc13-4d53-94fc-cf72bf640bc8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"LEGO Marvel Avengers","Overview":"LEGO Marvel Avengers is a spin-off of the successful LEGO Marvel Super Heroes focusing on the story of the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The full game is free to download and play and does not require PlayStation Plus subscription, only a PSN account to download it and play it online.\n\nThe game features over 350 different tanks from five different classes (light tank, medium tank, heavy tank, tank destroyer, and artillery) and seven nations (USA, Germany, UK, USSR, France, Japan, and China) and supports 30-player online mode pitting 15 against 15 players. PlayStation 4 release features new content that was not previously available on PC or Xbox 360\/One releases, some of which include custom maps, custom tanks, and custom vehicle skins.\n\nThe launch for PlayStation 4 platform, however, started with around 130 tanks from only three nations (USA, Germany, and USSR) with the rest being gradually added. Beta exclusive US tanks which can be found in one's Garage include T1E6-PS with elite camouflage and M22 Locust-PS adorned with a color scheme of the original PlayStation console. PlayStation Plus subscribers will additionally get access to an exclusive German premium tank, Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. J PS adorned with a unique darkened camouflage featuring a \"pinup girl\" livery.\n\nLaunch release also features these two time-exclusive multiplayer maps:\nSkorpion Pass - set in North Africa during WWII, at the time of release this is the largest map created for the game\nRuinberg - set in war-torn European town better suited for urban warfare, with fields that allow for outmaneuvering enemy tanks\nThe console version of World of Tanks feels like a completely different game in comparison to PC version. Aside from various aesthetic designs, different settings and presentation, same and different maps, things worth mentioning include:\nConsole version doesn't have separate download releases per regions and during startup player can connect to either US, European, or Asian server. This in turn also means the same Hall of Fame ladder on the Internet features all players independent on the region (while PC one has different for Europe, US, etc.).\nWhen creating Platoon to play with other players on the same team, console version supports up to 5 players in a platoon, while PC only 3 (PC, does however, include an option to create a platoon during actual gameplay by prompting another player to join your platoon).\nPC version allows upgrade of individual tank element (turret, caterpillar, cannon, engine, and radio) while console version has pre-set packages that are researched and purchased which include several of those elements at once and don't offer individual element upgrade.\nWhile PC version relies on keyboard and allows players to type to their platoon, team, or even enemy players, console version relies on a bunch of pre-set messages (some of which are also available on PC version), the chat is available in both version though there are differences.\nConsole version has only 1 crewman per tank, while on PC version that is branched out into driver, loader, gunner, etc., and the number of crew depends on the type of tank. Also, not all crew are compatible with all vehicle types, while on console version vehicle type doesn't matter, only nationality (i.e. German crewman can only be assigned to a German tank).\nAiming at enemy tank on a console version outlines the tank based on where you're aiming at, telling you how big of a chance is for penetration of that area if you land a successful hit, while PC version just generally outlines a tank in green and doesn't show you whether you're bullet will bounce off or if you have a chance to penetrate its armor.\nAiming an artillery on PC just shows a trajectory line, but on console it shows the time that bullet will travel to that place which can be as high as 3-4 seconds on larger distances which plays a huge factor when enemy tank isn't completely static.","Publisher":"IGS Software Publishing"},"34970":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"dbd35901-2253-4495-a15a-585ab8997a4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4e3b1c7-0edf-422d-9927-27e564318645.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"The Crew: Wild Run","Overview":"The Crew: Wild Run is the first expansion pack to the 2014 game.

It was released worldwide in October 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists—a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider—a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including Susan Sarandon, Brad Dourif, Carrie Fisher, Michael Madsen, Lena Headey, and Chloë Grace Moretz provided voice work for the game.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.\n\nDuring its three years in production, several versions of Dishonored were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them. Dishonored '​s music score was produced by composer Daniel Licht to represent London in the nineteenth century.\n\nDishonored received generally positive reviews, focusing on the missions' individual narratives and the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and problems in controlling the player's character. Following its release, the game won several awards, including the 2012 Spike Video Game award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 BAFTA award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one of that year's best games. Following its release, Dishonored was supplemented with additional content focusing on the assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released in August 2015. A sequel, Dishonored 2, was announced in June 2015.","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2015-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hbZI08Wxd-k"},"35014":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"High Voltage Software, Inc.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Sandbox","Images":[{"FileName":"54e082a1-5fc6-43ad-8dfc-6b44b235ad91.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"42300233-0a1f-4d8f-b6e9-538da20e5d73.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Saints Row IV: Re-Elected","Overview":"After the happenings of Saints Row: The Third, the Saints gang extended their reach and the protagonist became the President of the USA. Unfortunately during a press conference, disaster happens: aliens attack the White House, kidnap the Saints and trap each in their personal, indefinitely looping nightmare. Fortunately Kinzie, the group's hacker, rescues the protagonist and together they flee into a space ship with the goal to rescue the rest of the gang. The majority of the game it spent in an open world simulation of Steelport, the location of Saints Row: The Third. There is an extensive character creation which allows to tune every aspect of the protagonist's look and the choice between seven voices (three male, three female and Nolan North).\n\nSaints Row IV continues the course of its predecessor into over-the-top action and humour. The twist of this game is that the protagonist receives super powers within the simulation, e.g. super jump, fast running or telekinesis, which help with moving fast and killing aliens which replace cops as law enforcement. Those powers make driving practically unnecessary, but the player may still hijack and use cars. Third-person fights with melee and ranged weapons still play an important role.\n\nLike all Saints Row games, it features various side activities which can be activated in certain points of the game world. Then the game switches to the mini game and after completing it, the player is rated with either bronze, silver or gold medal depending on the performance. While some of the games are known from the predecessors, e.g. fraud or tank mayhem, the majority are new and are designed around the superpowers. For example, there is a race in which the player needs to solve a running course as fast as possible and another one requires to jump precisely on platforms. While those mini games were an essential part of the main mission line in previous Saints Row games, this time they are only required for the team members' side quests. The main storyline features varied missions which mostly involve moving to a point and killing everything in sight, but also various sequences parodying other genres like side-scrolling brawlers or top-down shooters. Additionally there are other side activities like collecting audio diaries or destroying the aliens' infrastructure points.\n\nWhile the members of the team need to be saved from their nightmares in the simulation, they are physically trapped on the main alien ship. To save them, the protagonist visits the ship a few times during the main storyline without having superpowers available - but sometimes a mech instead. Otherwise, the real world only plays a minor role: the simulation can be exited to walk around the ship and talk to the team members. Besides starting missions, the only purpose is to parody the Mass Effect series and its romances. \n\nProgressing in the game gives rewards: experience points (used to unlock personal upgrades like better damage resistance or more damage with certain weapons) and cache (used to purchase weapons, ammo and weapon upgrades) is rewarded for all actions in the game, but of course finishing missions and activities is most profitable. New super powers are automatically unlocked during the storyline, but they also have upgrades like sliding through the air after a super jump or more damage for blasts. These upgrades require another currency: small glowing balls which are all over the city and need to be collected. Some powers also can be modified in effect, e.g. the blast can be set to fire or ice. The mobile phone is used to requesting unlocked cars and unlocked homie helpers (the main crew receives super powers when finishing their side quests), looking on the map or playing licensed music in the background. \n\nMultiplayer is either playing co-op during the campaign (the second player basically replaces the homie) or starting one of two competitive activities.","Publisher":"Deep Silver","ReleaseDate":"2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"35056":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Climax Group","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ebf34498-1b95-4653-951e-88bdff878e5b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China","Overview":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China is the first game of three in the Chronicles spin-off series based on the main Assassin's Creed franchise. It is a 2.5D platform game similar to the earlier Assassin's Creed II: Discovery. The game is set in China in 1526 with Shao Jun as the protagonist, a character that was earlier introduced in the short film Assassin's Creed: Embers. Set two years after the events of the film, Shao Jun is one of the few remaining Assassins of the Chinese Brotherhood. Her brotherhood was wiped out by Zhang Yong, the leader of a group of eunuchs known as the Tigers, which are in fact Templars controlling the emperor as a puppet. Her new leader Wang Yangming calls her back to China to push back the Templar influence. She brings along the Precursor artifact given to her by Ezio Auditore. At the start of the game she lets herself be captured to infiltrate a former Assassins stronghold now controlled by the Tigers.\n\nThe game has a linear side-scrolling design, but with a lot of vertical movement. At times it is possible to move to a plane in the background and Jun can hide in alcoves or pass unnoticed by hanging from ledges. The game brings over the parkour movement of the main series with jumping, crouching, vaulting, sliding, sprinting, platform sections and more. Although a combat approach is possible, the game encourages the use of stealth. Each level is split up into multiple sections and based on the stealth performance (times seen, times alerted, assassinations and combat kills) one of three Shadow Style ratings is awarded along with a number of points that act as experience to access upgrades such as increased health.\n\nEnemies have a visible awareness cone based on line of sight. Next to white that shows the reach of their sight, there is a yellow state where guards investigate and a red state where they alert others and attack. Jun has a large amount of abilities to wield stealth. She can take cover in alcoves and assassinate from there and assassinate from ledges. Guards spot bodies so these need to be hidden in alcoves or green chests. Enemies can be distracted with a dog whistle, triggering a yellow awareness state and the player can determine the position, reach and strength. There are sometimes dogs that need to be avoided as the barking will draw guards. The game has minor puzzle elements to progress with levers and objects that can be interacted with. In complex situations with multiple guards their patrol paths need to be taken into account. The game brings over the eagle vision feature from the main series where paths become visible through bright colours.\n\nJun can assassinate with a hidden shoe blade, but she can also engage in regular combat with a sword using mechanics to perform two types of attacks, block and roll over. It is also possible to block backwards and dodge bullets. Various gadgets are unlocked gradually, such as daggers to trigger wind chimes or attack from a distance, noise darts, firecrackers that stun, a grappling hook etc. Additional abilities such as dashing between hiding places become available gradually. After each level a number of upgrades can be unlocked. There are also secondary objectives and optional hidden collectibles. Just like the main games it is presented as an Animus simulation so Jun cannot die, but desynchronizes. Also carried over from the main games is the Animus database where descriptions about people and locations are stored as they are encountered. Next to the normal mode a plus and plus hard mode can be unlocked. Existing abilities and upgrades are carried over, but in plus hard for instance Jun has only a single health bar and enemies react faster.","Publisher":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA","ReleaseDate":"2015-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassin's_Creed_Chronicles#China"},"35058":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Climax Group","Images":[{"FileName":"de39071d-fcdc-4ecd-82c9-a535d165e5af.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45abbd39-045e-43f0-8db5-bf897fcb97d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9aabe53c-15e8-422c-97d0-3a01c53916a9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India","Overview":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India is the second game in the Assassin's Creed Chronicles trilogy, a spin-off of based on the main Assassin's Creed franchise. After China as a new setting in the first game, this title takes place in India in 1841 during the time the Sikh Empire was at war with the East India Company. The protagonist is the Assassin Arbaaz Mir who is in love with the princess Pyara Kaur. He has stolen the Koh-I-Noor diamond from the Maharajah's palace and his mentor Hamid believes it is a powerful item. The British troops strengthen their influence in the region, steered by infiltrated Templar agents and they also want the diamond back. Mir not only has to fight the Templars, but also needs to protect his master, the diamond and his lover.\n\nJust like the first game it is a 2.5D side-scrolling platform title that heavily encourages stealth, but does not force it as combat is also often an option. There are sections where small 3D moments come into play, for instance by hanging from windows where guards pass in hallways, paths and ziplines that lead to other layers in the background, and walls and hiding places that can be climbed or used in multiple directions. Combat is done with a sword with various moves to dash, slide, block, dodge bullets, roll and strike with a light or heavy attack. There is only a small amount of health and Mir is quickly overwhelmed. While sneaking enemies can be distracted using noise bombs, smoke bombs, chakrams as a throwing weapon, for instance to slice ropes from a distance, or by whistling. Sneaking is usually done based on line of sight, shown as a cone, but certain sections also have noisy floors where only slow movement is allowed. It is possible to hide in alcoves and steal from enemies if they are not watching. Loot provides additional ammo, keys or documents. Enemies can be choked with a non-lethal takedown and the bodies can be dragged to a different location. Mir can also use a grappling hook to hoist himself up. Tigers and birds play an important role as they can alert many guards at once. Once detected a timer counts down before every guard involved returns from a 'panicked\/alerted' to an 'investigative' state, providing a small amount of time for Mir to find a safe spot.\n\nJust like the first game the player is rated based on how well stealth is applied. The level score combined with style bonuses unlocks perks and new abilities. Optionally chests with items can be opened and Animus shards can be collected. Next to the main game, divided into multiple levels with checkpoints and story sequences in between, there are separate missions in the Challenge Room section, based on three types: Assassinations, Collect and Contracts."},"35062":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Climax Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"d7b04ca0-098b-4004-a63b-89606049d9df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cbdc4e67-4b50-4296-a096-d93005d688a8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4a8b4501-9261-41ee-9e00-7406648e055a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia","Overview":"Russia, 1918.

You begin by choosing one of the Yu-Gi-Oh! shows (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds, Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V) and then following in chronological order of the TV show you begin to duel numerous characters. Each victory against the opponent rewards you with 3 cards from the opposite deck, a deck recipe so you can recreate the opponents deck, and Duel Points (DP). DP are used in the card shop to purchase any one of the 24 booster packs in game. Once you complete any story mission the game allows you to participate in a Reverse Duel where you take control of your opponents deck and battle with it. Completing and winning in all of a characters duel will unlock a challenge deck; allowing you to face that character in a match of better cards and higher difficulty.\n\nBattle Pack mode contains both Draft Play and Sealed Play. In Battle Pack mode, the player begins by purchasing one of the three Battle Packs in game: Epic Dawn, War of the Giants and War of the Giants - Round 2. Then, if playing in Draft Play, the player is given 3 rounds to draft cards in order to create a 40 card deck. Sealed mode will automatically create the deck for you. Afterwards the player takes their newly created deck and uses it online to battle other players. Completing a match with 3 wins (or 3 losses), will give you the option to add those cards into your card trunk.\n\nThe online component of the game allows you to duel against players from around the world. You can play in both Ranked and Unranked matches and each have different rules. Legacy of the Duelist adheres to the banlist of the physical card game. This means that certain cards deemed too powerful have been either completely banned or limited to 1-2 copies during duels by Konami. Playing online with Unranked rules allows you to ignore the banlist and use any cards you want in your deck. Meanwhile playing in Ranked will do the opposite and you prevent you from using the banned cards in gameplay. \n\nThe game also features trophies and achievements, and the paid DLC allows you to purchase a story battle, reverse battle, and obtain special custom recipes not in game.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"http:\/\/yugioh.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Legacy_of_the_Duelist"},"35117":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"id Software","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":"Action; Horror; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fd17eac9-8456-441b-a35c-2f78553ecb52.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"33a3dc2f-69fb-49c3-9f97-3764ecbd85ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1471d5d-d563-46dc-a60e-264ad2c8060b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e5413b59-2ed3-40f1-9d11-f4701f1028c3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bb0e44c1-99f3-41fe-a53d-737223a493d0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a1608197-2211-4e43-ae13-5083eecb65a8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d09a3bd0-3205-4114-b7bb-f7c3019d7d27.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7c2c80ab-c3ee-4dac-ae00-4386874d0e33.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0096e185-dfa5-4f5f-8ec6-7084db386088.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ca067181-6699-4957-b984-599eb8912e76.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8a635ad1-23e8-4e92-aa36-02f859f044ff.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"DOOM (2016)","Overview":"Science has unlocked the gates to the unknown, and now the only thing standing in the way of the forces of Hell is a lone space marine.

Unexpectedly, robots across the United States begin to go haywire and attack anyone and everything, leaving the humanoid Beck and Call as the only bots still functioning properly. Beck is a combat robot and the latest in the Mighty Numbers line, and the only among them able to manipulate Xels, the nanomachines that all robots are comprised of. Thus, he is asked by his creator, Dr. White, to bring the other Mighty Numbers back to their senses and discover the source of the robot affliction.\n\nGameplay is heavily inspired by the Mega Man series, and consists of running and gunning across platform levels while defeating enemies along the way. Beck's basic weapon is fairly weak, but once he has sufficiently damaged an enemy, he can dash into them to instantly defeat them and absorb their Xels. Each enemy has a different type of Xel, which can grant Beck temporary power-ups such as healing or increased defense. After defeating another Mighty Number in a boss battle, Beck may also use their unique Xels to transform and gain new weaponry. Call is also available in co-op play; while she cannot absorb Xels, she falls slower, dashes farther, and has a shield that absorbs projectiles.","Publisher":"Deep Silver"},"35285":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Climax Studios","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"31fc35c3-5453-48b8-85be-e260712c0815.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"707e4e93-3404-4cda-90f4-ce78f1a1d409.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles","Overview":"Assassin's Creed Chronicles is a compilation containing:\nAssassin's Creed Chronicles: China\nAssassin's Creed Chronicles: India\nAssassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia","Publisher":"Ubisoft"},"35288":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ColdWood Interactive","Genres":"Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"06d7d4f1-d921-4388-9d43-c0a6c5df5be7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9a59f952-73be-4a50-8de8-353f3917cb18.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Unravel","Overview":"Unravel is a physics based puzzle side-scrolling platformer about Yarny, a creature made of red yarn. The game opens with an old woman in her house. When she goes upstairs, a ball of red yarn drops from a basket she is carrying and it turns into the creature Yarny. Players control the creature as it explores the house. The game consists of several levels that are accessed through photographs in the house. These represent memories of the house's owners, both good and bad, each with a different environment. Through these, as well as additional sequences, the story is gradually revealed.\n\nYarny needs to travel through levels, solve physics based puzzles and finds ways to progress. The creature is very small, so all everyday objects in the level environments are very large. It is possible to run and jump farther, push objects and hang from ledges. Surfaces that glitter can be climbed. Most of the the mechanics are based around Yarny's body. As it moves the twine it leaves behind, always stuck at the start of the level, is extended and slowly unspools. This twine can be used in various ways, to pull down objects, use abseiling points and tow ropes, swing across passages, throw lassos, tie it to form bridges and trampolines etc. The yarn can also be hooked to any part of the environment marked with a scrap of red thread. There is another difficulty as the unraveling twine is not endless. If it becomes too long Yarny eventually unravels into a single frame. This can be countered by refilling it with balls of red yarn, also acting as checkpoints, or finding a way to solve puzzles using less yarn. It is possible to return and grab the yard tail to collect it and try again.\n\nDuring levels scrapbooking motifs are collected. They are is used to fill photos in an album in the house, until it is complete. Environments include the sea shore, mountains, a rural forest, a cemetery and so on, often with different weather conditions. Each level also has five optional secrets. The game is in 3D, but only uses a single, horizontally-scrolling plane. Objects near the front are sharp, while everything in the back of the environment is slightly blurred and out of focus.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"35290":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Xaviant Games","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"ff9ca9e9-746a-4efd-9fa7-b013e59f9721.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Lichdom: Battlemage","Overview":"Lichdom: Battlemage is a first-person action game with RPG elements where the focus is centered around casting and combining different spells. The player is given control of an mage with infinite power that can cast spells without any need of mana or rest.\n\nThe player can choose between three sigils (spell schools) at any given time. Each sigil has three type of spells: a missile attack, a nova attack and a long range AOE attack. Each attack can be given a different effect which affects the gameplay in a different way. The three effects are: destruction (direct damage), control (various status effects that stagger or distract enemies) and mastery (debuff that increases destruction power).\n\nAlong the three different sigils the player is equipped with a shield that also comes in three flavors: agile (unlimited teleportation, for quick combat), strategic (balanced, with the possibility of blocking attacks) and tactical (focused of blocking attacks). Each shield type offers a reduction in the time to cast a different attack type based on it's specifics.\n\nThe game also features a basic crafting mechanic where the player can combine different spells in order to produce better variants of the base effect. The system features actions like crafting new spells, upgrading existing spells, retrieving components from previous crafts and even a gambling system for those who wish to test their luck.\n\nBased on the player's choice of gender, the story is told in a specific way that revolves around the character's personality. The story remains mostly the same but the roles of the two characters are swapped out. The story is rather generic and revolves around the dragon (the spellcaster) and the gryphon (the scout) who seek revenge after the cult of Malthus killed his wife and took her sister.","Publisher":"Maximum Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"92383":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Zen Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"56e21c34-f47c-4e0f-8dbd-642aeea5a6ed.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"CastleStorm : Definitive Edition","Overview":"Castlestorm features a mix of battle and adventure in it's gameplay.

In the game the player controls a young boy in a monochromatic landscape, solving environmental puzzles while avoiding death in a 3D sidescrolling fashion, thematically and visually similar to Playdead's earlier game Limbo. \n\nThe game starts with a nameless, red-shirted boy sliding down a rocky incline in a forest. While running through the forest, he encounters forest guards wearing masks, who are either inspecting the forest or are intent on chasing and\/or killing the boy. A truck can be seen driving off into the near industrial facility. Escaping a chase from dogs, the boy goes through various environments: a farm where parasitic worms cause pigs to go rampant, a city where lines of people are moved through mind control, a large factory, flooded rooms, a shock-wave atrium and a laboratory environment where scientists are performing underwater experiments on bodies.","Publisher":"Playdead","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=al21DwYUo40","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inside_(video_game)"},"106926":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Playdead","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Horror; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"c00dd7fd-71b5-4266-af01-796481f346b9.png","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"LIMBO","Overview":"Limbo is a 2D sidescroller, incorporating the physics system Box2D to govern environmental objects and the player character. The player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister. The developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. Playdead called the style of play \"trial and death\", and used gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions. \n\nThe game is presented in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo as an example of video games as an art form. Limbo received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length.","Publisher":"Microsoft Game Studios","ReleaseDate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g8yU451wD8o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Limbo_(video_game)"},"114872":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bethesda Game Studios","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"0737f5b8-dd80-4742-9fe4-be94c05ffda4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9f0e7e5d-9611-4fcb-b2ea-322add1a0c12.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18af2d79-8efe-43f9-9041-6da01e8e216b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4b448601-29b9-4a6a-a54d-728aa2b4adf4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2118d7e3-84f8-44e6-92f0-b685cef406bd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4e08a6cc-df5b-4b8b-b01a-b732d555f504.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition","Overview":"Winner of more than 200 Game of the Year Awards, Skyrim Special Edition brings the epic fantasy to life in stunning detail.

Unfortunately, Blake and Lynn get separated in a helicopter crash, and Blake has to find his wife while traveling through a village inhabited by a sect that believes the end of days is upon them.\n\nOutlast 2 is a first-person survival horror game that, like its predecessors Outlast and Outlast: Whistleblower, is a single-player campaign. It is set in the Sonoran desert. The game is also carrying over the found footage characteristics from the first game. The player controls the investigative journalist Blake Langermann, who investigates a dilapidated rural area in Supai, near the Sonoran Desert.\nLangermann is completely unable to fight and can only defend in scripted scenes similar to the original Outlast, and can hide in lockers, crouch, run, jump, walk, vault, slide and climb much like the first game but the player has a much more limited stamina meter and must manage how long they run or else they will become slower and exhausted causing their pursuer to catch up to them. He only possesses a camcorder, which has night vision enabled, though the camcorder's batteries are also drained when night vision is used. Unlike the first game, Langermann's status as a cameraman means he has a much more advanced camera in his possession, one with clearer footage, zoom, and an audio detection system built into each speaker that can be used to detect distant footsteps and other noises but the camera is also equipped with an inventory system displaying the amount of footage they recorded. Spare batteries suitable for the camcorder are spread throughout the locations. Langermann also wears glasses, which limits the player's vision if they fall off.","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

It is the sixth main entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of crossover games. Like previous installments, players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles. Infinite features two-on-two fights, as opposed to the three-on-three format used in its preceding titles. The series' traditional character assists have been removed; instead, the game incorporates a tag-based combo system, which allows players to form continuous combos between their two characters. It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the Infinity Stones, which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected. The game is planned for release in September 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nInfinite was announced during Sony's PlayStation Experience event in December 2016. Capcom initially lost the use of the Marvel license in 2012, after The Walt Disney Company decided to focus on self-publishing its own gaming titles; however, Capcom was able to reacquire the license after Disney scrapped their plans. Infinite was designed to be more accessible than previous Marvel vs. Capcom games, resulting in departures from some series' mainstays, such as assists. The game will also feature a larger emphasis on storytelling, with its own cinematic story experience. The plot follows the heroes and villains of the Marvel and Capcom universes, who must work together to save their merged worlds against a new threat, Ultron Sigma.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2017-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marvel_vs._Capcom:_Infinite"},"129223":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square Enix","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c4ae892f-a3aa-4e14-85cc-ba79b2793ea5.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4b064f50-ecd0-4adb-85ec-0b5b0f630a32.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV","Overview":"A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV is a 2D, side-scrolling brawler set 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy XV.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in April 2015, being co-published by Klei Entertainment, for the PlayStation 4 and Vita in February 2016, and for iOS, as Crypt of the NecroDancer Pocket Edition, in June 2016.","Publisher":"Klei Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer"},"129243":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Daybreak Game Company","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"70f4dff7-b7b4-46f8-b872-03fc8ef172b7.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97177cd5-6c49-40c9-8677-4fa77d5f18d5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ac751b0c-0b63-48a8-9aaf-3ab9cac6f340.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0da1e672-03e0-47fb-9038-5141595e474c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6e7792a4-118f-4317-904f-ef0618acdac2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"10eb3705-533d-4ecc-90ac-748fb01d48a6.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"98f8366a-f7b0-4a2b-b61b-1f1addd2703e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0ee610a5-c3d9-4c96-875d-ec786de14abb.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0c98e52d-7e35-47ef-8dff-07a41336f76a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"69f2c5da-1106-4137-abe5-3f13e250213a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"DC Universe Online","Overview":"DC Universe Online (abbreviated DCUO) is a free-to-play action combat massive multiplayer online game set in the DC Universe of DC Comics.

Can crimes ever be forgotten? Hiding behind the mask of the average man on the street, and furtively blending into the background, many war criminals, ex-Mafia members and other criminals have been literally getting away with murder, or worse. That is, until you turned up to ruin the party.\n\nAs part of a secret and mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it’s your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way, using your unpredictability to your advantage.\n\nTrack the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one.

The story is primarily based on the 2015 movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but also includes additional content that introduces a storyline bridging the events of Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. That way players get to relive the experiences from The Force Awakens, but also play with a new plot between the final events of the original trilogy and the sequels. As with all TT LEGO adaptations there is also a large amount of humour.\n\nThe Gameplay is similar to previous LEGO Star Wars games where players interact in a LEGO-themed Star Wars universe filled with action, platforming, and puzzle-solving. Over 200 playable characters are available in this game, including Rey, Kylo Ren, Finn, Captain Phasma, Poe Dameron, BB-8, and many more. Each player has their unique abilities for completing the various puzzles you will encounter throughout the campaign, including new ways to incorporate droids and Jedis into these challenges. For example, some droids will manipulate the hardware for moving platforms to allow the other player to advance.\n\nThe levels also alter in theme, from areas relying heavily on the game's platform, puzzle-solving mechanics to large spaceship battles to cover-based shootouts during combat against stormtroopers. The hub world is a galaxy in which each planet is its own world with the chapters, as well as additional missions, some of which add to the storyline of the Star Wars universe, bridging the events between the original trilogy and the sequels, as previously mentioned.","Publisher":"WB Games","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lego_Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens"},"132659":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"EA Canada","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ac12c477-1215-4053-9f25-556f60bb9915.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"514e108e-c8e8-4ea6-8667-21b13dc1e762.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"NHL 17","Overview":"NHL 17 is the 26th edition in the Electronic Arts' long-running ice-hockey series.

While players are free to approach these challenges however they wish, a typical day might look like this: \n\nYou wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then it’s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop. Some slimes are totally not vegetarian, after all. \n\nNext, you’re off to feed slimes their breakfast over at the slime corrals so they don’t get too out of hand during the day. Hungry slimes get jumpy. Jumpy slimes can’t be contained. \n\nWith your ranch set for the day, it’s time to begin exploring the untamed wilds of the Far, Far Range. Along the way, you’ll encounter slimes you’ve never seen before, discover a new type of veggie to cultivate back at the ranch, and narrowly avoid certain doom in a valley of burly, feral slimes. \n\nWith the sun setting, it’s time to head back to the ranch, rustle up some dinner for your slimes, and try and figure out just how the heck you’ll keep these new slimes that seem to, well, explode all the time. \n\nBut you can do this. You had the courage to travel a thousand light years away from home to make a living as a slime rancher. Slimes that go boom? No problem. Slimes that burn with a radioactive aura? Bring it on.

Alien races from the Milky Way galaxy, including Humans, Asari, Krogan, Salarians, and Turians, dispatched several arks toward the Andromeda galaxy after discovering several suitable planets for new colonies using deep space scans based on Geth technology.\n\nAfter modeling your protagonist, male or female, and setting some very basic info in regard to the original trilogy, basically just setting whether Commander Shepard was a male or female, you start the game by being awoken from a 600 year cryosleep. Due to malfunction, your twin sibling (brother or sister, opposite of your character selected sex preference) didn't wake up and ended up in a comma.\n\nThe arks have reached the Andromeda galaxy and it is time to visit those promised new worlds. However, it turns out that none of them is habitable as the climates changed in the last 600 years, some naturally, and some due to terraforming by an AI-like race of machines known as Remnant. Their technology is far beyond anyone else's, but their goal is unknown and other races you meet in the Andromeda galaxy all seem eager to unravel the mystery behind Remnant technology. Things didn't go as anticipated upon your arrival to Andromeda galaxy, and your father, the Pathfinder on your vessel, is tasked to find out new worlds that could be colonized. But after giving his life to save yours, you end up being the next Pathfinder and hope for mankind.\n\nFollowing the plan to regroup at Nexus station, which is basically a smaller version of Citadel from previous Mass Effect games, you find out that none of the other arks were heard of and that Nexus is in dire need of food and supplies - which initiated riot and fight among militia and other personnel. Not many are eager to put faith in you, being new and unrefined Pathfinder, but you are assigned a spaceship called Tempest, and a crew to help you search and explore uncharted new worlds.\n\nSimilar to previous games in the series, in between missions your crew may have new things to talk to you about, and you can try and pursue a romantic relationship with some of your crew. You can upgrade your character's skills, you can trade weapons and items at various merchants in Nexus, and travel between planets.\n\nMining is not done in a typical way, and you only send a probe when you have an alert of possible minerals in the area or some stranded ship or some other phenomenon. Moving between planets and asteroids is done completely in 1st-person perspective (not free movement, but navigating pre-set paths) and can be skipped.\n\nResearch and development is also supported, but this time you have technologies from different galaxies that can be researched and developed. Weapons also support mod slots which vary from having bigger ammo clip capacity to doing more damage or having better stability. Armor works in a similar way to before, and also support removal of your helmet during cut-scenes, assuming you're not in a hazardous area which requires a helmet. While on board the Tempest, you have your personal outfit which can support full color radius change, though you can only change your own outfit while in your captain's room, and not the outfit of your crew.\n\nWhile your armor has the ability to act as a semi-jet-pack, in order to explore the planet in full you will also be given a rover, similar to that in the original Mass Effect game, which has the ability to jump, boost speed, or make itself more capable of traversing steep terrains. It can also have different paint jobs if you don't like the default white one.\n\nThe rover also gives you additional protection from the planet's hazards such as radiation or extreme cold. But this time, exploring planets isn't just for gathering resources and materials, but also for building colonies on a suitable places. You can select what type of colony you wish to build, whether it should be military outpost or a scientific colony, but make sure you don't leave your colonists unprotected against the Kett, a new hostile alien race you will first encounter in the Andromeda galaxy.\n\nAside from weapons, the Pathfinder has a scanning tool which helps you scan objects and people and it also interacts with SAM, an AI that is part of every Pathfinder, and can help give you necessary information almost instantly.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2017-03-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zPx_ZhYPppY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda"},"137905":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Puuba","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"dbb575d8-8433-405a-a2bc-01fdc5b0cb5e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"95f27856-e7cb-4fcf-b6b8-d09191740f95.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Metronomicon: Slay The Dance Floor","Overview":"Packing in a fully-fledged story mode with a colourful cast of musically-empowered heroes and villains, The Metronomicon sees you take control of a party of eight newly graduated masters of the “rhythmic combat arts” to wage musical warfare against a multitude of dance-mongering fiends.

The game features Ethan as the entirely new protagonist not seen in any of the previous Resident Evil titles. He arrives to a farm house in rural part of Louisiana in search of his missing wife, Mia. His wife disappeared several years ago without a trace, and his only clue was a video file of her he has on computer telling him that if he ever sees that message, that he should stay the hell away from here and forget about her. What man could just give up on his wife so easily... Ethan definitely isn't the one to accept the current situation and has come looking for her wife and doesn't plan to return without her... or the truth behind her disappearance.\n\nWhile the game progressively introduces more weapons and increases level of action as the story progresses, it starts with protagonist in a fairly helpless situation seeing how main foes cannot be killed so easily, and when they are killed, they don't stay dead for long. Ethan will find himself running for his life or trying to hide in order to save the bullets for when he may really need them. The inventory size is limited and can be increased by collecting additional backpacks, and items cannot be dropped anywhere to be collected later. Instead, there are various item boxes around the map, mostly in save rooms near the tape recorders which are used to save game progress, where player can store and retrieve items (the boxes are all \"magically\" connected, so stored item in one box can be retrieved from another). There are four weapon slots for quick change, while the rest of the slots are just for holding items. Healing items have their own configured button which uses healing items in order of lower healing property (if you have small and big healing potions, small one will be used first). The game is not paused while using inventory, and it doing so in a dangerous area, enemy can attack you while you're in the middle of it.\n\nEthan arrives at a farm in Louisiana on a trail of his wife, and before too long he finds clues that his wife was or still is in the vicinity. But she does not seem to be herself anymore which she painfully demonstrates on him. Whatever she and the family that still lives on the farm are now, Ethan is still mere mortal who can feel severed limbs or being stabbed. However, the liquid substance used for healing seems to solve that problem for him if used in time. The game was built for VR from the get going so it can be played entirely in VR mode or regular 2D mode on a TV or monitor. The VR mode sacrifices resolution for level of realism and uses headset for aiming (your character automatically aims at the point you are looking at). In VR mode, character's hands are also shown a bit more than just seeing fists holding a weapon which additionally adds to a level of realism. Going back to the origins of Resident Evil games, rooms were connected by doors which serve as loading screen animation between rooms, not showing you what is in the other room. This game does the same (apart from loading) in a way that when you open some door, you don't see through it but picture starts to appear after you pass through, so one may never know who or what awaits behind the door.\n\nRE7 is as much horror as it is survival, boosting up scare elements and minimizing downright shooting action which offers normal and hard difficulty, while unlocking nightmare difficulty level upon completing the game. For the big part of the first half it seems more like a game from Silent Hill franchise, but as you move toward the ending it all starts to make sense and Resident Evil franchise starts to become apparent again, leaving any questions (i.e. what happened to Zoe, how does Chris Redfield play into all this, where did Lucas go, etc.) to be answered in story-based DLCs. The game uses auto-save feature, but also supports manual saves in save rooms at the audio recorders. There is no need for save-game material like using ink ribbon to save at typewriter in earlier RE titles. Japanese release of the game has some gore tuned down heavily and has been released as regular (gore-less) and grotesque version. However, even grotesque version release is not fully uncensored and still has some key elements removed or tuned down in comparison to US or European releases.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2017-01-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MI_lUf6ixc8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Resident_Evil_7:_Biohazard"},"142906":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Respawn Entertainment","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b438b2e1-58bc-4e6d-bc7c-44915e557527.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3d2beae6-b32e-40fc-9570-73c499071122.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Titanfall 2","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Titanfall_2"},"142907":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"inXile Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"9cb098b7-2073-4716-8742-19ecddf55185.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Torment: Tides of Numenera","Overview":"You are born falling from orbit, a new mind in a body once occupied by the Changing God, a being who has cheated death for millennia.

It is set during September 2021, one year after the events of Dead Rising 3 and sixteen years after the original Dead Rising. The protagonist is Frank West, formerly a freelance photographer and now a professor at a community college, returning as the lead from some of the earlier titles. The prologue is a nightmare in the Willamette Park View mall in Colorado from his earlier days during the zombie outbreak. When he wakes up he receives a message from his his rebellious protege Vick Chu who drives him to Willamette. West thinks they go there to play minigolf, but Chu actually wants to look into a secret military base with him where human trials are supposed to take place. After sneaking into the base which serves as a tutorial, soon the scenes from his nightmare become reality again, set in winter during the Christmas period.\n\nAs before the game focuses on brawls against large groups of zombies, using combinations of melee and ranged attacks along with thrown weapons to mow down zombies in spectacular ways with over-the-top and slapstick violence. The game again uses an extensive crafting system where players can create and customize their own weapons along with building many types of vehicles. Weapons include for instance the Gandelf, combining a spear and a garden elf to shoot exploding elves and a slam attack. West gets to explore Willamette which has changed a lot since his last visit. The mall from the original Dead Rising has been turned into the central Willamette Memorial Megaplex. At the same time he also gets to explore the surrounding neighbourhoods. As usual there are a lot of items to discover and collect such as weapon blueprints and hidden graffiti art to photograph. There are also many side quests, hidden bosses known as Maniacs and additional investigations to pursue along with events to rescue survivors or destroy military equipment. There is more time to explore as the game no longer employs a countdown timer to urge the character forward. Shelters serve as safe havens to acquire new vehicles, weapons and maps that reveal collectibles in the environment. Experience provides skill points used to upgrade abilities.\n\nPhotography plays a role now, as West can use a camera during investigations with different filters for night vision, to detect clues or to take selfies, similar to the Batman: Arkham games. Another new element is the introduction of an Exo Suit. It briefly makes West extremely powerful, allowing him to tear through the environment and the groups of enemies. Some opponents can use it too. Enemies no longer get powerful at night during the day-night cycle, but there are new enemy types such as the soldiers from the Obscuris organization and the suicidal \"freshies\", humans that have only just turned into zombies. The game's save system is now more traditional based on checkpoints, rather than a limited amount of saves.\n\nThe game still supports cooperative multiplayer, but now no longer for the main campaign.

Of course, the space station will defend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, with their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to be destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find out about their agent's hidden ties...\n\nWEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No need to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body.\n\nUPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are.\n\nITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls.\n\nGEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.\n\nSECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special.\n\nMAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss.\n\nSTORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English.\n\nGAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die.\n\nSKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way.\n\nAnd the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just have to discover the rest on your own.","Publisher":"Francisco Téllez de Meneses","ReleaseDate":"2018-07-11T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ghost_1.0"},"153498":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dan Smith Studios","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d493f164-0893-43b4-93c1-1bec876c88bf.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"The Spectrum Retreat","Overview":"The Spectrum Retreat is a challenging, first-person puzzle game set in the near future.

It is the third installment in the Diablo franchise, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in May 2012, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013, and for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2014. In the game, players choose one of seven character classes – Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, Witch Doctor, or Wizard – and are tasked with defeating the Lord of Terror, Diablo.\n\nAn expansion pack, titled Reaper of Souls, was released for the PC versions of the game in March 2014, and was later released for consoles as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version in August 2014. The Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer pack was released for the Windows, macOS, and latest-generation console editions of the game in June 2017.

Snow and ice have shaped a merciless landscape. Nature is corrupted. Monstrous creatures out of an Eldritch horror dream roam the frozen wasteland.\n\nAs the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, you must navigate a vast territory, in which you will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive.\n\nIn order to survive and overcome all challenges, you need to attract followers, bringing them into your refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without followers, you can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting only makeshift tools and weapons. \n\nFade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well you read weather patterns, and if you come to the right conclusion: either to look for shelter or to press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.\n\nFeatures:\nTense atmosphere and unforgiving gameplay.

Lead a ragtag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new criminal power to see how long you can hold out when you're constantly short on supplies and a single shot can cost a cop their life.\n\nYou’re not exactly the police, but you're the only ones on the side of justice\nViktor Zuev, a sadistic crime boss new on the scene, has quickly taken the town of Ripton by the throat. The community's leaders and local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which he now controls as his own private fiefdom. An outlaw band of renegade cops refuses to bow, however. With little hope of success, they fight on — for justice, and the soul of their town.\n\nGunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key\nYou're fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover, approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm. You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment, as well as special tactical perks which you can unlock as you upgrade your rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes, don't hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone is shot, they'll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means instant death.\n\nExplore, scavenge, and watch your back\nRebel Cops features not only compact operations where you need to fight for every inch of ground, but also large, open locations to explore — the sandbox levels. Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get into inaccessible areas — and, above all, grab everything that looks useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan-out, and try to explore every corner.\n\nTake the high road, or the low road\nZuev's mercilessness is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules? Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive, but remember: reputation is more valuable than money. Bad blood on the streets can easily put your good name in the mud. Merchants will refuse to do business with you, and even some of your own people might turn their backs on you.","Publisher":"THQ Nordic","ReleaseDate":"2019-09-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"169385":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"6 Eyes Studio","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"9c3a96a3-9792-4962-bb24-049e2b6d81d2.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43021408-2a40-425d-8034-6049dda53984.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Fell Seal: Arbiters Mark","Overview":"Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark is a story-driven, turn-based tactical RPG set in a fantasy world with a touch of steampunk.

It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\n\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...\n\n...who will you become in the process?\n\nMAKE THE LAW\nSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\n\nWEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES\nSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\n\nDEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\n\nEXPLORE THE FROSTLAND\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\n\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\nIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\n\nGO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN\nThe main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future.","Publisher":"11 bit studios","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frostpunk"},"169685":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fairy Forest","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"e455c8c9-2f23-4b37-befe-3f8812105ca1.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"The Tower of Beatrice","Overview":"The life of a thief isn’t easy: always hiding in shadows, clients cheat, traps bite…\n\nWorking on a contract for a mysterious client, you'll need to infiltrate the tower of the powerful sorcerer Beatrice, steal her Book of Recipes, and get out alive.\n\nAlong the way you will enter a demon's dreams to discover his most intimate desires, accept a gift from a Granny-spider, start the Clock Tower, feed a snail, make a tea for a demon, piece together a skeleton, and finally fix your own fatal failing.\n\nFeatures:\n- Six floors – each with its own atmosphere and mood\n\n- Surprising and charming residents – demons of Fire, Frost and Dream, Iron Maiden, Hungry Chest, and many others\n\n- Alchemy!

Produced in commemoration of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise's twenty-fifth anniversary, it was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in November 2017. The story sees Sonic the Hedgehog joining a resistance force to stop Doctor Eggman. It features three gameplay modes: \"Classic\", side-scrolling gameplay similar to the original Sega Genesis Sonic games; \"Modern\", 3D gameplay similar to Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors; and a mode featuring the \"Avatar\", the player's custom character.\n\nThe game was primarily developed by staff who had worked on Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations, using an updated version of the Hedgehog Engine, used in Sonic Unleashed and Generations. Development began after the release of Sonic Lost World in 2013. The game was intended to have a darker tone compared to previous entries in the franchise, and the character creation system was inspired by Sonic fan art the developers had come across over the years. It was announced at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con under the working title of Project Sonic 2017.\n\nSonic Forces received mixed reviews from critics. They praised its presentation, character creation system, and Modern Sonic gameplay, but criticized the level design and noted technical problems. Many critics felt that the game lacked ambition, and called it a disappointment in the wake of the positively received Sonic Mania, released earlier that year.\n\nThis game was released in November 7, 2017 for the world, except in Japan ( released two days later in November 9, 2017 )","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2019-11-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/-eEs5pTgtNc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sonic_Forces"},"172349":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Blue Games","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6b3a236d-6d81-4e84-ac47-06bc27805613.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Sparklite","Overview":"Sparklite is an action-adventure set in the whimsical and ever-changing land of Geodia.

It is a real-time tactics video game with an emphasis on stealth. The player commands a squad of up to five characters and must infiltrate heavily guarded enemy compounds. Each enemy guard has a cone of vision which the player characters must evade. If a guard spots a corpse or one of the player characters, he will raise the alarm, and additional soldiers will spawn from nearby buildings and begin patrolling the area. Thus a reckless approach will only make the player's task more difficult. The crux of the gameplay involves studying the patrol routes of the guards and their cones of vision, isolating a single guard by distracting his comrades, then killing said guard silently and swiftly hiding the body. The player can in this way pick off enemies one by one as he works his way to the objective.\n\nThe environments in this game are more detailed and interactive than the environments of the Commandos games. Some objects such as vases and icicles can be dropped from a great height to either create a distracting noise or kill an enemy beneath (or both). Bushes can be used for concealment and to dispose of bodies. In night missions, the enemies' cones of vision are weakened, but standing in bright light makes you especially noticeable against the darkness. Whereas the Commandos games had mostly 2D environments, the environments in this game are rendered in a fully-3D, which means the camera can be rotated freely.","Publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2017-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shadow_Tactics:_Blades_of_the_Shogun"},"172860":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"SGWC","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CI Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"64c0c1ee-0207-41a6-a80b-dd4fb0c3a8aa.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts","Overview":"Experience pure sniping gameplay across the harsh terrain of Siberia in a brand new contracts-based system, encouraging strategic thinking within engaging, redeployable missions.\n\nFulfill contracts that offer clear objectives with a fixed monetary reward and options to complete bonus challenges for payouts.

King Leonidas I of Sparta and his army of 300 stop the advance of an invading Persian army that counts tens of thousands soldiers. In the end, he falls, but not before costing the Persians so dearly that their conquest for Greece fails on the very shore they landed. Two generations later, Alexios and Kassandra were born. Depending on player's selection, one of them plays the protagonist while the other becomes an antagonist. But before they were shaped into mighty warriors, they were children, they were Spartan, and one of them was to be sacrificed to the gods at the behest of the Cult of Kosmos who works in the shadows yet controls the world through chaos. Many years later, the remaining sibling lives on the island of Kephallonia, while the other is presumed dead by being thrown from the mountain in the sacrificial process. The protagonist living in Kephallonia was rescued and raised by Markos, a shady character with a knack of making drachmae and getting himself into trouble, but with a good heart. Being raised by such a person made the protagonist took a path of becoming a mercenary. Feeling ready, it was time to venture into the world and find the answer to many questions that troubled the protagonist from the childhood. Why did their father allow the sacrifice? Is the mother still alive? Who or what is the Cult of Kosmos and what are their plans? Thus, Alexios' or Kassandra's odyssey begins.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is the the first time in the series where the player gets to choose the protagonist. In Syndicate player could switch between sibling protagonists, but here the entire story is shaped around the single selectable protagonist, Alexios or Kassandra. The game also has two main gameplay modes... one which helps the player by showing where to go next for main quests, and the exploration mode which forces the players to explore Ancient Greece on their own and find out where the next goal is on their own. Similar to previous games in the series, the player can move on foot, ride a horse, or commandeer a ship (or a smaller fishing boats that will break on open sea on big waves). Many RPG elements were taken directly from Origins so the player has various weapons and armor which can be replaced or upgraded by the blacksmith. Weapons and armors can also be engraved with special abilities. As with other RPGs, there is a leveling up system in this game, but the enemy levels up together with the player so while the player's attack, defense and overall strength increases, the same happens to the enemies so player never becomes strong enough to more easily or more quickly take out some fortress or a pack of wolves head on. Weapons and armor too have a level number assigned, but each piece of equipment can be upgraded to player's current level with enough money and resources. Money is earned by doing mercenary jobs, weather story quests or various tasks which constantly appear on the bulletin boards in towns and ports. Experience points are earned by defeating enemies, solving quests and opening new regions and areas on the map. Experience points are used to level up which in turn lets the player exchange skill points to upgrade existing or unlock new skills. After a while, additional upgrade system opens which lets the player use skill points to upgrade warrior, ranger, or assassin type of attacks. Spent skill points can be reset at any time and re-used for entirely new selection. While the player is a mercenary and he gets paid for various jobs and bounties, doing bad things in the open may create a bounty on player's head which will make other mercenaries hunt the player. Bounty can be lifted by remaining out of sight for a while, by paying money for your crimes, or by killing those that put bounty on your head. The quests are split into odyssey quests which are quests tied to the main story, add-on quests which are related to DLCs, world & characters which are quests given by characters you met on your travel, and bounties & contracts which are acquired from various bulletin boards. By completing the main story quests, the game doesn't pause or asks the player if they wish to continue exploring, it simply continues as if they were regular quests. End credits roll doesn't kick in, though credits can be accessed via main menu. A photo mode is available and lets the player post a photo online which appears on the part of the map where it was taken. The same way, player can look at other cool photos taken and posted by other players. Entirely new in this game and further step toward role-playing game are selectable dialogues and topics to talk about. Even choices which can be used in dialogues without having to unlock such ability like in other RPGs, for example choosing the approach to get some answer... through intimidation or seduction. There are also many romances (although none really deeper than one-night stand) which can be followed through based on dialogue selection and actions done in a specific quest. But even though sex element is introduced, nothing more than flirting dialogues that lead to a kiss which then fades into black screen is shown.\n\nLand Combat & Controls:\n\nWhile Ancient Greece has many island and is surrounded by sea, most of exploration will still be done on land. While on foot, the player can walk, run or sneak while crouching. Sneaking reduces the chance to be spotted, and if the player is in the bushes then unless the enemy soldier bumps into you, the player is invisible which is indicated by slightly highlighting the player character. There are many different weapons the player can wield, from swords and hammers to spears and tridents, each weapon has its own pros and cons, power and speed. Only two weapon types can be selected at the same time for a quick switch during combat. Close combat weapons are warrior weapons. For long ranged attacks the player uses bow and arrow. There are different types of arrows and different skill moves and powers can be assigned for both warrior and ranger style attacks. Assassin skills and assassin attacks are used only when the enemy is unaware of the player, meaning when you sneak up to or run to the enemy looking in the opposite direction. There is literally no limit to where the player can climb and after reaching certain level, jumping from skies won't harm you either. World map is initially covered and it shows various locations, towns, fortresses, bandit camps, and other points of interest by entering new region. Synchronization points are still there and once reached they can be used for fast-travel, otherwise the horse really speeds up the travel as opposed to running, although in vicinity of towns even the horse won't be fully galloping. To upgrade equipment or craft arrows and other things, resources are needed. They vary from tree branches to metal ore and are scattered around the land, re-spawning upon entering the same area, and same happens to cleared forts and soldier camps.\n\nSea Combat & Controls:\n\nThere are small fishing boats which are fast and useful for reaching close islands or navigating across the shallow water with no big waves, and then there is the main ship, the Adrestia, that players can upgrade and uses to battle enemy ships and travel the open sea. The ship can be upgraded in appearance (both ship itself and the crew) as well as in strength. When fighting other vessels, archers fire at longer distance while javelins fire at closer. Additionally, ramming an enemy ship from the side causes massive damage and can sometime break the enemy ship in half. When damaged enough, the enemy ship can also be boarded and plundered. Most of weapons and armor can be sold and disassembled for parts, but epic equipment cannot. If it clutters the menu with many old epic pieces of armor or weapons, those can be stored in a chest on the player's ship. Bulletin board with contracts and bounties can also be accessed on the ship. But sea combat and exploration isn't limited to surface alone... the player can dive the entire sea and explore the underwater life just as well. While underwater, holding your breath leaves a short amount of time to dive leisurely, but there is a trident weapon which when equipped gives the player the ability to breathe underwater so exploring underwater ruins and fighting sharks can be done without having to worry about the remaining air in your lungs.\n\nAir Combat & Controls:\n\nThere isn't really any type of combat that takes place in the air, but there is a controllable character that is non-stop in the air, namely Ikaros, the player's faithful eagle. While in the open, the player can switch to Ikaros at any time and check the surrounding from high up in the air. Ikaros can tag enemy for the player which is the main purpose of this bird, although it can soar on its own and explore more distant areas. Synchronizing map points also adds a brief cutscene showing Ikaros circling around the checkpoint and giving the open view of the area. By level up the player character, as well as synchronizing more checkpoints, Ikaros too gains new abilities such as being able to see and mark targets further, come down and swoop nearby animals or even be called on to distract enemies.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s_SJZSAtLBA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassin%27s_Creed_Odyssey"},"172953":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Brain Seal Ltd","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"f14f3dc5-47e9-46a9-8a84-af30816667d6.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Story Of A Gladiator","Overview":"Story of a Gladiator is an arena beat 'em up where you take the role of a man who is in search of his destiny, only to find it in the sands of the colosseum.\n\nYou are a common man who has lost everything in the wars with the roman empire.

It features a cooperative multiplayer mode, in which the player can be joined by up to three other players to complete missions.\n\nA large portion of the gameplay consists of the player exploring the world which is mostly covered by \"The Dust\", a mysterious toxic cloud that obstructs vision, disables the in-game map, and requires the player to monitor their oxygen level. Players venture out to gather resources such as food and crafting materials as well as to activate the various portal generators scattered throughout the map. These generators serve as the games fast-travel system and are each unlocked by completing a tower-defense segment. Metal Gear Survive tasks players with managing thirst and hunger by scavenging for water and hunting animals for food. Players can then return to base camp in order to cook food and later purify water for safe drinking. There is also an injury system, which requires players to use different medical supplies to heal ailments such as bleeding or food poisoning.\n\nThe main enemies of Survive are crystalline zombie-like creatures called \"Wanderers\", with many variants introduced as the story progresses. The enemies in Survive can be overcome using either stealth or a large variety of weapons and gadgets earned gradually through finding crafting recipes or broken weapons. Players begin with access to melee weapons such as spears, machetes and shock-batons. Eventually bows with several kinds of arrows and firearms such as pistols, shotguns and sniper rifles are acquired. Due to the difficulty of attacking enemies head-on, players are encouraged to use a device that allows them to erect various fences, barricades and other structures. Available gadgets include grenades, Molotov cocktails, decoys, automated gun-turrets and a plethora of traps. Killing enemies earns players \"Kuban Energy\", the game's currency which can be used to level-up and acquire new skills. After completing the main story, four additional \"sub-classes\" are unlocked which have their own set of skills gained by leveling up. Class skills range from straight stat bonuses, special attacks, mobility skills and even stealth camouflage.\n\nPlayers are able to upgrade their base camp by building defenses, advanced crafting stations, farms, animal cages and rainwater collectors. Other survivors can be rescued from The Dust to provide base camp with support staff. Base staff can also be organized into an exploration team and sent out to automatically acquire resources. Eventually, players can initiate a tower defense segment at base camp, allowing them to defend against attacks and earn rewards. Players are able to purchase \"Survive Coins\" which can be used to unlock various features such as a resource booster, base defender, emotes, additional exploration teams and additional load-out slots beyond the initial four. Players can unlock character slots which act as the game's New Game Plus mode. Survive Coins can be earned as in-game rewards and login bonuses as well.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2018-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X3hjRKGrC40","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Survive"},"174266":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Darksiders III","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gunfire Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f564c81d-a56d-4287-8268-9986c4fe0349.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e01b05a1-6e40-4a75-9a41-4f943a5da9a6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Darksiders 3","Overview":"Return to an apocalyptic Earth in Darksiders III, a hack-n-slash Action Adventure where players assume the role of FURY in her quest to hunt down and dispose of the Seven Deadly Sins.

Alongside the returning Fatalities and Brutalities, new gameplay features are introduced, such as Fatal Blows and Krushing Blows. Fatal Blows are special moves similar to the X-ray moves in Mortal Kombat X. Like X-ray moves, Fatal Blows deal a large amount of damage, but unlike them, they only become available when a player's health drops below 30%, and can only be performed once per match. Krushing Blows are a special cinematic variation of a given special move, triggered when certain requirements are met, like most Brutalities in the previous game. Also new to the series is a Flawless Block mechanic, which allows for a comeback window after blocking an attack with precise timing. Another returning finisher is Mercy, last seen in Mortal Kombat 3, where the winning player can opt to revive their opponent, giving them a small amount of life.\n\nMortal Kombat 11 also introduces a Custom Variation feature which offers a character customization system similar to the Gear system in Netherrealm Studios' previous DC Comics fighting game, Injustice 2, improving over the Variation system featured in Mortal Kombat X. Each character has an initial set of outfits, weapons and moves, which can be further customized by the player. However, unlike Injustice 2, in Mortal Kombat 11 the characters' appearance does not determine their abilities, allowing the players to create custom move lists independently of their character's appearance.","Publisher":"Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2019-04-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=G4My4kc-Lbo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_11"},"174580":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"fb74eabc-264b-470c-9d7e-26708baa9d69.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b826ba6-9cb4-4b64-b7ac-b35410db2105.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"c661bc49-f80d-4550-b1c2-709288d02273.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":3,"Name":"Devil May Cry 5","Overview":"evil May Cry 5[a] is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed and published by Capcom.

Those same pixels can then be used to blast through environment puzzles and enemies, devolving Pip back to a single pixel. Players will explore five stylized worlds and experience up to 10 hours of epic adventure saving Pip’s village from the evil Queen DeRezzia.\n\nInspired by classic platformers, Adventures of Pip basks in a world where players can defeat a huge 32-bit boss as a single pixel or even as an 8-bit character.\n\nWith three different forms, evolve and devolve Pip to solve puzzles and defeat enemies; each with their own weakness and strength that must be unraveled throughout the campaign.","Publisher":"Tic Toc Games","ReleaseDate":"2015-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"174630":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"46aa39c3-8096-4e3d-a412-ca51e845c647.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dedace49-c21a-4e04-ae09-5b7b1f32cfb4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Assassin's Creed III Remastered","Overview":"FIGHT FOR FREEDOM\n1775.

It consists of several dream-like environments and in each of them the goal is to reach a tree to move on to the next level. Controls always consist of movement, jumping and crouching, but each environment has different mechanics. There are sometimes ways to interact and also different gravity levels. Many of the levels encourage exploration, there is a lot of platform jumping and a large amount of environment based puzzles to solve.\n\nAfter a short introduction for the tree, the first main level is a cramped series of hallways in an old house. There is a maze-like structure with rotating rooms and trap doors. The second environment consists of white rocks floating in the sky, connected through bridges. There are moving platforms and fires are used to alter the environment, creating bridges to progress. There third environment is a road at night, with trucks coming up in front or from behind, crashing into obstacles at the end in an endless cycle. The character needs to avoid the trucks driving at a high speed. The next environment is similar to the second one, but with a different setting. There are no fires in this one, but platforms that disappear when the character stands on them for too long and there are also platforms moving vertically. In the next level the character is suddenly huge, in a city-environment with skyscrapers.

In several small levels the player controls a ninja who has ten seconds to kill all robots. The background story is different. There is no Robot Hitler like in the original game, but now a pirate captain called Greatbeard who has captured all the animals the ninja protects and has turned them into robots. This, along with some other references, is a nod to Doctor Robotnik from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.\n\nWhile ten seconds is the minimum amount of time, players are encouraged to complete levels much quicker. This is to compete against other players on worldwide leaderboards, but also to earn up to three stars needed to unlock new sets of levels. The basic controls remain identical. The ninja can move left or right, (double) jump, attack with a sword and throw up to three shuriken per level. Greatbeard's zeppelin acts as a hub where different sets of levels can be accessed. The game has about 100 levels including the 40 levels of the original 10 Second Ninja remastered for this edition. Levels often have obstacles such as spikes and are meant to be played many times in succession to try different strategies and get faster times.","Publisher":"Curve Digital Publishing Limited","ReleaseDate":"2016-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"176814":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"101 Ways to Die"},"176815":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"11-11: Memories Retold"},"176816":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":140},"176817":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"2064: Read Only Memories"},"176827":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"Q"},"176880":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5941bcfb-ce22-463f-b842-1cb9372f272b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"160cffc7-e3de-4597-9f37-64b02f09c604.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Ōkami HD","Overview":"Set in classical Japan, Ōkami combines Japanese mythology and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf.

The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, BFG 9000, and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" energy sword and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a grappling hook, useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WZ8EmUkh0Y4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doom_Eternal"},"177437":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Slightly Mad Studios","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"1a766e5f-3e26-47da-91f6-8a9ee05e19e5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Project CARS 2","Overview":"Project CARS 2 is the thrill of intense racing action in beautiful cars at stunning venues.

Controlling one of 15 characters from the series' cast, players compete in races using sports cars. They view gameplay from a third-person perspective while performing tricks, drifting, and collecting power-ups. Team Sonic Racing differs from traditional kart racers because of its focus on cooperative gameplay, similar to the kind featured in Splatoon (2015) and Overwatch (2016)—players are part of a team of racers and win races through efficiency rather than speed. Game modes include competing to earn points, time trials, customizing the racing rules, and a story-driven tutorial campaign. \nSumo Digital, which had previously worked on Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012), developed Team Sonic Racing. Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka conceived the cooperative gameplay, and Sumo Digital used the team-based Sonic Heroes (2003) as a point of reference. Unlike Sumo Digital's previous racing games, Team Sonic Racing only features Sonic characters, as the team wanted to expand the series' world and character roster. They aimed to make the game stand out compared to other racing games and developed it using a modified version of the All-Stars game engine. Musician Jun Senoue, who had not contributed to a major Sonic game since Generations (2011), composed the soundtrack. \nTeam Sonic Racing's existence came to light when a Sumo Digital memo leaked in January 2018, with Sega confirming it the following May. Its marketing campaign included appearances at trade shows, a one-shot comic from IDW Publishing, and a two-part animated series. The game was released on May 21, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. A simplified version for iOS developed by Hardlight, Sonic Racing, was released on September 19, 2019 via Apple Arcade. Team Sonic Racing received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the team-based gameplay, track designs and music, but criticized the story mode and voice acting. Critics also considered it inferior to the Sega-All Stars games.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Team_Sonic_Racing"},"177900":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"8-bit Adventure Anthology: Volume I"},"177915":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"2urvive"},"177916":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"It's Anecdotal","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8bb57d5a-9305-407e-bd91-becc35feae0c.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01e49136-6139-446c-a4d4-2ea292ef642b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8c93e5d8-4c20-4259-8385-b09bb1d65779.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"39 Days to Mars","Overview":"39 Days to Mars is a co-operative (and single-player) steampunk puzzle-adventure game.\n\nStep into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars.\n\nWhen the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park.

The Charred council suspects that the demon king Lucifer is planning something with Samael to upset the balance and orders War and Strife to investigate. After invading Samael's keep, they find it under attack from another master of hell, albeit a lesser one, Moloch. Samael informs them that he is not in league with Lucifer and the current attack on him is the result of that. Before he can say anything else, Moloch attacks and Samael teleports the horsemen to the void to find and talk to his associate. The horsemen track through the void and finds Vulgrim to be the associate Samael spoke of. Vulgrim informs them he can help track down Lucifer but he needs several artifacts. After collecting those required artifacts Vulgrim informs them that Lucifer has paid a visit to Mammon, a hell's master. Samael comes to void and suggests that the horsemen find Mammon and make him talk about Lucifer. They find Mammon with several relics and weapons from Eden. After killing him, the horsemen come back to Vulgrim and Samael where they learn that Lucifer has opened a path to Eden and bringing the sacred water and turning it to poison. The demon Belial is in charge of this operation. After stopping the operation, they confront Belial but spares him. But after the horsemen leave, Lucifer comes and kills him. The horsemen learn that Dagon, the drowned king is also being helped by Lucifer to cleanse Eden as Lucifer has offered him Eden. Meanwhile, they meat Abaddon, the guardian angel of Eden. He informs them that Lucifer is spreading corruption and asks them to help him cleanse the corruption from Eden. Afterwards the horsemen track down and kills Dagon. They return to the void and Lucifer advises them to destroy the source of Moloch’s power before they attack him. They do so and together with Samael, they attack and kill Moloch. However, before his death, Moloch tells them that Lucifer’s plan is complete and Samael knows about it. After returning to the void, Samael tells the horsemen that the Lucifer asked for the souls of the masters of hell after their death in exchange for their services. Samael also tells them that Lilith is also plotting with Lucifer and together they have made an artifact called the “Animus” which is fueled by the souls of the masters of the hell. This artifact is used on earth to corrupt the mankind. The horsemen go to earth to find the mankind living in sin and realize that they have helped Lucifer achieve his goal. Lucifer talks to them through a human child and tells the horsemen that corruption of the humankind is spreading and it will continue. After they come back to the Charred council as the council declares that humankind needs to be watched as a third kingdom. They then forge the seven seals as a treaty to uphold the balance between heaven and hell. Three of them comes from the demons and three comes from the angels and one is from the council. They declare whoever breaks the treaty shall suffer the wrath of The Horsemen, setting the stage for the future games.","Publisher":"THQ Nordic","ReleaseDate":"2020-02-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M_BkKeHoTi0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Darksiders_Genesis"},"180725":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"101-in-1 Megamix"},"180898":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalanche Studios","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b2a30262-8ad8-40ea-9885-c9f72225c4b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rage 2","Overview":"Rage 2 is a first-person shooter.

The in-game map features diverse geography, including mountainous areas and open fields. Unlike Need for Speed Payback, the game does not include a 24-hour day-night cycle, but players can switch between day and night. During the day, players can take part in sanctioned race events, which reward players with cash to spend on new cars and upgrades. They can also take part in illegal street races at night, which would earn players REP. The more REP player earns, the more aggressive the police will be during the night. Players must escape the cops and get back to their safehouse, before they are busted, or their car is wrecked. When players return to a safehouse, the REP they have earned during the night will be multiplied by their \"Heat Level\". If players are arrested, they will lose their REP multiplier, but will still receive their unmultiplied REP. The REP multiplier mechanic works similarly to the Speed Points multiplier from Rivals. The game also features a storyline in which the players interact with the city’s police force, led by authority figure Lt. Frank Mercer. Players can smash neon flamingos hidden within the map, which rewards them with a small amount of money or rep depending on the time of day. They can also find graffiti, referred to as \"Street Art\" in the game, and send it to the livery editor to use it on their car(s). Lastly, they can complete activities around the open world such as smashing billboards, beating scores on drift zones, getting the highest speeds passing through speed traps, and going the longest distances when performing long jumps. Players may complete \"Crew Time Trials\" which allows them to complete short timed events in an attempt to get the #1 spot on the leaderboard in their crew.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2019-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZmxK1CvwyN8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Need_for_Speed_Heat"},"183351":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Civilization VI","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Firaxis Games","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"ea94ae70-01ee-445a-b0ca-58ac8aaa3ee8.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4af3abec-6527-4223-a857-6394901f2235.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Sid Meier's Civilization VI","Publisher":"2K Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2019,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/g.co\/kgs\/Bm2vNY"},"184127":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Digital Eclipse Software","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"feff8132-d460-46fd-9a8a-8ea5c959baa6.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf6ed551-d238-49a2-873d-a52820d4a357.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Disney Classic Games: Aladdin and The Lion King","Overview":"Disney Classic Games: Aladdin and The Lion King is a compilation video game for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PCs, featuring Virgin Interactive's video game adaptations of Aladdin and The Lion King.

A new progression system is introduced to World of Chel, which allows players to earn a rank in each of the four sub-modes separately. There are six ranks players can reach; Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Elite.

The last few weeks of each season allows for clubs to participate in the Club Finals Championships, playing for a cup that corresponds to which division they are in; for example, a team in the highest division would play for the Elite Cup. Winners of cups are able to hang championship banners in their home arena and don championship patches on their jersey.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X4QPDt8sXQI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NHL_21"},"194315":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Eidos Montreal","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"13d39801-cd09-4718-b9d1-21da8b100122.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Marvel's Avengers","Overview":"Marvel's Avengers is a 2020 action role-playing brawler video game co-developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix.

At the beginning of the game, players can customise the gender, voice and the appearances of Fenyx using Aphrodite’s Beauty Chair.

The player character is accompanied by a companion bird named Phosphor, which can identify locations of interest in the map. Fenyx can traverse the world quickly through climbing cliffs, riding on a mount, and flying using the wings of Daedalus. The full open world will be accessible from the start of the game. As players explore the world, they would encounter rifts which would teleport them to the Vaults of Tartaros, which are a series of platforming challenges that require players to utilize both Fenyx's combat and traversal abilities. Players can also complete various side-objectives and optional puzzles.\n\nThe world of the Golden Isles are occupied with various enemies inspired by Greek mythology, including minotaurs to cyclopes. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks with a sword are fast but weak, and heavy attacks with a hammer are slow but strong. Fenyx can also use bows and arrows to defeat enemies. Players need to manage Fenyx's stamina during combat, as they will become exhausted when they attack successively. As players progress in the game, they would be able to unlock powerful godlike abilities. For instance, Fenyx can unlock Ares' spears which thrust enemies into the air. Armor and weapons can also be upgraded by collecting sufficient crafting resources in the game's world.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2020-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vvr2Ff-7Y5E","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Immortals_Fenyx_Rising"},"196983":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Black Forest Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0d81cba1-9a59-4246-aace-6d5bc7c51357.jpg","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Destroy All Humans!","Overview":"The cult-classic returns!

It also has permadeath. A gameplay session offers different arena-like rooms where a large amount of enemies need to be destroyed. A single door leads to a new room and after a large opponent an elevator is used to move to a new part of the tower. At the start of the game the player chooses a weapon and a perk. There are ten weapons and eleven perks in total. To unlock all of them certain conditions need to be met. Each weapon has a different effectiveness complemented with a perk such as faster character speed, more armor, a triple jump, no falling damage, permanent loot, no self damage etc. Destroyed enemies leave behind red orbs that restore health, coins and blue items that fill up a weapon experience meter. Each time a new weapon level is reached (up to five), the main gun becomes more powerful. When the character gets hurt not only health is lost, but the weapon level can be lowered as well. Other random gameplay elements are badges that permanently alter characteristics similar to the starting perks, such as faster speed, more chance for critical strikes, gun modifications or additional double jumps (up to such a large amount it is almost like flying). There are also items of which only one can be carried. These offer additional bonuses, special attacks or a giant jump. Coins can be used at vending machines to unlock an item or badge on display. Levels and enemies often have an industrial look and the game has a humorous touch visible in the text during the game, visual elements, giant bouncing projectiles and extreme gun modifications such as a rocket launcher that acts as a shotgun. The gameplay is twitch based and requires constant movement, dodging and quick reflexes. It also supports air control for character movement, bunny hopping, circle strafing, gaining movement speed through slopes, jelly-like cubes that provide boost, and double jumps that can be performed multiple times in succession. Next to the variation in enemy and level design, the different rooms contain secrets on hard to reach places, usually by walking through walls or dropping down floors. When stuck in a part of the level without the ability to jump out of it, a key can be held to respawn at the start of the room.","Publisher":"SOEDESCO Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TPWBhXl-KrE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tower_of_Guns"},"201002":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Villa Gorilla","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"4ab993cb-89ca-4ecf-bdf9-bec1221722aa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Yoku's Island Express","Overview":"Yoku has arrived on Mokumana and he’s ready for the easy life, soaking up the sun and delivering parcels on a tropical paradise!
