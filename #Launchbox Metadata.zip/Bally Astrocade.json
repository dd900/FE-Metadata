The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.\n\nWhen the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.\n\nThe game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.","Publisher":"Astrocade, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mIuXQE893m4"},"104370":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Action Graphics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"c83d7f05-b57f-438c-b4f2-139e3d77e82d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"188e12f9-db3b-4054-acc2-d3262c5537f7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b1f4db2d-9d0b-484b-ac29-99e2fc3f7c5a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"5d24ace2-09fc-4b21-b933-3c8c8cfa1065.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"510e5f6c-62bb-4a1e-a14e-c1019513dbe1.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1e68b6f3-3a9e-46d9-9143-4fd810d27c4d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"daf2fc6d-5107-4f84-afa1-16ced146a318.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d84597fb-74b3-44aa-8787-f1d55d8fbeda.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"25b4b061-35bb-4c22-b4c9-372cf8d4207a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Cosmic Raiders","Overview":"Cosmic Raiders is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up similar to Defender.

In every level four bombs are dropped along with a number of fighters to ensure the bombs reach the surface of the planet. The objective of the game is simply to clear all the enemies and get the highest score possible. For every two bombs destroyed an energy star that the player can collect will appear. By picking it up the player's ship is energized with an invincible energy shield. Once all enemies have been cleared from one level the game moves on to the next.\n\nBefore starting out it's possible to choose the number of players (1-4), number of lives (1-9) and the intensity of the game (0-9).

The action takes place on a single screen and the player starts out in a small boat at the top of the screen. At the bottom there are several pieces of treasure that has to be retrieved (one at a time) but the ocean is also full of fishes and other sea creatures that have to be avoided. Any contact with these (including the smallest of fishes) will lead to an immediate loss of life. A life is also lost if the player runs out of oxygen which means it's necessary to plan ahead since it's not possible to go back to the boat (and recharge the oxygen) empty handed. With the press of a button the player can move quicker but at a higher cost of oxygen. After clearing all treasure from the cove the game will move on to a new location with more valuable treasure but also with more fishes.\n\nThe game can be played by one to four players in hot seat. Before starting out the number of lives for each player can be chosen from one to nine. There is also a tournament level mode where each player has four divers. This mode was meant for players who wanted to mail their high score to the developer for high score verification.","Publisher":"Esoterica, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5tsNDhM3Tp4"},"104596":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Midway","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"24a0ddbd-5475-4fff-a773-053a893279f9.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ad614dd5-deee-4f59-a698-4b4c5b0eba61.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d94945af-5cd7-46ee-87b0-363b5da39069.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"67e6f087-e61e-43f5-8bce-ad74ce4447a9.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4b38188b-bce0-4597-a904-56df16f3642c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a5c922d6-61dc-4025-ba10-562679ced68e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4bcdda27-309e-4417-9bc9-00133d595d9b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"96b410eb-f92e-4a74-bdf7-b8ac515f053d.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6860144d-a671-48ab-9fe7-316ee2906027.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Space Fortress","Overview":"Released on the Arcades as Space Zap and for the Bally Astrocade as Space Fortress.\n\nThis is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player is in control of a stationary laser base which is located in the middle of the screen.

The X-Wing is controlled by player one while the Tie Fighter is controlled by player two or the computer. Before starting out a maximum score (1-999) is entered and the player that first reaches it wins the game. A single hit is enough to bring down the enemy ship and it is worth one point.\n\nThe game is viewed from a third-person perspective with a pseudo 3D representation of the trench. The colour of the trench changes constantly to illustrate the forward motion of the fighters. By moving the joystick up or down the fighters accelerate or decelerate which means they move to the top of the screen and decreases in size or move to the bottom and get larger. If one moves closer to the camera the other gets further away and vice versa.","Publisher":"Astrovision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1979-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/exY1ZAlQmeU"},"105588":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Perkins Engineering","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"88475184-cf4c-4e23-9d24-b404f6f6538c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2faa2ee5-ba08-493d-b199-6f72fa47bb63.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e17a45bd-5824-4b46-9e21-dd338838deaa.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8aaa431-1af1-43d3-aab6-49dc8fd5a181.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9cb0d26e-4f4d-43ce-8635-751501d9a4ef.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e75aa62b-080a-4805-8dfc-a195af0b126c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"611e5fc7-277a-4764-a86a-64d4ab7e5a21.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8adcd06f-78ac-48b5-9a37-c95537b5681b.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"67bb9ab5-2150-4754-834f-30946b68653d.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"166b9e7c-4f70-4254-94e1-deac95cf5170.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Artillery Duel","Overview":"In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player.

There are three different tracks that are all one screen in size. The controls simply involve accelerating and steering left and right with the aim of reaching the finish line first. The number of laps (1-99) and the difficulty level (pro or beginner) can be selected before a race. Pro differs in the speed of the cars.\n\nDemolition Derby is similar to Grand Prix but here the objective is to ram into the other cars until only one remains in the arena. Each car has a number of points (which is chosen by the players) and for each hit one point is lost.

Final work was completed in 1985 with the engineering of the tape interface circuit boards.","Publisher":"Astrocade, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CZ_nlTlqisM"},"126528":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bally Manufacturing Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"39b88418-54c7-42c0-a39a-2f74392beb4a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c20471ea-02c9-449a-9b7e-b5e80c4a6e30.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ba9bad7c-7df1-4fbd-800c-4f30c7ce778f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"8cce6ddb-e6de-4ad5-9141-fe04f79c3d98.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"cfe48252-a275-4dcc-af9d-6616b19ab2cf.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"69d50630-d6e7-40fa-bb19-967ad2462795.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"37ffa5af-6a10-475a-a6c3-9d0055d7786c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"581c67ac-36e0-4573-9713-5b9071f52c75.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8553f761-dc4e-4e6d-8dbc-0618b82fb7e6.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"caa133b1-d19a-4732-b070-6f0f7dc9aeb3.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Letter Match + Spell'n Score + Crosswords","Overview":"Three different games will improve your vocabulary and reinforce spelling skills.

The game was so popular that it actually caused coin shortages in Japan! The unprecedented success of the arcade game made it an ideal killer app for the Atari 2600 in 1978, and it only makes sense that Bally would want a version of their own. An unlicensed version of Space Invaders was released on Bally’s console in 1979, but the game was quickly renamed Astro Battle. It was a blatant clone regardless of what the title screen said. The entire game consists of shooting down alien spaceships and periodically seeking cover behind large barns. Astro Battle on the Astrocade doesn’t feature quite as many gameplay modes as Space Invaders on the 2600, but it does a great job of capturing the spirit of the arcade game it was based on. The aliens are alive with color, the game is fast, and controls are responsive. The biggest downside is how abruptly the game ends. After finishing off the sixth wave of fighters, the game ends suddenly and immediately resets to the menu screen. This is annoying if you want to play the game for more than a few minutes at a time. Astro Battle didn’t exactly make the same splash as Space Invaders did on the Atari 2600, but no console from the era would have been complete without their own take on the classic arcade game."},"175124":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Riff Raff Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"33143e74-ad38-4c68-9597-7fa87e2ff817.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e26f0a63-f99d-4b85-9898-c4a5da08c5c1.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f0a3f043-534a-4806-92d4-e0224a756257.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d5e3b6be-7cf3-4b38-bca1-e4ad6b44d4ad.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a4f5dcb5-ac47-49a8-bb67-5c88239d2cdb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"6ddb0799-05c6-45a9-9f48-a430eee3a37a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"8f5969b8-e31a-4d27-897c-a8a399c40558.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d9e94fee-86bc-4a89-a129-e6574da16909.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crazy Climber","Overview":"Crazy Climber for the Bally Astrocade which is a homebrew game with a limited release in 2011 by Bally Alley.

You'd better move fast, because the higher you climb and the more buildings you face, the quicker the pace becomes.\n\nThe original 2-joystick control scheme has been implemented as well as a single-controller mode.","Publisher":"Riff Raff Games","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2011,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/jjp6T7ouAmI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crazy_Climber"}}
