Most notably all graphics in the game are generated in real-time by the SG-1000 rather than streamed from a LaserDisc, which in turn leads to more predictable car physics. The concept of racing in four different types of GP is scrapped, replaced instead with a GP that spans the world and three selectable difficulties.\n\nLike the original, the game uses a third person perspective (although the camera is positioned behind the steering wheel), and sees the player race in a formula one car, navigating the course and avoiding other drivers. This version is also notable for having a simplistic track editor.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS94N73u7wM","Platform":"Sega SG-1000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"c53cef93-5798-4cc1-b5c2-3b4d6544fad1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"100e51c9-e4bf-44a2-892c-720ad3bd53f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"50957cb9-0dc2-4376-adc7-2bd2ad2e8fff.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"6dcf2200-1b25-4114-9cb8-ff827bf0254b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"be6eb623-afe1-4a1c-b313-1fca1819a309.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"451435a1-b6e4-4628-97fb-d80e55374902.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"7580d2a3-3c7c-4641-b602-0365525bea5a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"f35d27ad-e050-4194-a646-9d2a75627307.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":35146,"FileName":"b07643c5-7b7e-491b-9f77-efdccc76b7cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":35146,"AlternateName":"瘋狂大賽車","Region":"Asia"}]},{"DatabaseID":35130,"Name":"Gulkave","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Gulkave is an SG-1000 shoot 'em up game developed by Compile and published by Sega in 1986.

Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.\n\nThe SG-1000 version of the game is one of two SG-1000 releases to see four separate Japanese releases (the other being Monaco GP) - three on cartridge with each of the SG-1000's box designs, and one on Sega Card. Despite this it did not see a release outside of Japan.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxmhwT__X2M","Platform":"Sega SG-1000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"f4bcca6c-0f01-4e01-9848-3c34d372c557.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"89ebf69d-2aa3-43d1-a081-b55cb69c9ab3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"f7f29dd1-2f5e-42a9-8f75-54c7c7d2cc48.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"32d4e892-5e4b-4cc4-9b48-6e6b3a6dd6da.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"18dcdce6-c63d-4d13-b4ca-f3959cf28d59.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"a1c2a3f9-a14e-45f2-905e-2dd45c78e0ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"b499a33b-457d-48a9-90bf-33aacd757c60.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"1879bfb5-b490-4ecc-b708-4cbfae52831a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"f02f925e-f4c8-44ad-b33c-96590a919ed5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"066b49e2-8489-4629-baef-f683cf7611ce.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"3d0e1d76-e40e-4527-948d-8bd87f798820.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"9d0577dc-536f-4f06-9074-3c3f541c6c7c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"4cd4aa28-97df-4f69-96b0-90784aa49817.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"3b4db9cf-57c9-40b0-a8f9-702a625c9e60.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"35a75ecc-9fcf-4670-8568-be84e84f63bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"58168e81-a8ae-48f0-b36a-dcd0918e26f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"ac178a64-32b8-4f26-ba85-03a191d5dbec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"39b7dcc1-7cf3-421a-b7c2-da190bae1f8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"FileName":"f8b20b9a-6982-48d7-8f09-e6fc05decc10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":107788,"AlternateName":"摩托車遊美國","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":107788,"AlternateName":"MotoRace USA","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":107789,"Name":"Zoom 909","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Zoom 909 is an arcade game developed by Sega for VCO Object arcade hardware. It was released worldwide in 1982, however after obtaining a license for Buck Rogers, western versions of the game became known as Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Both Zoom 909 and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom are largely the same game minus some minor graphical differences.\n\nThough most home ports of the game are based on Planet of Zoom, Zoom 909 was brought to the Japanese MSX in 1983 and SG-1000 in 1985. These versions take more liberties with the formula, introducing a top-down stage as level 3.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytw2fzx9kv8","Platform":"Sega SG-1000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"1c431c87-cfe0-4e56-a0e7-0130f50efe4d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"ddf5cbcd-61a6-4bc7-9a65-dd6f3dc845b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"7a4563fe-9748-43c2-a5a8-30af4d6a8e54.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"5442ca5e-0d2e-465a-b17e-c0f6abb6682c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"bd438994-b477-419c-82bb-a089480004bf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"4e216f98-3ce4-4260-939f-165af6de3eb4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"9f5e6d2b-1a05-4c5f-8c7f-e95b58ed4775.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"6aaec2d7-cd72-4418-973d-b9bea861ef3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":107789,"FileName":"f4c9bfe2-f334-4cc5-839f-00949c113606.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":107789,"AlternateName":"火狐狸","Region":"Asia"}]}]}
