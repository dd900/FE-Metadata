These include stones, barriers, animals such as dogs and turtles, etc., and can be avoided by destroying or jumping over them. The protagonist runs automatically, but the player can increase or decrease the distance between him and the running girl. In order to make the girl choose the wrong way and fail to find her house, the protagonist throws stones at her (these can also be used to kill animals and destroy obstacles). After the protagonist has caught the girl, the game switches into sex simulation. The player pushes arrow keys in a specific order to correspond with the protagonist's movements. The goal is to sexually satisfy the girl. If the player fails, the protagonist is arrested; if he succeeds, the girl marries the protagonist.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Macadamia","Publisher":"dB-Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196865,"FileName":"0acf029d-5fab-4ff3-aa31-5a0a6f6ce35e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196865,"FileName":"b8cb65f8-4fc6-4271-a10c-ff2d8f9fef74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":159771,"Name":"1942","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"1942 is a vertically scrolling shooter for one or two players.

Outside of the apartment complex you can score points by eating the mice that run across the clotheslines. Once you've jumped through a window you enter a room where you play a randomly assigned mini game.\n\nThese mini games include: eating all the fish in a fish bowl, stealing milk from a bunch of bulldogs, pushing a birdcage from a table and eating the bird, catching mice inside a big cheese, pushing vases from a cabinet. To make things harder there's always a broom inside every room that tries to knock you around. You score points by completing the mini games within a certain time (the faster the better).\n\nAfter you've completed a mini game you're back in the alley. Make your way back inside the apartment complex and you get a chance to play the love-cat game: try to reach the lady cat on the top row of hearts while rival male cats and cupid's arrows knock you down.

After equipping your team with all the necessary supplies (don't forget the mosquito netting!) you travel to your base camp at the edge of the jungle where you will begin your journey.\n\nYou will quickly meet up with many of the hazards of the jungle as you explore, including hostile natives (hope your Guard is a good shot!), mosquitoes, disease, covered pits, wildlife, and more. Each of your team members has an \"EL\" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more effective at avoiding hazards. You also get an Efficiency Rating \"ER\" which is an overall score of your exploration completed and loot collected minus your money spent and the number of team members killed.\n\nOnce you have mapped a few sectors of jungle you will find some ruins with passages leading underground. Underground is a lot more hazardous than the jungle, as many of the pitfalls you encounter mean instant death if you don't have the proper equipment or your team was not alert. The natives are also a lot more numerous underground as well. But don't worry, you can always replace members of your expedition.

The battles are presented in a separate mode, where the player directs troops using commands.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":187820,"FileName":"309c2e4b-3f52-4ff7-aa4f-a9f3efa3a9b2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187820,"FileName":"b99c4091-c7da-4da8-8856-3fa78b0ea9e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187820,"FileName":"78d79cf1-a688-4458-b4b5-13465d7246a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187820,"FileName":"2d19ee19-6deb-43a6-afda-3d8a05dc1224.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187820,"FileName":"c29ed61b-659e-496c-b95c-c64919940212.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187820,"FileName":"746f430c-99b2-4b84-b72b-35cbfe4eda66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187821,"Name":"Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika: Genghis Khan","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika: Genghis Khan is a top-down 2D turn-based grand strategy game, based on the real mongol leader Genghis Khan's life.\n\nThe game's main objective is to become the supreme ruler.

Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSP3TH9pmqw","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Strategy; Board Game","Developer":"Free Fall Associates","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187824,"FileName":"cd4db477-bb06-49ea-9926-313a908e15a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187824,"FileName":"8d820996-bff2-411e-b6ca-284a090b11bd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187824,"FileName":"7010008b-b9b4-4189-9491-db217f85611f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187824,"FileName":"229ab3b9-ea1b-4c93-9b28-4b91d0d4d4f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":187824,"AlternateName":"Archon","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187825,"Name":"Arctic","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as \"active rail playing\".

In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186800,"FileName":"94badcc2-82a0-4900-8808-60825c95d4db.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186800,"FileName":"4f56e33d-8f6c-498a-872d-e6215b97b895.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186800,"FileName":"bc1760ff-e4df-46ab-87b6-80e4a8b2b7d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186800,"FileName":"bfd9a0aa-dc1b-4f89-918d-39e1fc1f31a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186800,"FileName":"d29f96e3-30d7-4d38-9e05-e20d06d02197.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186800,"AlternateName":"Taiyō no Shinden","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":187831,"Name":"Attack!!

Only Ayumi can stop the evil warlock Baram and his monster minions, since the inhabitants of the other world consider her a goddess incarnate.\n\nAyumi is an adventure game with comical and slight erotic undertones. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting commands (such as Examine, Ask, Take etc.) from a menu. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, navigation is done in a RPG-like fashion on a top-down world map, with individual locations represented as icons. The game allows a considerable degree of exploration, though some areas are inaccessible until certain conditions are met. As opposed to most Japanese adventures, the story progresses by solving problems (which usually involves procuring items and using them in another context) rather then simply by triggering events. There are also a few puzzles in the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Game Technopolis","Publisher":"Game Technopolis","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187832,"FileName":"bf7debae-8920-4ed7-bd83-506dbdb81a33.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187832,"FileName":"3e3771d1-d8ab-477a-8cf7-80b9c8e0db46.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187832,"FileName":"51743fa1-ade5-4123-918f-7430bb34f00f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187832,"FileName":"2fe1e85f-a3fb-4ec0-bbef-5250d7bceed9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187832,"FileName":"19e4e507-46bb-4be2-9aee-909f0db982c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187832,"FileName":"befb30e3-2894-4bb9-a757-8e3854c07395.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":187833,"Name":"Aztec","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Aztec is an Indiana Jones-type action game with adventure elements, featuring our hero's quest to recover a valuable Jade Idol from a maze. Armed with only three sticks of dynamite and a pistol, the hero must get by traps, animals (lots of snakes and panthers), and natives, and find a way to make it out alive.\n\nThe value of the Idol is set on the level of difficulty and declines as the game progresses. Thus, the player is awarded with the speed of which a successful recovery can be made. Multiple commands allow for freedom of movement, and expand the adventuring side of the game. The animation used several frames for each creature.\n\nAlthough the game is somewhat easy on the lower levels of difficulty, the game appears impossible on the highest of the 8 skill levels. The creatures in the maze increase in number and speed, and tend to want to follow you around more. This is difficult however if you want to go to the lower level and there's a hungry jaguar waiting for you.\n\nYou walk around exploring boxes and \"trash piles\". Sometimes a box contains something useful such as a machete, pistol, bullets, dynamite, a health potion, or the idol. Sometimes it contains skulls or bones, or even nothing at all.\n\nThe game features some unusual traps. You can walk into a room and the walls start moving in on you, or the ceiling starts dropping on your head. When you die, you have the option of restarting using the maze you just died in. That way, all of your exploring is not wasted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Datamost, Inc.","Publisher":"Comptiq","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"4a63b612-e600-4ff2-ba8e-883407133f49.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"5c40fe3f-84e3-46d3-9620-e04a9b9dd799.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"95b0411e-b0f3-490c-a30d-b7c553d2aec7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"96cce480-8d02-4d7c-8ce4-8bd4c39b92a8.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"7bbf0669-5753-4d41-b2a9-4cb32e8167c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"d424b3cf-e56c-4ffa-973e-3a7d2c522fbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187833,"FileName":"2980b7a2-1c95-46ae-a7ff-e9a464f8a1e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181104,"Name":"Babylon","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"The country of Babylon was once a thriving community, enjoying peace and prosperity.

Only one brave adventurer traveled to Babylon in an attempt to destroy the evil that dominated it.\n\nBabylon is a side-view action game with light platforming and role-playing elements. The game takes place across interconnected screens, often arranged in maze-like patterns, with vertical shafts that required climbing, dropping down, or jumping over chasms. The jump key is also used for attacking, which requires gaining momentum and repeatedly \"bumping\" into the enemy. There are no experience points or any type of currency, but defeating enemies may yield healing potions or better weapons and armor. These items can also be found in the numerous treasure rooms found in the game. The player is given considerable freedom as to which area to explore first, but many areas are initially blocked, requiring the player to procure a key or return with better equipment in order to defeat a stronger enemy guarding the location.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWZ59U_1bwY","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform; Role-Playing","Developer":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181104,"FileName":"ab599755-044e-48c7-953f-59cb3e5c541f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181104,"FileName":"c32a72c0-b7a9-41d0-95d3-cf2148b8c42f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181104,"FileName":"44f30147-1e23-463e-bd22-567253e8a41b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181104,"FileName":"ef848a8e-b9ba-4ef2-95e2-14b68a23a3e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180981,"Name":"Back to the Future Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"This video game incarnation of the movie Back to the Future (1985) is a Japanese-style adventure game with visual novel elements.

But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188152,"FileName":"2a984091-c331-49fb-84cb-328ac2cf11c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188152,"FileName":"d377df67-f902-4b06-8a80-d7a2d44e324a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188152,"FileName":"5ee465bc-a748-48f4-aa67-671e7e4f5c42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188152,"FileName":"6f50a427-5f9e-40f7-b40b-34f2cf3fdffa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188152,"FileName":"e48cce07-8941-44a0-b34e-5cbbc3583e83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188156,"Name":"Bomb Jack","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one.

The player has to interview suspects, unlock new locations (which, in their turn, deliver new suspects), as well as gather and examine evidence in order to advance the story and solve the case.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Enix Corporation","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1989-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":177853,"FileName":"6fe16d6e-7d2e-4d45-b536-217a026a178a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177853,"FileName":"2f2b02bd-1a01-49a1-92a5-929c6b22b246.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177853,"FileName":"566c5b36-d2fb-403a-a8ab-0cd254e56aa2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177853,"FileName":"936473b3-72c5-4daa-9bec-0982777029bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200760,"Name":"Byakuya Monogatari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"College student Hiroyuki Sato came to a hot spring resort and was shocked by western type mansion known as witch's house and decided to sneak in.\n\nThis is a horror game with some comedy elements.

Perseus starts the game on a raft off the coast of the island, which is crawling with monsters which randomly move about. These can be fought by running into them while holding down the fight button.

Energy is decreased though by being hit by enemies and also slowly decreases with time. Perseus starts with 1000 energy, which can be supplemented by finding energy sources scattered around the island. Once the energy reaches zero, the game is over. The game can also be lost if Perseus's raft is capsized by one of the giant crabs that infest the surrounding seas.

There are numerous ways for the protagonist to die, such as being shot, stabbed, strangled, bitten by a dog, eaten by a shark, falling from the second floor.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Bothtec","Publisher":"Bothtec","ReleaseDate":"1986-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":177703,"FileName":"f5ce1550-9989-4b00-bb50-e4ccf5392974.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":177703,"FileName":"1e905d80-3caf-499f-a93c-89d20c6267a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193370,"Name":"Cuby Panic","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Game Arts","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193370,"FileName":"c8a0ed1c-e5b9-44ca-86a4-29faf39de690.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193370,"FileName":"d10024be-d2e9-49a7-ab67-090a0cf1a886.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193370,"FileName":"ae8754e4-c3f4-4dce-b94c-947390bb96b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193370,"FileName":"1ff74c2c-e672-4f23-ab63-b78b9b446b7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188737,"Name":"Cyberblock Metal Orange","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Cyberblock Metal Orange is an Action game, developed and published by Cybertech Custom, which was released in Japan in 1990","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Cybertech Custom","Publisher":"Cybertech Custom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188737,"FileName":"00c1a435-3f0a-4de7-bcbc-46dec26fc65b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189323,"Name":"Cygnus","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/D4uTeD6h8M8","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Nippon Softech","Publisher":"Nippon Softech","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189323,"FileName":"5a40383b-283e-43db-97b2-6f6fdce48c38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189323,"FileName":"28e1ae6f-888f-44d8-acfb-cbd08f87d582.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189323,"FileName":"ed06b3b3-1d4c-46ea-917c-35dc132bfb48.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197107,"Name":"D'","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"D' (pronounced Dee Dash) is a sci-fi survival horror game for one or two players.

Out of fear of the so-called Highway Buster, people dare no longer use the highways.\n\nAs a student at the Cybernetic Hi-School, the player is given the task by the headmaster of finding out who the Highway Buster is, and ultimately defeat him.\n\nThe game is a minimalistic adventure game, where the player goes around the campus and town using seven commands. Talking to people advances the plot, though the player have no input on what to say, merely receiving what others tell them. Their first task to get on with the case is to get a vehicle, which they are lent by the headmaster. Before they can leave school grounds, though, they must pass a test to get a driving permit. This is where the other main part of the game commences.\n\nDennou Gakuen II: Highway Buster!! is not only an adventure game, but also a strip-quiz game, which is slightly novel compared to the more common strip poker and strip mahjong games. If the player gives the right answers to the driving knowledge test conducted by the female police officer, she will strip for them (for reasons unknown). When she is naked, the player will get their permit, and can leave the premises to find the leader of the school's touring club, who they must also beat in a quiz to see her naked and acquire the driving techniques they will need to beat the Highway Buster. All questions in the game are driving related, although they later on stray from the more mundane legal paragraphs to about car and bike related pop culture trivia.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Quiz","Developer":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Gainax Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188425,"FileName":"282f4ca7-cab9-4e42-9ac5-faf82464b4fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188425,"AlternateName":"Cybernetic Hi-School Part 2: Highway Buster","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188426,"Name":"Dennou Gakuen III: Top o Nerae!","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Just like the two previous Cybernetic Hi-School games, the third part is a strip quiz game.

Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!\n\nDragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188431,"FileName":"f8f281b9-d3d2-47f3-9895-1564bb276164.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196901,"Name":"Dragon Princess: Meikyuu no Madoushi","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"View Tech Soft","Publisher":"Pasoket","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196901,"FileName":"37049967-db94-478e-9672-658d977784db.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196901,"FileName":"6a96e14f-d3bb-4320-8184-fb4479670774.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196901,"FileName":"fac0d12f-5856-4616-a4dc-742b54a91522.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199666,"Name":"Dragon Slayer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and \"bump\" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.\n\nThe player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9-xp8yc80","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1984-09-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":199666,"FileName":"59b6b94c-e77d-41a7-9227-b227162a3375.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":199666,"FileName":"ec42497a-b02a-4842-9262-73297a13810a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199666,"FileName":"8bb50b5c-e889-48ab-8720-20009b47c127.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199666,"FileName":"a12a427b-2194-48a4-b3b9-d983c71f5820.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157832,"Name":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes is the sixth game in the Dragon Slayer line of games, and the first in The Legend of Heroes series.

There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:\nShooting them with his gun.\nKicking them by jumping onto them.\nShooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.\nCrushing them with an elevator.\nWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.\n\nWhile Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall.\n\nJust because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.\n\nOtto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.\n\nIf Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Nidecom Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188438,"FileName":"14de95b7-0a19-412e-9e1c-7d4e3bb2c5c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188438,"FileName":"ea8b5a28-f273-4e71-ab75-ffa122093bf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188438,"FileName":"dcfc8ab0-ce1d-4d27-9716-d367092d9f36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188438,"FileName":"867abe7d-55e9-47a8-aee3-a433c1b273e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188438,"FileName":"17186957-6c70-49ee-82fd-921eae7b2b8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190025,"Name":"Elthlead","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bozel, the King of the East and the Dark Mage.

One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...\n\nThe game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/ldtdYCr7-40","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Basho House","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"e86efb6e-4b24-4fd6-a859-b26d1705d43b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"6385a1f3-eb07-4838-baea-0fd11a1b3489.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"68ffe97d-a702-4f70-ab71-178c753f7dda.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"b2f57fe9-0b40-438c-b089-52f8ceaae3b1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"a567730a-9c8e-42f2-ba58-5259db156164.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"26b3ab9b-0bf9-4b24-a525-22b1d4498796.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"6a912958-8c9e-4e52-b1eb-9011f3177ce2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"e20c571c-f215-4a5b-9648-317a6d2ae3dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188440,"FileName":"07462d19-88f2-4525-b94e-3177ef960cfa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196909,"Name":"Emmy","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Emmy is a curious artificial software girl.

As captain you can choose to operate in silent, normal or emergency running modes; to climb or dive; run on diesel engines or battery power; raise and lower the periscope; charge the batteries; reload torpedoes. Convoys are protected by destroyers and escorts that differ as to the number of weapons they carry and their sonar ability. The U-Boat can sustain damage to the engine room, battery room, torpedo room, torpedo tubes, rudder, periscope, dive planes. Damage limits what functionality the captain can utilise. Damage can be repaired by moving out of the combat zone and returning to Brest.\n\nThere are three patrol missions in each game. The number of ships in each mission will vary. There are three sets of six torpedoes available in each mission. Reloading torpedoes takes 20 seconds. A combination of keyboard and joystick controls are needed to navigate, view through the periscope and attack. After each game, the evaluation screen shows total victory points awarded, total tonnage sunk and gives a final rank. There are three levels of difficulty to master. The manual provides some history on U-Boats, and some useful strategy to consider on your missions - for example the speed of various ship types is provided, and what capabilities each ship has for detecting the U-Boat.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Comptiq","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188445,"FileName":"38ccce00-9b0a-4abf-b7bc-d64c378e33f3.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188445,"FileName":"7ba38559-de4b-4fd8-967b-15fce52f7959.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188445,"FileName":"f1f12100-030c-4515-bd55-f391462c66f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188445,"FileName":"430a5dda-bf78-467c-a80b-721b78e7b44e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188445,"FileName":"7e4ee2b2-b6db-44c2-bbe2-aabf7c1a33e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196914,"Name":"Feirie's Residence","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Champion Soft","Publisher":"Champion Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196914,"FileName":"7bf4bfc4-6786-40b5-a9de-557ab9e66b55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196914,"FileName":"5b41aabe-4425-4396-9f12-39a4c17aec2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":196914,"AlternateName":"Fairie's Residence","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":186802,"Name":"Final Crisis","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Final Crisis - Terrestrial Defense Police is a horizontal shoot 'em up developed and published by Techno Grard in 1991 for the PC 8801.\n\nDespite different team names, this is the work of Group R204, the same doujin circle that did MeltDown (1989) and ReFight (1991), and this is probably one of the most successful products they made.

As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city.\n\nFoxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.\n\nEach unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.\n\nBetween the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188450,"FileName":"41a13949-2e5a-420d-bd3e-97a10e2f236f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188450,"FileName":"fc6d808c-be13-40f6-be8d-682b12951b08.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188450,"FileName":"36b84a07-e5b5-4e36-a3f3-a5ec43b90fdf.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188450,"FileName":"d92a7228-cd5a-4711-aba2-ab2dddf8201a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188450,"FileName":"adfca435-e637-4b61-a35b-f1aaa6522589.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188450,"FileName":"f43324a5-db4e-4089-b12a-e16d7259b1a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188467,"Name":"Front Line","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game.

During his walk, Walky is a prone target for the Nyankys, who will hunt him from all directions. Walky's only defence is to drop on the head of a Nyanky, and his ability to lay bombs, of which he has a limited supply. Only one bomb may be laid at any time, preventing you from covering the screen in bombs. Jumping too many times on the trampoline will make it burst, costing Walky one life. When all fruit are picked, the game proceeds to the next level, with new platforms and another kind of fruit.\n\nFruit Panic has been remade in 1990 as the Game Boy game Tasmania Story.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188468,"FileName":"5520effb-c746-42ec-b936-5afe288f6454.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188468,"FileName":"f3b0b5ba-9651-4308-b5f6-400756c5d55d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188468,"FileName":"ab613512-f20f-4eb9-bee3-098f12196781.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188468,"FileName":"d02cd2c4-b5d8-419a-9608-940d50ae54e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188468,"FileName":"9f2d1604-461f-4052-8982-d44fc7e85677.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188469,"Name":"Fruits Fields","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Fruits Fields is a puzzle game where the object is to collect all the fruit.

It’s the direct predecessor to the Langrisser series (occasionally known as Warsong), which had as extensive a hand in defining the console SRPG genre as Nectaris and Fire Emblem.\n\nThe player controls the army of the Land of Light, and has to repel the evil overlord Böser and his monsters. The player must build their army by spending points/cash earned in the previous battle to acquire new units before the next. In order to maximize the player's chances of victory, they have to defeat as many enemy units as possible without letting them escape while securing their own units' safety to have the most spending money for the following conflict. Points are awarded based on the strength of the defeated enemy, but points are lost if members of your army are defeated. Turns do not necessarily alternate between the player and the computer. Rather, the side which begins a new round is determined by a coin toss.\n\nIt was originally released in 1987 for the NEC PC-8801 computer. The game also has a Construction Mode that allows the player to create their own scenarios with units not found in the main game. These range from sci-fi units to members of Masaya's development team.

The hero's task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.\n\nOne of Enix's works that were unreleased outside of Japan, Gandhara is an action RPG with rather simple gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through hostile top-down areas, fighting constantly respawning enemies with sword or magical spells. Rations must be bought in order to keep the hero alive. Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Enix Corporation","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"226b9c8d-4b51-4608-b510-8edcbfc46d94.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"ede63341-31b5-4e09-a3a0-191def0503e5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"8d10e1e0-fa2e-47bb-b48e-2f92f3ba76ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"61bb1235-01bc-4152-a28e-419d1a233e05.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"2a3195d8-d9b1-4618-a962-7e126042f71f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"dc805ee5-002b-41e2-ab40-a8a46fc7036a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"d89cdce7-fb10-4937-9af7-9561b16b4a3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186819,"FileName":"76ac8e89-a2ab-478c-a56a-2ac639c728b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186819,"AlternateName":"Gandhara","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188479,"Name":"Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze was the first adventure developed by Wolf Team.

Players work their way through an underground catacomb, doing three things at once. First they need to find five pieces of a gemstone, spread throughout the maze. Second they need to avoid getting killed by the guardians of the catacomb. Finally they need to map the game, because the place is so large that it is easy to get lost. Once the Gemstone Warrior has collected the five gemstone pieces, he needs to move back to the point where he began the game.\n\nThe hero has to go underground because of demons. They stole the gemstone from humans, because they were jealous of the good magic it brought to humankind. They broke it up and spread it throughout their dungeon, to hide it.\n\nThis game is not just a \"shoot-em-up\"; it has many of the features of that style of game, but also gives players time to think. It includes a pause which helps one map and also to freeze a room, to see what is running toward the Gemstone Warrior. The game also has a save feature, which is useful just before entering a new room: if the Gemstone Warrior is ambushed, players can give him another chance.\n\nAfter killing opponents, the Gemstone Warrior has the opportunity to search the bodies for treasure. Monsters carry arrows, and also \"magic bolts.\" The latter are interesting, as they destroy treasure too, as well as the Gemstone Warrior, should he be too close to the explosion. Magic items abound, and help the warrior make it through the caverns. Some magic items are traps too; there is a healing potion bottle that is similar to a poison bottle. Other magic items include effects to freeze opponents, turn the warrior invisible, hide him among monsters with an illusion, annihilate all opponents in the current cavern, and cure disease.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Paradigm Creators, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188480,"FileName":"01e26b53-68d3-4ee5-87b9-cbf5d841223f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188480,"FileName":"011e9d42-a8dd-440f-ac8c-2dda973957b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188480,"FileName":"7b9148a3-f29f-4f06-8a6a-6162a12bc5f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188480,"FileName":"4f30228b-2249-4d98-b499-571f6ab9d83c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188481,"Name":"Genesis","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"A series of devastating wars and economic disasters influenced the Earth's atmosphere. Various types of energy were released, and as a result the planet's continents began to change shapes. The ensuing cataclysm deformed the Earth's surface, and it changed beyond recognition. Most of the planet turned into a desert. But humanity survived. Humans built new cities in the wilderness, and new organizations emerged. Surviving in this world will be anything but easy...\n\nGenesis is an early RPG by Square, which is still much more heavily influenced by the leading Ultima template of the time than their later famous work, Final Fantasy. With the exception of the original post-apocalyptic theme and a few original gameplay elements, the game looks, feels, and plays very similarly to early Ultimas.\n\nIn the beginning of the game the player has to create and name the protagonist. Four classes are available: Soldier, an all-purpose fighter type; Karateka, specialist in unarmed combat; Esper, who relies on psychic forces; and Doctor, who focuses on healing. The player can freely allocate points into the four available character attributes: Strength, Duration (Endurance), Dexterity, and IQ.\n\nAfterwards, the player is thrown into the game world. Gameplay process is non-linear; rather than following a narrative with scripted events, the player explores the world and travels to its locations in any order. Interaction with the world is performed with menu commands such as \"Attack\", \"Enter\" (a location represented on the map as an icon), \"Transaction\", etc. Enemies are visibly roaming the world map; a contact with any of them leads to a separate small isometric battle screen, on which the playable character can freely move, attack physically, or use psychic powers in turn-based fashion.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Square Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Square Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188481,"FileName":"105ad7e4-bda9-412e-a6a8-2c20a782782c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188481,"FileName":"27864352-2067-4959-8904-0eec06d3956b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188481,"FileName":"2bbbe3f1-3eda-47d5-ac9c-d2ac52903d83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188481,"FileName":"c6232c6c-bc93-40dc-8380-771ca36ea598.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188481,"FileName":"2cefc3f7-5d87-4ce7-a53f-3f11dc439156.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188481,"AlternateName":"Genesis: Beyond the Revelation","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":196926,"Name":"Genji","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Gamu","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196926,"FileName":"0b2a0374-afbc-4f1b-b849-6961e7841472.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196926,"FileName":"4e058021-f842-40a9-a6c9-04dbf3c7654e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188483,"Name":"Genma Taisen","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The Judgment Day is nearing.

Though there are characters with attributes and psionic powers assigned to them, game advancement is automated and player input is reduced to making choices (mostly \"Yes\" or \"No\") or occasionally selecting a character and an attack type for an upcoming confrontation.

There are five possible scenarios in the game. Unlike the first game, there is an option to choose which space fleet to control (Imperial or Alliance) for each scenario. The player takes control of planets allied with the chosen state. It is possible to deploy an entire fleet of a planet into the battle, or have it supply separate units. The players navigates the units (space ships of different kinds) on the top-down map in turn-based fashion, attacking or defending against enemy ships. The ship encounters are automatic and displayed as small animated cut-scenes.

The story progression relies more on direct dialogue and usage of items than on \"triggering\" events by repeatedly selecting commands.

Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes.\n\nAnother now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.\n\nThe opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.\n\nThe game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189882,"FileName":"6ed97d25-9d1e-4a9e-a85e-826bcdfce124.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189882,"FileName":"cad8d1b9-1308-412a-9540-d7050e153f44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189882,"FileName":"a869577c-a7ab-4dce-82a5-4923a328092e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189882,"FileName":"d2e91eef-a61a-496b-9457-b72c34218e91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189882,"FileName":"e30f83ef-11fb-4002-ab84-88157e208320.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189882,"FileName":"2eec9e7b-8f8d-43f2-9020-54db66b07508.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190038,"Name":"Hiatari Ryoukou!","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The story focuses on the relationships of Kasumi Kishimoto, a high school student.

Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) refers to a product of Japanese sex doll industry commonly known as \"dutchwives\". One of such sex dolls has been stolen, and the Oranda Corporation hires a private investigator to retrieve it.\n\nThe second entry in Koei's self-proclaimed \"Strawberry Porno\" series (following Danchi-zuma no Yūwaku) has certain similarities to its predecessor in interface and overall concept. However, it is a much more open-ended game with emphasis on gradual exploration and interaction, which gives it a definite role-playing flavor in addition to basic adventure-like gameplay.\n\nLike in the preceding game, the player character is generated by stopping rapidly revolving counters assigned to individual parameters. These parameters influence the chance of success in subsequent encounters with women, though much of it is calculated randomly. The player area is a fairly vast top-down urban environment consisting of numerous interconnected screens, which are mapped as the player explores them.\n\nThe streets are populated by various types of NPCs. These include young women who would sleep with the main character for money, yakuza thugs who would attack if provoked, policemen, etc. These characters are randomly generated. The map also includes various locations such as several love hotels, adult shops, fast food restaurants, phone booths and police stations. The protagonist can spend money on various items sold in these establishments, bring women to love hotels, or try his luck with hostesses. The ultimate goal of finding the missing sex doll can be achieved by acquiring a few key items and finding the right NPCs among many others.\n\nThe interaction on the streets consists of inputting the key-bound commands Look, Transact, Attack, Present, and Rape. The latter command can be used on certain types of women on the streets (provided there are no witnesses) and leads to the so-called \"Fuck Mode\", which can also be brought forth by having consensual sex with hookers or indoor female characters. This mode features a few sex-related commands.\n\nIn addition, indoor locations have their own set of commands bound to function keys. These include making a phone call, various types of conversation (nice, normal, aggressive, etc.), attacking, attempting to have sex, etc. Attacking usually leads to a separate first-person combat screen. Combat is turn-based and has its own set of commands (attack with weapon, attack with bare hands, etc.). There are no experience points awarded, but the protagonist's hit points decrease when the enemy manages to damage him.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188626,"FileName":"76b9ebee-c437-4058-86b9-4cb872ccb545.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188626,"FileName":"e3a65852-6d9e-4cc4-b122-1003f002423c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188626,"FileName":"6fc13c21-855d-4251-a395-a5b9799716db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188626,"FileName":"57c5c6bf-d8ab-45f2-aef5-1d95f7bc8dea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188626,"FileName":"fe9db1f6-a89e-4ad7-b7da-8cd0e18b265e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188626,"FileName":"b9e8fbe8-ade7-46af-a625-b70a02e1d917.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":188626,"AlternateName":"Oranda Tsuma wa Denki Unagi no Yume o Miru ka?","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":190042,"Name":"Holy Grail","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Holy Grail is an Action game, developed and published by Seinsoft, which was released in Japan in 1985.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Sein Soft","Publisher":"Sein Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190042,"FileName":"5fc973a9-6404-4221-a6e6-fe2964fa7dfb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190042,"FileName":"6adb69c3-4bf0-4a36-a939-a6a10622076f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190042,"FileName":"374e665d-90d2-49a6-a0c5-5b69b8411ab7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190042,"FileName":"28378f63-6c26-4ea2-997a-a0850b29eef7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190043,"Name":"Holy Sword","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Xtalsoft","Publisher":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190043,"FileName":"2827a659-cbcf-497e-beb5-49027eefae59.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190043,"FileName":"0dd32cc6-d384-45f2-90c9-3bd01d84955a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190043,"FileName":"393b9915-3038-4997-b791-2e52ba2a57d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190043,"FileName":"320c390c-0cf5-4e57-b13f-ba322e5b0c80.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188509,"Name":"Hoshi no Suna Monogatari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gengorou Imai is a 19-year old lad who wants to have a simple life, his only passion being young pretty women.

When the player finally reaches the top, it's time to move on to the next, more difficult level.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnAK5yvpSyo","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1985-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140885,"FileName":"0f09c0b3-4595-4d10-9ef2-60f8377ee1fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140885,"FileName":"a07698a7-e509-4a7c-bd75-7e60b625e078.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140885,"FileName":"54adf038-0297-4d3e-96f0-13c0229d1362.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196944,"Name":"Idaten Ikase Otoko: Mugiko ni Aitai","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Family Soft","Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196944,"FileName":"54816f33-096e-4404-b491-da70225386c5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196944,"FileName":"f63f1d4f-845f-48a8-81bc-f588f83ff5d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196944,"FileName":"22fa92ea-6437-4439-8916-9487e13a36ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196944,"FileName":"0076b24a-a9c0-494b-a412-0a00fbb1e381.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196946,"Name":"Ikenie no Machi","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Adult Inn","Publisher":"Studio Panther","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196946,"FileName":"7a805fba-5711-4467-b08f-8cb5932d1eb8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196946,"FileName":"ea76dc7b-e107-4b2f-9254-582227bc4840.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188515,"Name":"Illumina!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A young man wakes up, only to find himself in a bed, in an unknown house, in an unknown place.

The random, turn-based battles are also first-person, but the dungeons have the same top-down view as the map.

For the most part, they succeeded to hide their identity, living among humans; but humans have always mistrusted their supernatural abilities and mercilessly killed them whenever they were spotted, such as for example during the medieval witch hunts. Finally, the Third World War in the 21st century saw the Rapp people as scapegoats. They were hunted down and forced to hide in the ruins of New York. The protagonist of the game initially participates in combat against Rapp people, but is later saved by them and taught psychic powers, effectively becoming a Rapp himself. From that moment on, the hero swears to free the Rapp people and restore peace.\n\nIn The Psychic City is a Japanese-made RPG; gameplay-wise, it is more similar to Western games, though it contains some original ideas of its own. The player creates the main character by distributing skill points. The skills include Shield, Telepathy, Psychokinesis, and others. Some of them have to be used outside of combat in order to advance in the game.\n\nThe game uses very simple graphics, with the main character represented as a square on a top-down map. The player navigates the map, sometimes using psychic powers to access new areas, and fighting enemies that occasionally pop up in turn-based fashion. The fights are viewed from a first-person perspective, and the enemies are mostly restricted to robotic and mechanical creatures.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Hot-B","Publisher":"Hot-B","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186813,"FileName":"016d5868-85ce-4901-ad51-731068430cce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186813,"FileName":"827d72ee-3258-4f09-956c-ca2f0feb030f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186813,"FileName":"ede9006a-9f92-43d5-8f49-f05e33e0aa14.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186813,"FileName":"243bb2ac-cadc-4088-b787-515c5aed5bb7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186813,"FileName":"dbf4f84c-37ef-40d1-b0ec-4521e92eadf3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188516,"Name":"Inindou: Datou Nobunaga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1581, Japan.

Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188521,"FileName":"16bdfeb2-392e-43f5-be99-77647fe0c37e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188521,"FileName":"dd2299f4-8f6f-44ae-b9c6-b05893e3ef13.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188521,"FileName":"07dd69ff-7d8a-41e3-82ef-02d7059cabd3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188521,"FileName":"f51142b4-a7a7-4a09-84f2-81f1846ca3d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196948,"Name":"Isseki ni Kakeru Seishun","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"LOG","Publisher":"LOG","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196948,"FileName":"95369fbf-8b14-4b63-9007-faebdcc39398.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196948,"FileName":"2d724548-d613-42e8-8364-5e31f8cf3bab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":196948,"FileName":"8c988762-4d32-4bb6-84f7-40f9d597597b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196948,"FileName":"a32462d6-569a-4494-abd6-edafe2db899f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196948,"FileName":"144fba8c-de2e-4fa7-987c-cca93ae5d387.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188744,"Name":"J.B.

Like before, the player types text commands consisting of combinations of verbs and objects. The game recognizes both Japanese and English inputs.\n\nThe major difference is the inclusion of graphics. Each location is represented by an anime-style image. With the exception of flashing lights and alike, there is no animation, though a few actions lead to separate zoomed-in scenes appearing on top of the main image. The game's visuals are sexually more explicit than Leisure Suit Larry. For example, the hooker is partially nude, and there are also visible obscene drawings on the bathroom walls.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"6c7ef688-5fdc-466f-9a9f-512c6ed82b38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"ee6a4646-a2f7-4431-b768-0254059230ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"dac5c744-ec62-4ca9-9f64-200159227507.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"8d5b73e9-883f-4ace-82ab-87d5d60d014d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"08c5e720-0352-4297-b9de-320f885a3b69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"cb1478b4-d234-4584-878c-fa5038989746.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"bf4a5a50-7d9f-4baa-a78e-b9c2c16f4eb4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188576,"FileName":"f3210dad-72dd-4a69-9f96-f7f0fe9312d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188575,"Name":"Last Armageddon","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/yWEDrrJL0Js","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"BrainGrey","Publisher":"BrainGrey","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188575,"FileName":"09adbc86-4155-476e-943a-fefe6d772064.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188575,"FileName":"840b7ab0-438e-4fd4-87c0-0d1160c54eb3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188575,"FileName":"feb95baa-024b-4610-af17-181be94265c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190076,"Name":"Last Target","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Seed Software","Publisher":"Seed Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190076,"FileName":"9266c08a-8282-41a8-ad98-aadde072b9f4.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190076,"FileName":"3748eac2-c994-4c37-aa5c-58efc72d6449.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190076,"FileName":"26481b89-c82e-4453-b34a-92ab3b4e58b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190076,"FileName":"c592d0f4-f33a-4c58-bdd6-a1430febf7c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190076,"FileName":"e74210f9-270e-43e2-8ca5-8d2002208c73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188577,"Name":"Law of the West","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The West is out of control and a new sheriff is in town.

Lolita Syndrome was the winning game of the second Hobby Program Contest sponsored by Enix.\n\nLolita Syndrome consists of four \"rooms\" (scenes), each shaped like a mini-game and each presenting a different young girl in a dangerous situation. These mini-games require little skill and are mostly based on guessing. For example, in one scene the player has to select numbered knives which are then thrown at the girl, hoping not to choose the two knives that will actually hurt her and end the game. Other mini-games involve selecting random keys to stop a torture device from killing the girl, inputting a few text commands to cure a sick girl, and participate in a rock-paper-scissors game. The fifth room contains no game and only consists of pictures. A successful completion of each stage leads images of naked girls.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Horror","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":140886,"FileName":"5129ea2f-5027-4d28-982a-7616c3a5317d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140886,"FileName":"d4141079-fdb9-4895-ab2f-00e20376aa4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":140886,"FileName":"a610e56c-eb99-4c27-9feb-14b9d9ce85bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":140886,"AlternateName":"ロリータ・シンドローム","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":193387,"Name":"Lord Over","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193387,"FileName":"426e1b50-0a68-4cf4-a3a8-6d0f0e8eb53b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193387,"FileName":"66faa7a8-9e64-4c7c-940f-d8df4e876e33.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193388,"Name":"Lost Power","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"The Makai is ruled by a number of demon lords, each vying for higher status on the food chain by devouring each other and increasing their strength.

One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...\n\nLa Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.\n\nHowever, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.\n\nThe entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no \"world map\", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on \"level-grinding\"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"2dcaa7ed-18ef-4ef5-8a65-cd4a3817036c.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"00bc5e3c-9fc9-4498-be79-b24f47959794.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"1215b0f8-3791-44c8-993d-deef46ec087b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"ed040292-0a48-4224-a2bf-cd39662dd781.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"4f599055-4b79-4924-80e8-ce919cc11e06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"9ecef586-02e6-4ee6-9a5f-39c6e323657e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"6c53d306-5084-45a0-b63e-a6e4ed4887e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180987,"FileName":"607d39d9-82f7-44fb-b192-9254bf1b137f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":180987,"AlternateName":"Mashō Denki: La Valeur","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":188597,"Name":"Masquerade","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"You are a detective and you are really struggling with your latest case as you try to bring down a crime boss.

Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"SystemSoft","Publisher":"SystemSoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188598,"FileName":"e4a64476-34e0-4794-8759-d6e135837fa5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197012,"Name":"Mayonaka no Love Call","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Mika and her boyfriend are having an intimate telephone talk with her becoming excited with each right answer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Studio Angel","Publisher":"Zenryuutsuu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197012,"FileName":"5bc51d4f-73df-482c-b604-e1c0a17345a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197012,"FileName":"992d7c12-348c-474d-ba9f-644403cc4e57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193393,"Name":"Maze Kun","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/oRfZ6HEoMI8","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Atlas","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193393,"FileName":"e378b9f2-14c6-4e0e-9a85-1c1aa54c52b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193394,"Name":"Meitantei Toujou!","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":193394,"FileName":"9f99ddac-2ef4-421b-a287-9b8be95a5d28.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193394,"FileName":"9e4750e4-8769-4246-a53b-e11b88f6c057.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":193394,"FileName":"b134fd22-6292-4215-9d03-6c6321a219e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":193394,"FileName":"35dd3114-15be-4a42-88fd-a49071836f80.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197013,"Name":"Melon Soda: Sexy Pet","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Bond Soft","Publisher":"Pascal II","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197013,"FileName":"1897b047-79d6-40fa-a471-4f96775afc75.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197013,"FileName":"d1a1f06f-4ed2-46e5-8425-89464e9e82ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197013,"FileName":"4905bcd6-f048-4f5d-8a6d-21964d232ca5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197014,"Name":"Meo no Mystery Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You get caught in the rain and hide in the mansion.

Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.\n\nThe Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the game environment consists of maze-like passages made with pseudo-3D graphics.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player creates a party of six adventurers. There are six classes to choose from: knight, robber, sorcerer, cleric, paladin, and archer. Each character has six main attributes: might, endurance, accuracy, personality, intelligence, and luck, with each class requires proficiency in a specific attribute for effective functioning. There are also five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\n\nAs in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The party starts in a particularly weak state, equipped with only clubs and having no money. The player is free to explore most of the game's locations in any order, and there are few hints as to what needs to be done to advance the plot. Turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies typically take place against a group of monsters more or less equal in size to the player-controlled party, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain. It is also possible to try and bribe enemies or surrender to them before entering combat.\n\nThe game has no auto-mapping feature of any kind and it is only possible to save the player's progress at inns located in towns.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188601,"FileName":"16483f80-e21b-4e9f-bd31-7aeff97c96a9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188601,"FileName":"314e3b6b-353c-480f-89d7-2db377721d47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188602,"Name":"Might and Magic: Book Two: Gates to Another World!","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.\n\nGates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188602,"FileName":"5467b861-129b-4961-8964-cdc0a0cb6526.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188602,"FileName":"6c820c95-afa4-404a-ad9b-73a3b07297aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188602,"FileName":"c5179f86-25d5-41bf-8d36-f5470bfa0330.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188602,"FileName":"20cc2975-fc6e-4cf6-8652-68533a6a6700.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188602,"FileName":"f29668b7-4d1f-4781-a881-a25a65fddaae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190086,"Name":"Miko to Akemi no Jungle Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Miko and Akemi went on a long-awaited African trip, but their airplane crashed.

To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there.\n\nYou can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon).

This land suffers under the yoke of the evil Prince of Darkness, and it's up to the hero to deal with him and find a way to leave this world.\n\nMugen no Shinzō II is a role-playing game very similar visually and gameplay-wise to early Ultima games. As opposed to the first game, overworld occupies the majority of the screen, and towns can be physically explored in a top-down fashion. Another change is elimination of random enemy encounters in favor of enemies visibly roaming the overworld. Characters can now join the protagonist and participate in battles. Battles are viewed from first-person perspective (with large enemy portraits) and feature simple turn-based mechanics.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188612,"FileName":"06c0de2d-3f70-4c51-b981-545b72b00e40.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188612,"FileName":"0ddd24ca-5d6a-4424-8d72-c8c89c438244.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188612,"FileName":"d83832c5-9699-48aa-98a1-1d7abe79fcb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188613,"Name":"Mugen no Shinzou III","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"After having traveled to two magical realms, the hero was finally able to leave the world of Elderein and return to his own world, Luizard.

He must use the Heart of Phantasm he found during his first adventure, and locate other heroes who would aid him on his quest and liberate the land.\n\nMugen no Shinzō III is in many ways quite different from its Ultima-inspired predecessor. Story progression is more linear, exploration more restricted; characters with their own backgrounds join the party, taking a cue from Japanese RPG design. However, the game doesn't have anime aesthetics characteristic of these games. Enemies are visibly roaming the overworld and dungeons; an encounter leads to a separate top-down battle screen, on which combat proceeds in real time, unless the player interferes and manually assigns commands to the characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Xtalsoft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"841a833e-faeb-4b34-9a46-5109265befeb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"f50c4c7c-6c8f-4dae-87d6-dc375d127678.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"eb79cb50-4dbc-4ba0-94ab-dfd06f83f17e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"b1413be4-85a3-443b-b9d4-697f4b872b1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"03911704-e1d5-4846-b66d-03b51a169dec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"e371baa2-79b6-429b-8fa2-974c4b2c6356.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"888ace5f-bd51-43d7-b749-3817df581886.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188613,"FileName":"27a50998-de7a-49bd-84ce-2f48967795e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":139246,"Name":"Mugen Senshi Valis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":139246,"FileName":"4ec07614-cc00-4fbc-845c-39099484fea9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139246,"FileName":"3fb76520-3fe7-416c-8548-69f34bc3b7fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139246,"FileName":"1a0a9a5b-28ab-4e6b-95eb-ba5ddbc38d47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":139246,"AlternateName":"Valis","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":139258,"Name":"Mugen Senshi Valis II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Renovation Game","Publisher":"Telenet Japan","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":139258,"FileName":"8f71dd1b-abb1-43c0-b570-b44054995771.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139258,"FileName":"5e7504df-4228-4db9-bab8-ca3b69a11dab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139258,"FileName":"0fc8143b-3ff9-48d1-ac91-79c9af53276a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139258,"FileName":"2dc594d8-9743-44be-95a4-639965bda4e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":139258,"AlternateName":"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier II","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":188614,"Name":"Murder Club","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Murder Club is an adventure game with simulation elements.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nNobunaga no Yabou: Zenkokuban is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\n\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188622,"FileName":"0ab3a45d-e36b-4903-9431-32199c361014.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188622,"FileName":"394556e2-72d2-4d67-980a-1f594a61d55d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188622,"FileName":"b6c9714b-f3d1-459c-8483-70500f7262db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190096,"Name":"Nukenin Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Nukenin Densetsu is an Action game, developed and published by Brain Grey, which was released in Japan in 1987.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/iHWcwVriD7E","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Brain Grey","Publisher":"Brain Grey","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"7e602b94-8e95-4cc9-a539-7c4880523d4d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"639a2329-c0c6-4328-b641-f5340dc8e09f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"bc18e994-199a-472c-bdfb-637fb29bc2a3.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"f7782421-caa1-4bdd-a2f8-823837c37777.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"8d1c2bfd-87db-4db0-8d5a-b0f9fe394b15.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"df7bdbb2-3070-4d60-84c0-df28e1a85e1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"e126e939-c14f-413f-91d4-7b31ce67d092.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"27c5642a-fcd5-4441-a906-206e660d6ed1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190096,"FileName":"d5cb9f41-50f5-43fe-8338-98de86dd84f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188623,"Name":"Ogre","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Ogre is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson's board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers.

Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.\n\nThe game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.\n\nThe gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Bear's Corporation","Publisher":"Toshiba-EMI Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188627,"FileName":"92751efd-2f59-426d-8e76-e9122331176a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188627,"FileName":"dd218d0d-0a72-4097-ad81-5a89930d2e60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188627,"FileName":"ce4ae266-872e-402d-8829-90be4779766a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188627,"FileName":"b6030d1d-ae6e-4f2c-8c2b-52d31f22145d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200165,"Name":"Pac-Land","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Pac-Land is a side-scrolling game with a cartoony feel to it.

Battles allow specific commands such as \"Thrust\", \"Parry\", \"Throw\", etc., and - similarly to the third game - placement of the characters in rows on the battle screen.\n\nA new feature is the possibility to choose parents for the characters the player creates. They can both belong to the same race, or produce an offspring in a mixed marriage - which, naturally, influences the newborn's parameters, affinities, etc. Theoretically, it is possible to create a party that consists entirely of children born to troll fathers and gnoll mothers; however, these \"random creatures\" (unlike the privileged races such as humans, dwarves, and elves) can only be either thieves or fighters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"StarCraft, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188635,"FileName":"5754be3a-80bb-4b02-a46f-e0d02330b2ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188635,"FileName":"13ebc03e-519c-4f72-88aa-abe0da338e1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188635,"FileName":"8f93c5ce-08ba-4377-8d8a-d81d99a8a23c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188636,"Name":"Pias","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Hiroshi and Mayumi grew up together.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"The Assembly Line","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188641,"FileName":"66fa3bf1-bf5b-4642-bfcd-902a2de46110.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188641,"FileName":"127411c5-bef1-47a5-9cb6-91cbca341dbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188641,"FileName":"7857139d-df2c-4922-829a-ce064df79594.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188642,"Name":"Pirate Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"This is adventure #2 in Scott Adam's text adventure series.

Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite \"Raiden\". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, \"Racoon\", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship \"Septemius 2\", was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.\n\nPsy-O-Blade is a Japanese adventure in anime style.

However, unlike the original game where Mario must flip enemies by hitting the platform they're on from underneath, in Punch Ball, Mario (and optionally a second player as Luigi) carries a red ball which can be thrown at enemies to knock them over. The ball must be picked back up after being thrown.\n\nEvery few stages, there is a bonus coin round with no enemies. Most stages also feature a POW block in the center, which can be hit a limited number of times to flip every enemy on the screen. There is also a small pit in the center of the screen at the bottom, into which Mario can fall if he isn't careful.

A lazy but patriotic young man who grew up in the same village agrees to organize a world-wide running competition that will hopefully bring glory to the village.\n\nRun Run Kyousoukyoku is an arcade-style on-foot racing game. It uses a split-screen side-scrolling view and can be player against computer-controlled opponents or in a two-player mode. The latter allows players to choose any stage, while the former follows a linear set of levels, starting in Tokyo and advancing to the USA via China and Europe. The courses typically feature platforming sections alongside flat terrain; it is usually required to jump in a timed fashion to succeed, and jumps can vary in height and length depending on how long the player holds the correspondent key. Runners would also take falling damage in certain spots.\n\nPlayers have ten female runners at their disposal. Each has her own attributes in four categories: jumping, speed, vitality, and stamina. The vitality parameter affects the time needed for the runner to recover after falling down; stamina influences the steadiness of the speed throughout the whole course. Each stage consists of the three races. If the player loses one but wins the other two, a mildly explicit erotic picture of a generic girl corresponding to the stage's country is shown. Should the player win the first two races two more explicit images are shown.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Racing","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"cd05e488-6087-4452-870d-0a01d8af62fd.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"7ceefc89-7cc6-4430-879e-105aa7e5dbc2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"25947c93-84ac-4033-a17d-ec6d3d6cb41c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"ade31b35-6c66-47d3-a2cc-132a09b3c330.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"d4d5cdaa-a19a-4e62-8c03-8384bb9318cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"8772f7aa-6434-4b9b-98d5-e0fbb8e6c64f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"4a627aa0-3ccc-473d-aae8-094b998fd85c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188658,"FileName":"eb4dc7bf-bf3e-4fa9-9414-2c57ea21bb50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190125,"Name":"Rune Worth: Kokui no Kikoushi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/FAwtdUfMx-E","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"T&E Soft","Publisher":"T&E Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-12T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190125,"FileName":"ee0967eb-4b73-4305-a37e-8d76b0afcd1a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190125,"FileName":"69c385e4-0c7f-4e72-b236-bd33d21f94fe.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190125,"FileName":"2059d4c1-d5bc-4357-9b0d-4179edb8633c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190125,"FileName":"7f7e2b66-a115-4b49-953c-3c10bdb936e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190125,"FileName":"ee4e92f5-202b-4e93-8543-b6e9b9e8a8ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197053,"Name":"S.F.3.D Original: Operation Thanksgiving","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cross Media Soft","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197053,"FileName":"1a057d08-4a1a-4cb0-a9f0-345082928c9c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197053,"FileName":"ad882781-40ca-4a77-9ed2-0cdff8a7d5e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":197053,"AlternateName":"S.F.3.D Point X Senryou Sakusen: Operation Thanksgiving","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":197054,"Name":"Sailor-fuku Senshi Felis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Kirara","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197054,"FileName":"d3429ad2-3212-4092-8f06-dd2a98a10fdb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":197054,"FileName":"48a174ff-7453-4386-a480-49eeec09454d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197054,"FileName":"f2b81ba2-1289-476d-9d24-1af75d585a8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197054,"FileName":"c362c24b-d3be-43b3-9236-8977db486e2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197055,"Name":"Saku Saku Dai Goutou Returns","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Tanaka Brothers","Publisher":"A-Inn","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197055,"FileName":"896625df-e9f2-4cc1-95d8-7477149ecbd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197055,"FileName":"938ffac9-f605-4ed5-91d7-d5c5f1d386e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197055,"FileName":"340c838f-fdb4-4739-a0c0-c25ace05cf77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":197055,"AlternateName":"Sakusaku Dai Goutou Returns","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":181042,"Name":"Salad no Kuni no Tomato-hime","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"The evil Minister Pumpkin betrayed his king, kidnapped his daughter, the lovely Princess Tomato, and began to terrorize the land of vegetables.

Essentially it is a hybrid of a role-playing and a real-time strategy game. Initially the player controls only Lancelot himself, but soon thereafter he becomes the leader of the first team, and eventually the player is put in control of several teams containing a dozen or more soldiers each. It is possible to switch between teams at almost any time and explore different areas.\n\nThe player physically controls only the team leader, navigating him or her through interconnected overhead areas. Battles flow in real time and are automatized for everyone except the leader, which must be controlled manually. In order to prevail, however, it is necessary to assemble and outfit teams properly, judging the nature of upcoming battles in advance. Each team member has his or her own statistics and grows up in levels as they vanquish enemies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/MCHduQ6OnFg","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Kure Software Koubou","Publisher":"Kure Software Koubou","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190133,"FileName":"1813abd4-3b8b-4733-8601-458a7aee1bb5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190133,"FileName":"8697f260-73f5-45c1-adc0-3cd6981a8c8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190133,"FileName":"145183f1-136c-42ae-b4fa-7310930b7a94.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190133,"FileName":"92199628-68d3-442d-9792-19bd1f3a6e06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190133,"FileName":"2528bdf6-96f9-48b7-a958-931865dee394.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188670,"Name":"Skapon Taikentai: The Enchanted Hunters","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The year is 2028.

The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called \"Snatchers\" because they \"snatch\" their victims before they take their place.\n\nA new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as \"Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers\" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — is it a person or a snatcher?\n\nThe player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.\n\nDuring key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Konami Industry Co.

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.\n\nThe game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.\n\nThe view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/bJCP6riUcRU","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"3deb842e-9ece-4eba-a2ad-de9b4f752f3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"348890c3-bf3c-4bcc-a477-c69f6e798611.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"28b6d861-2431-435e-9829-2d5add0e251b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"05bbbdfc-3748-43df-a59f-fb70c5b73743.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"475eaa5d-0b43-4dca-a3c5-092c09096dc4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"42b54675-c19c-40f0-85fa-3c189a057436.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188677,"FileName":"f97e6ec8-16b7-4e4d-8cf6-57765be8676d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190135,"Name":"Southern Cross","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/5gKBpH625KI","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Bandai","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190135,"FileName":"379ac412-a4b5-4beb-8187-43290bd4c1fe.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190135,"FileName":"ec8c302f-3842-47e8-ba72-2f35cd864dc7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190135,"FileName":"60fc74ce-70dd-4d23-bd3a-ac2ded296cdd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190135,"FileName":"6cf4a94a-0e60-4f35-982a-9780e66fc8c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190136,"Name":"Space Cruiser","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Carry Lab","Publisher":"Nidecom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190136,"FileName":"a817c8b5-5eec-41df-a245-bfd1510dd9ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190136,"FileName":"001b0c99-0ad2-46f9-8a08-91cc3e2168e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190136,"FileName":"68d9c45a-b9b8-47f9-ae27-78dffff512c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188678,"Name":"Space Harrier","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens.

These types include planes, helicopters, mobile rocket launchers, ships, trucks, etc. All these can only be positioned on hexagons adjacent to a T.D.F. base.\n\nThe monsters are mostly dragon-like in appearance and consist of a few varieties. Whenever a player-controlled unit and a monster are within each other's range an automatic battle sequence follows, displayed as a small animated sequence in the lower part of the screen. Depending on the version of the game, nine to fifteen different maps are available, distinguished by the shape of the displayed area, terrain types (grassland, desert, water, etc.), and so on.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188687,"FileName":"7a4c0cfd-6832-4e3c-ba2f-3f4e24af31a7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188687,"FileName":"8f977587-6c5e-4221-8960-224a25b5a2c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188687,"FileName":"98830908-4232-4dbc-8d0f-3064b49b61cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188687,"FileName":"fbd13d8d-fc62-46a9-9527-57dd8041458a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188687,"FileName":"0a34d8d0-36e2-4039-bed3-0136a1660dc4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188765,"Name":"Teitoku no Ketsudan","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Teitoku no Ketsudan (P.T.O.) is another military sim from KOEI.

These choices may influence the plot and lead the game to different endings, most of which are considered \"false\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181007,"FileName":"530f42a8-c941-4a68-83f5-a25252200fe5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181007,"FileName":"7ff6d173-b8b4-4de4-b443-5aeec9968a24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181007,"FileName":"ae769760-974b-4658-80c2-00463ae51dac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":181007,"AlternateName":"Dual Targets: The 4th Unit Act.3","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":181008,"Name":"The 4th Unit Act.4: Zero","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zerø is the fourth entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to Dual Targets.

The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.\n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Evryware","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"4c54f3be-aaab-487e-97e6-8db23647ae3b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"a8b833bc-d27f-4b70-b321-43032c2f9dc7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"bbc4a8e5-b148-42d4-a4e1-823967abf562.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"e6504651-4f94-4c80-999e-a26879f778fc.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"21e3c859-598a-4279-b4fb-d465be7fc6fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"31cbba69-8ded-424b-980f-c203761cb292.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187813,"FileName":"a4d0c324-a8ac-48d8-9c96-ab846f9764db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189982,"Name":"The Big Oil King","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The Big Oil King is a simulation game for 1-4 players.\n\nThe goal is to become filthy rich and the titular oil king by buying oil fields.

The king tries to find Shion, but forces of darkness have plans of their own...\n\nDespite its RPG-like premise and interface, The Old Village Story is a pure adventure game. The player navigates Shion (and another character during the second half of the game) through top-down environments, exploring towns and wilderness areas, entering buildings, and talking to people to gather information and advance the plot. There are no real puzzles in the game, and the challenge lies mostly in finding the right path in maze-like locations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Enix Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181079,"FileName":"16cc1518-34ce-4a74-bdd0-3dfa15c16de5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181079,"FileName":"fbd55c6c-4d8f-4f0b-ab3d-e89cada2bd6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181079,"FileName":"463f9ced-fa3a-4e5f-97e6-088864a6fa96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181079,"FileName":"a110d475-5645-4ab6-a005-1f1b5b3bda4b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188742,"Name":"The Peeping","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Zenryutsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188742,"FileName":"d24397e7-9a5e-492f-9eb5-c8dd3227aa80.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188742,"FileName":"0f48500d-5b2b-49c2-8036-1ee46f85a579.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188742,"FileName":"f7c8d651-eea8-4b56-985a-9238f240bd77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188742,"FileName":"fe3b59d4-5bd0-42fe-94ee-30e9e3848821.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181103,"Name":"The Quest","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"A dragon is terrorizing the kingdom of Balema, and King Galt send his champion, named Gorn, to solve the problem.

The player controls the king as he explores vast outdoor and indoor environments. While some locations are simple side-scrolling areas, others are built like large mazes with platforming segments - the king has to jump on platforms to access certain areas or avoid enemy attacks; however, he doesn't take falling damage. Enemies respawn after the protagonist leaves the screen and returns. The king shoots energy orbs at the enemies; their type can be changed and upgraded as the game advances.\n\nThe role-playing element is present in levels and character development. Enemies leave two kinds of power-ups upon defeat: life-restoring and force-increasing, the latter being roughly equivalent to experience points. Leveling up occurs after accumulating certain amounts of these power-ups, increasing the main character's hit points. It is often required to level up in order to be able to access areas with harder enemies or defeat bosses.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCmQ8eCT4VA","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Bothtec","Publisher":"Bothtec","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":144232,"FileName":"39514e92-76fc-4e77-8e05-33e6973bfbde.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":144232,"FileName":"3a633b02-de5c-4931-b906-bd9533373494.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":144232,"FileName":"d9d260c8-7026-4145-b3d8-e92091ef4441.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":144232,"FileName":"5ca7e910-7777-466c-87b8-9f6fb319e5af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":144232,"FileName":"84e15fb6-b64a-416b-81c4-60c3a806af43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181044,"Name":"The Screamer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Screamer is set in a dark futuristic environment.

But recently, disturbances within BIAS have been reported. Apparently, dangerous creatures have gone rampant. Nobody dares to venture inside - except, naturally, the protagonist of this game...\n\nThe game is a somewhat unusual mixture of first-person dungeon crawler and side-scrolling action. Following a simple character creation, the player is taken to the Beast City, where it is possible to rest, buy equipment for the hero, and hear the latest gossip. Afterwards, the player can venture into the depths of BIAS, which is a huge maze-like dungeon. Enemies attack randomly; however, instead of the usual turn-based battle screen, the hero and the enemy are taken to a small side-scrolling area.\n\nAt that point, the game plays similarly to a side-scrolling shooter: the hero can jump, duck, and shoot at the enemies in real time. Due to the RPG nature of the game, the outcome of the battle depends on the hero's level as well as the player's dexterity.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"MagicalZoo","Publisher":"MagicalZoo","ReleaseDate":"1985-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":181044,"FileName":"59f68c92-36f3-4377-8529-d416c592334e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181044,"FileName":"8e08d177-822b-4e41-a6a5-8a1f7acaf080.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181044,"FileName":"adb0564e-622b-42b2-9e07-5663d7915695.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190141,"Name":"The Stone of Agni","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/jygdlOrlyc8","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190141,"FileName":"20f286f4-f69d-43c3-8bf0-137e9382b08a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190141,"FileName":"fac7d204-a41d-4245-84a6-0a4bedd17ec3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190141,"FileName":"1de0aa59-8e42-403e-bedd-8c7abfe83d84.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190141,"FileName":"1153a049-7e1c-4814-80e4-dd64332036a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188683,"Name":"The Story of Melroon","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"The story of Melroon is quite simple and similar to a fairy tale: the old king of Melroon has a 19-year-old daughter, and it's time to choose a husband for her.

The player assumes the control over one of the princes, trying to fulfill this request and embrace the sweet burden of matrimony.\n\nThe Story of Melroon is similar to older Zelda games in that most of the gameplay takes place in top-down, somewhat maze-like areas (mostly outdoor), with enemies wandering around, who must be fought in real-time combat. The hero can visit friendly areas (that use a side-scrolling view), enter houses, buy items and weapons.

A lone warrior named Tritorn is the only one who can defeat the demon and restore peace.\n\nTriton is, together with Dragon Slayer and Hydlide, an early progenitor of the action role-playing genre. Similarly to Xanadu, exploration is performed from a side view, with jumping and vertical areas, but no true platforming. Unlike the aforementioned games, it is necessary to press the action key to hit enemies rather than simply \"bumping\" into them.\n\nThe gameplay system is very simple, having no weapon or equipment management, monetary system, or friendly areas. The protagonist either attacks enemies with his sword or throws magic balls at them, which come in limited supply. Experience points are awarded for slaying enemies; though there is no clear indicator as to when the player character levels up, he gradually becomes stronger, tougher, and learns new abilities (e.g. walking faster).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sein-Soft","Publisher":"Sein-Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188699,"FileName":"8c91d514-26d8-4728-bff4-4a6c39460368.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188699,"FileName":"09e8093d-da54-4654-946a-b309b7836d7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188699,"FileName":"63a2c6e8-8d97-447d-9e7d-3d9ce6ea03d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188699,"FileName":"b54a4006-8ff4-445b-bf29-0711603fd204.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188700,"Name":"Triton II: Road of Darkness","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Once again, demons are threatening the peaceful existence of the human kind. The evil Geld is sending his army to conquer human lands. Legend says that the ancient city of Seram harbors a mysterious jewel that is needed to defeat Geld. But who is brave enough to venture there and retrieve it?\n\nThe follow-up to Triton is, like its predecessor, an action role-playing game. It expands upon the previous game by adding friendly areas (towns), monetary system, shops that sell items, magic spells, weapons, and armor, and non-player characters to interact with.

We get and invitation to Okiko birthday party. The person who finds her first is going to get a kiss, so a fierce competition among the invited guests ensues. The mansion is a maze with lots of traps laid about. The characters are carefully transferred from the anime so it's needed to know the original to get the most of fun. It's possible either to go the shortest way or to eliminate all the other competitors, so it can be considered multiple-branch story. The ending also depends on how other characters are dealt with so it's multiple endings as well. The system is command selection, but the number of commands is quite large, so the difficulty level is really high. In the early visual novels years lots of works were clinging desperately to the popularity of anime franchises, but this work is really well done and it shows how a game can be better in many elements than the original anime.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":"1987-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186818,"FileName":"d1991c81-c23b-4dfa-84ce-703e087642b2.jpg","Type":"Box -

But the island nation of Seljild, led by demonic warlocks, began to conquer one Ellzerian city after another. To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.\n\nVain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Glodia","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188712,"FileName":"1f499bc9-4c01-4574-8d19-b434a517135a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188712,"FileName":"87089ce9-467a-40ef-bd91-e0d6ece4bc46.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190151,"Name":"Val Trad","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/nWiofKvV3Sw","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","Publisher":"Union Planning","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190151,"FileName":"339b271f-4d78-4aad-9eca-03d963baec4c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":190151,"FileName":"f983c654-e9b2-4d60-90a7-84dd71168b37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190151,"FileName":"ff2887bf-2681-413a-898e-44d56b751a48.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189666,"Name":"Valna","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"System Sacom","Publisher":"System Sacom","ReleaseDate":"1989-05-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189666,"FileName":"5064fbf6-3f46-49d2-9c5a-9a7a84a85208.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189666,"FileName":"a653b32e-1c9b-4f2c-925f-b9329e7e89a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189666,"FileName":"0f69d9ff-234d-49c0-be55-1d0a1938a406.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189666,"FileName":"40fb9673-cd00-4e9c-aea4-ca622691cc0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189666,"FileName":"beb65f35-4b74-44d4-aae5-86c5b9d1504b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189928,"Name":"Vaxol","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Vaxol is best described as a Space Harrier look-alike.

In Wibarm, the player controls a transformable mecha robot that can shift between walking mode, a tank, and a flying jet.

In the prequel the fights were happening on a narrow black line with two small characters - this time there is a full battle screen and animation is much better. The scene of transformation to wingman was especially impressive since it has \"Ching!\" real voice cry coming out and there have not been voiced games yet. There seems to be only two battles in the game though compared to four in the original.

Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the \"Maelstrom\" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.\n\nWizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188720,"FileName":"35c7553e-4022-4751-870d-8494e28b7f55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188717,"Name":"Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get the staff back along with Gnilda's blessing.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188717,"FileName":"26f31d52-b0b4-4ac1-a709-8a8d7245189a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188718,"Name":"Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.\n\nLegacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.\n\nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188718,"FileName":"517eded7-9e71-46cb-a3be-21f0f07ca48e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188716,"Name":"Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188716,"FileName":"751c7e92-3cfe-42ad-a681-4f49d1912e17.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188716,"FileName":"3fd0b6b1-e16d-4cd5-88c9-5a1a20411d62.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188716,"FileName":"932d5e56-3525-45ed-9ec4-ed2ba1fa83ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188719,"Name":"Wizardry: The Return of Werdna","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The fourth game in the Wizardry series, The Return of Werdna takes a decidedly different approach from all the games that preceded it.

Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion.

There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\n\nMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food.

The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on.

Adol Christin and his friend Dogi are on a journey. Passing through a town, they find a gypsy caravan and Dogi has his fortune told. The fortune teller's crystal ball explodes and both Adol and Dogi decide to go to Dogi's hometown of Redmont. On the way to Redmont, the pair chance upon a wildcat that attacks them, saving Dogi's childhood friend, Elena Stoddart, in the process. Upon arriving, they learn that the townspeople are being threatened by men from nearby Valestein Castle. Always ready for adventure, Adol decides to assume the task of helping them out.\n\nTravelling to Tigray Quarry, Adol discovers that there has been a cave in, and monsters have taken over the quarry. Adol travels deep inside the quarry to rescue Edgar, the mayor of Redmont. After defeating the boss of the Quarry, Ellefale, and claiming the first statue, Adol finds Chester (brother of Elena) threatening Edgar. Adol pulls Edgar back out to the entrance of the quarry and goes back to Redmont. Meeting Elena (formally this time), Adol learns that some statues are being sought by Lord MacGuire, the King of Felghana province (where the game takes place). Another statue is being sought in the Illsburn Ruins, so Adol travels there to retrieve it. Another townsperson, Father Pierre, has gone there as well. Adol gets to an altar of sorts, where he overhears Chester talking with Pierre. After a brief duel with Chester, Adol is caught, and tells Chester that Elena is worried about him. With Lord MacGuire watching, Chester rebuffs Adol and kicks him down into a pit of lava. Battling through monsters, Adol finds a fire dragon, Gilan, and defeats him. The reward gets Adol over a large river of lava by solidifying it. After escaping from the pit, Ellena meets Adol at the top of a staircase. She informs him that the statue is indeed hidden further on. He opens a hidden door and fights a Wyvern, claiming the second statue.\n\nUpon coming back to the town, Adol meets up with Dogi, who informs him that he is heading off to the mountains and that Edgar wishes to see Adol. Adol meets with Edgar, who informs him that men from Valestein (Ballacetine in the SNES version) Castle are actively seeking the statues. He informs Adol of a statue in Tigray Quarry. Adol proceeds to the quarry and defeats the monster guarding the third statue. Adol then heads back to Redmont to inform Edgar. Upon arriving at Edgar's house, he interrupts a conversation between Edgar, Lord MacGuire and Bishop Garland about Galbalan. Galbalan, according to Edgar, is a demon of tremendous power who used to rule over the populace of Felgana a long time ago. He was sealed away by a hero using the four statues. Adol is sent to the Eldarm Mountains to chat with the hermit living there. Adol finds Dogi chatting with the Master up on the mountain. The Master tells Adol that a statue is indeed in the mountains, but inaccessible due to a statue that guards the entrance. Adol travels up the mountain to the peak and defeats a Harpy, gaining the staff that opens the way to the statue. He defeats the guardian Dragon, and claims the fourth and final statue. Chester show up, and tries to force Adol to hand over the four statues. A cave in interrupts the conversation, and Dogi digs the two men out. Chester is reunited with Dogi, and they converse briefly. Adol and Dogi leave for town, and find it almost deserted, with Mr. Gardner, the town guard, nowhere to be found. Inside the walls, they find Mr. Gardner and some of the townsfolk. Apparently, while Adol and Dogi were in the mountains, soldiers from Valestein Castle came to the town and kidnapped townsfolk in exchange for the statues. Adol converses with Edgar before setting out for the castle.\n\nAt Valestein Castle, Adol fights his way down to the dungeons where he finds the townspeople and Father Pierre. He tells Pierre to get the people out of the castle, and goes to find Lord MacGuire. On the way to Lord MacGuire's chambers, he comes across Bishop Garland, who taunts Adol. Garland then reveals himself, and Adol defeats him after a lengthy battle. Upon reaching Lord MacGuire, Adol finds that Lord MacGuire is repentant, and is sorry for his actions. He will make reparations for his actions. As Adol goes back across a bridge, he is met by Elena, who congratulates him on beating the soldiers and being a hero. Galbalan, who has reawoken due to the seal of the statues being broken, kidnaps Elena in midair and taunts Adol, telling him to bring the statues to his island fortress. Adol goes back to town, doubting himself. Edgar and Dogi bring Adol back to his senses, and Adol sets off to rescue Elena. Surviving many challenges, Adol comes to a platform where Ellena and Chester are talking to each other. Galbalan taunts Chester just as Adol arrives. Adol promises the statues to Galbalan, if he will not harm Chester or Elena. Galbalan agrees, and pulls Adol up to his realm. Adol fights and defeats Galbalan, and rescues Elena.\n\nAdol finds out that Chester has gone to the very center of Galbalan's Island, to seal it away. Ellena tells Adol that her village and its people are descendants of the man who sealed away Galbalan the first time. Only Chester knows how to sink Galbalan's island, and Adol must not interfere. Adol understands and he and Elena leave the sinking island. The scene shifts to Chester, who is manipulating crystals to sink the island for good. He tells Adol to take care of Elena for him, before sacrificing himself to destroy the island. The island then disappears for good.\n\nBack in Redmont, Adol and Dogi are at the Inn getting ready to leave. Dogi tells Adol to go on ahead, as he has something to take care of. They are leaving in the early morning as to not cause a stir within the community. Dogi is chatting with Ellena, who is in love with Adol. Dogi leaves, and Ellena almost stays. She then walks out of the Inn. Mr. Gardner is asking Adol what he and Dogi are planning. Mr. Gardner would like Adol and Dogi to stay, but Adol wants to have more adventures. He and Dogi leave, and as they are walking along the shore, Ellena runs up and shouts to them. Both Dogi and Adol wave goodbye. Elena cries as text scrolls telling about further adventures waiting for Adol and Dogi.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGVkHMWC-1o","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1989-07-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":159844,"FileName":"1c46f7c1-a2fd-4c28-8b9f-e707e36eff13.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":159844,"FileName":"381674e8-760f-4309-a16a-4c4d339ebb34.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159844,"FileName":"2f709a68-cde2-4e52-96be-72073bf26bde.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159844,"FileName":"eaf20258-2886-4328-8926-fead0664cba2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159844,"FileName":"ddd28e82-039b-4842-b243-aadae3b2f6c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":159844,"AlternateName":"Ys III","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":159831,"Name":"YS: Ancient Ys Vanished","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ancient Land of Ys...

Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188733,"FileName":"09ba71e7-b3b4-4dcc-b3e7-93f4e50d9bb0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188733,"FileName":"b835ee02-9e6e-428c-9327-a67a037ece28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188733,"FileName":"60ca342d-3863-4ae3-85f4-d1da43186fee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188733,"FileName":"d2fe8487-4b14-4451-913d-95b109184130.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181050,"Name":"Zarth","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"In the 21th century, powerful computer systems were invented.

Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.\n\nSimilarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Glodia","Publisher":"Popcom Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181049,"FileName":"00a2c551-93f1-4b0e-b7bd-991e26c42213.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200167,"Name":"Zaxus","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/Bzp8pc69sTs","Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Miyata Soft","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":200167,"FileName":"44e0f847-791c-42ae-b02c-1124aa1f42c2.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":200167,"FileName":"1dc7e03a-88b0-49fa-baa8-786020a67441.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":200167,"FileName":"313c93e0-103c-4df4-98f7-c350b17a5ca0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200167,"FileName":"9bca0fc8-76b3-49c3-aeda-90d5e5cab409.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181051,"Name":"Zeliard","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The ancient demon Jashiin has slept for two thousand years. When he awakens, he directs his wrath towards the kingdom of Zeliard, whose rulers of yore have allegedly harmed him. For 115 days, a sand rain devastates the kingdom, turning it into a desert. To complete his cruel revenge, Jashiin turns Felicia, the princess of Zeliard, into a stone. The valiant Duke Garland sets out on a quest to vanquish the demon and restore the princess to her true form. To do that, he must collect the Nine Tears of Esmesanti, which alone can reverse the terrible curse.\n\nZeliard is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and role-playing elements. The game world is divided into hostile labyrinths, which occupy its largest portion and contain maze-like passages for Duke Garland to traverse, as well as enemies that must be dealt with. Crests and keys must often be collected in order to ensure the progress to the next area. Garland takes damage from enemy attacks as well as the environment (hidden spikes, high temperature, etc.), but suffers no damage should he fall off a platform.\n\nThe hero uses his sword to combat the enemies, and shield to defend himself. He can also learn and cast projectile offensive magic. Special items can restore his health, increase the damage inflicted with the sword, grant additional protection, etc. Various types of clothes can be equipped; these can bestow the hero with further enhancements and immunities, such as prevent him from slipping on ice, allow him to jump higher, etc.\n\nThe Duke will visit different towns during his journey. In these towns, he can rest, replenishing his health, purchase and repair weapons and armor, acquire potions, and learn magic spells. Currency is obtained by exchanging enemy spirits for gold in banks. These spirits (called \"almas\") also serve as experience points: after the player has obtained a sufficient amount of them, the protagonist receives upgrades to his health and magic points from a local town sage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC PC-8801","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181051,"FileName":"b67ff1cb-8394-4a51-8746-6c98d4391500.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":181051,"FileName":"fdf45b87-365c-470b-aa6b-0764dc14196b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181051,"FileName":"94a9172f-1071-477b-80d7-5265096a3452.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181051,"FileName":"5addd725-3e0c-4364-b314-b6268d06019b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188734,"Name":"Zoom in Space","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Zoom in Space is a simple arcade-style shooting game whose pseudo-3D perspective and ship designs are both modeled after Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom.
