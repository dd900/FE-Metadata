Since handing it over to the terrorist is not what the government is planning to do, it sends you, the famous special agent Solid Snake, to rescue the senator and to find out who is really behind the hijacking.\n\n\"Metal Gear Acid\" is set in the familiar Metal Gear universe and graphically resembles the PS2 titles of the series, but its gameplay is quite different from that of the other games. \"Metal Gear Acid\" combines the traditional stealth gameplay with strategy. It is a turn-based game in which you plan your turns by selecting playing cards that are available in your card deck. Each card represents an action: attacking, moving, etc. You must plan your actions carefully to stay unnoticed and also plan ahead which cards you'd want to keep during the next round, and which you are ready to sacrifice in order to make an efficient move immediately.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KR2pfqpj7vo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Acid"},"69":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Goku Makai-Mura","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tose Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"26d30b89-eb02-4067-bff9-6da63d38cadc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ea8fef5d-9b3e-4cfb-a470-29062867b54f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0823aabf-051d-4920-bd72-1ffa0c2419fa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"47f3e715-d10b-49e4-a032-0a39984f6c1a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bc001550-e098-478e-9ffe-dfe0f9408163.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3efc9dc5-aba9-45da-b3c2-a18f497149ee.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b0d86981-d9b6-4677-bae5-ff249e062c4e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e93104c0-8e1e-4b6b-ae91-ee7dba4e4ad9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"87483b25-7980-410e-8b2d-908264a9588e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"61452626-e5ef-4651-a237-6cb4faa45b96.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"45785bcd-05c5-479f-be1c-de2a922722b4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e33274b2-4c7b-4ff5-9d72-03788093587f.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"2191f397-2406-4de9-83a8-88d613796784.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5bd536dd-a5ca-4761-bc24-6d7e64437639.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins","Overview":"An exclusive PSP edition of Capcom's legendary platforming game, directed by the original's creator Tokurou Fujiwara.

The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior in the service of the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused the remaining gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus. God of War: Chains of Olympus is chronologically the second chapter in the series, which focuses on vengeance as its central theme.\n\nChains of Olympus is a prequel set ten years before the original God of War. Gameplay is similar to the predecessors but with some minor changes. Kratos goes through levels killing enemies and bosses, solving box-based puzzles and doing quick time events. He also collects red orbs to power up his weapons and abilities, Gorgon eyeballs to increase his health and Phoenix feathers to increase his magic power.\n\nThe game's controls were adjusted to fit the PSP's reduced amount of buttons. Both the shoulder buttons and the analog stick are now required in order to dodge. The most well-known God of War weapon, the Blades of Chaos, are also present. There are several new weapons and magic spells available, including Sun Shield, Efreet spell and Light of Dawn. The game starts when the Gods send Kratos to the city of Attica to defend it from the invading Persian army. But later when Morpheus strikes, Kratos will need to use all his power to save the world once again.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2008-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SXZUGdkEwFo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/God_of_War:_Chains_of_Olympus"},"550":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"The 3rd Birthday (Twisted Edition)","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HexaDrive","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9aa80805-9ba8-4499-a3ad-039acc1e1649.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"72d56fed-287d-4322-ae11-2b5517127918.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"39b1ea70-200c-4af7-838d-c878ec0550b0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"54145d2d-2c88-4f72-9674-a80533f17beb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"81fa74d5-e629-4fd6-8c8d-55dfe282483f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15c4ff97-2947-4797-869b-de1257bd6b2a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3784376a-58e2-4ae4-80ce-41b51c0c08b4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9c4a953f-0999-4dfc-bce6-69b9f765d30f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"71b23f0c-0770-4600-9f6a-662c38d87c94.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7ce38725-880d-4355-8d98-182a74ab8e58.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0bb6f760-ec8a-45b1-90a0-fafaaca67614.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"39c2abf3-0a0d-47a8-8747-f7fcafa18a77.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b0dc7a42-cd99-4ebc-aa7c-7352f5eb4040.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dc489589-84e1-436c-adbd-4a61cca4be29.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"edbb0b1b-ac69-412d-b45c-5419c07276dd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c889d1a1-2e73-4c0c-b145-5398c1cd6129.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"62610306-359b-47ec-978b-75b9da1c4c21.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2d6d50aa-6740-4a04-aba1-999e6778636e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The 3rd Birthday","Overview":"Hideous creatures descend on Manhattan.

Players are also able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.\n\nElite Squadron features \"Heroes and Villains\" gameplay.\nIt includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called \"a huge step up from previous story modes\", and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Wars_Battlefront:_Elite_Squadron"},"1285":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition"},{"Name":"Final Fantasy: 20th Anniversary Edition","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square Enix","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"9cabd0aa-0ac5-418f-befb-1401199f5b5b.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f481e72b-0cb0-47e1-b067-860ebd79f395.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"81afa305-4754-45c2-a2ce-fe0e60f17ec5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"01355524-bcaf-4f36-a09b-4b2153616a4a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"047f356d-9702-454b-bf43-433316533994.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bf226a93-0d60-49da-84f5-128cd0843828.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dde029dc-7431-4392-b6a1-92ca7dc0258e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97960014-c8e5-4b30-96fb-28788eadfd13.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97c6206b-a45b-4da5-a066-f53e05502c89.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7222bdd4-01ed-4cf7-b3c9-884638c0e2e1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7e2586a9-d13b-4062-ae56-92a2fab4af66.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8ca0e18f-d595-488a-bca5-bda08c68d386.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2ca43cc3-ca2c-4711-b5fe-4ae3915d727f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e076146a-3211-4e72-9f01-412adf866a1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"de0b6236-a2b8-4a50-8fe1-6aeaec109e0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Final Fantasy","Overview":"An evil shroud covers the world in darkness.

Snake has been captured and imprisoned in an abandoned missile silo in Colombia, and with no support this time. At least, not at first. With the help of a fellow prisoner, Snake escapes and the game truly begins.\n\nPortable Ops is a classic Metal Gear game in almost every sense. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played previous console entries in the series. Snake can peek around corners, sneak up behind guards... they even carried over CQC (Close Quarters Combat) from Snake Eater.\n\nWhat really sets Portable Ops apart (aside from being on the PSP) is the pacing, and a few changes to the gameplay mechanics. The game is played out in missions, which are specific to certain areas. Most of the areas are not that large, which sometimes means seeing \"Mission Complete\" in only a matter of minutes. The ability to play through the game in segments really lends itself to the handheld format. If you only have five minutes, choose a quick mission, knock it out, save and you are done. Being able to return to each area whenever you want to procure more supplies means that even once you finish your mission, you will be coming back.\n\nGathering supplies is also essential due to the main new mechanic found in Portable Ops: recruiting. While Snake starts out on his own, he can enlist disgruntled guards, frustrated technicians, stubborn doctors and more. These soldiers can be used in your \"Sneaking Unit\" (the team you take into battle for each mission), or in one of the many support units, with certain soldiers having a more natural talent for certain areas. If you put someone who has medical bonuses in your Medical unit, they can produce rations, help your troops recover faster between missions and more. Technicians can create new items for your team, and Spies can steal ammo and give you intel on specific maps, which can open up new side missions or allow you to grab some heavy weaponry.\n\nMissions themselves range from recon to rescue to demolitions and beyond. You can only take four troops into a mission, and usually one of them has to be Snake. However, you don't have to always use Snake during the mission, he just has to be present. You can only control one character at a time, while the rest of the team hides safely inside boxes (usually right by the entry point). On the field, the soldier you use can make a big difference. Many times you can totally bypass a building's defenses just by playing as a guard. If you do not do anything to draw attention to yourself, you can oftentimes walk right past the enemy, plant some TNT, and walk away.\n\nSeveral soldiers even have special abilities that come in handy during a mission, such as being able to transfer extra items you pick up directly to your truck (each character is limited to four inventory slots), or drag unconscious enemies twice as fast.\n\nThe game supports multiplayer for up to six player simultaneously, over WiFi Ad Hoc and Infrastructure, with game modes such as Team Death Match, Death Match and Capture Mission.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2006-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oPr2Zk4FTBY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Solid:_Portable_Ops"},"3927":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kojima Productions","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"a7bea860-3734-497e-a363-70f2ec455357.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e1614e59-aa23-49f3-839e-08a692e4ffe2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f2c99459-a423-4ead-9660-63f79909b778.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eb8298c3-5d09-425a-ba15-5dcd34636460.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b1f1f0fe-5f30-422c-bb56-99595e649d7b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9e604dd3-f0e7-436f-9be6-138e5288e146.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa84f2d1-0edc-4f78-afde-fb3acf2aad59.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92032676-3b40-4079-9881-24017da762da.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0146cfbf-94ce-41e0-8529-17496fb84a6a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef4c84e1-2183-4fb5-aa5d-81a895c40189.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1ea62d7d-1a56-4f9d-8a94-6a6604a849e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9a60655e-313c-43e2-bf4a-e7fad5098e08.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1c659b39-f4ec-42e3-8b95-7df42a810c11.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4022c319-b8f8-438b-b6b5-2f5278400d09.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e852ea67-1dd4-443e-bfe3-b877b96ca556.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"95954bd6-f81d-47a5-ace3-c10858063d25.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a675d5e2-59cd-40e6-913b-515065a92f22.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker","Overview":"After the events of the third Metal Gear Solid game, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake isolates himself from the United States and sets up home in Colombia. Here, he creates Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers without Borders), a private military group that provides support for countries in need. Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker's story will explain the events which lead to Militaires Sans Frontières becoming Outer Heaven in later games and also see him finally accepting his role as Big Boss. Snake is still struggling with the guilt over the murder of a person who was very close to him.\n\nOne day, Snake is introduced to Ramón Gálvez, a peace teacher, and his student, Paz Ortega. The two want to ask for Militaires Sans Frontières hand in helping the country of Costa Rica. Recently, an unknown armed force with high-tech weapons has been creating trouble around the country and because Costa Rica's constitution forbids a military army there's nothing anybody can do about it. Snake at first refuses to help, believing that it may cause more tension in Latin America, which many believe is the centerpiece of maintaining power in the East and West. But after being presented a tape recorder by Gálvez which accidentally recorded a conversation between two women, Snake agrees, believing that one of the voices on the tape belongs to The Boss herself. Snake then sets out on a journey, a journey to not only bring peace back to the land of Costa Rica, but also bring peace upon himself.\n\nPeace Walker is set between the events of Snake Eater and the original Metal Gear. Snake is controlled via the analog stick and the rest of the buttons vary depending on the type of button configuration you choose; shooter type, action type, or hunter type. Gameplay consists of that usually seen in the Metal Gear series, which is stealth-base movement. That doesn't mean you always have to be stealthy though, if you want you can just let go and shoot up your enemies with different weapons ranging from the M16A1 to a Stun Rod. Cutscenes are presented in an artistic comic book style similar to that of Portable Ops, with some being interactive.\n\nNear the start of the game you will be given a central mother base to use for a number of different things. It is here where you can save your game, develop weapons, and embark on quests. At the Mission Selector screen you can replay previous missions to gain a higher score and also participate in extra ones not necessary to the main story. Cutscenes in which you have watched throughout the main campaign can be seen once again. Developing and upgrading weapons is done by spending currency known as GMP in which you obtain doing quests. At Mother Base you will be able to assign your MSF staff into different teams depending on their abilities and skills. Putting the right people in the right place will open up more opportunities to develop more items and weapons.\n\nMultiplayer in the game is limited to ad-hoc mode and co-op. All story missions can be played with up to two people and the other co-op missions with four people. After completing certain missions and meeting certain requirements, Snake will be able to head to an island where you and some friends can engage in hunts against monsters from Capcom's Monster Hunter series.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mlpH_I4DTLk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Solid:_Peace_Walker"},"5692":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Epyx, Inc.","Genres":"Action; Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"fe427e46-80fb-4c9c-a7ee-68aff135cc32.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"e710cc15-25c2-4083-9f02-f8e21c824e03.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d504ba2f-f891-4fc3-a902-82deff810099.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"34625a30-adff-4027-a58f-d370153caa7d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"51ea1f8c-97d2-400f-ad5c-1695a2b01f68.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a4133e78-5329-47f1-8481-52470778e2cb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"391dceac-c823-47e3-a809-1087cf3cadf2.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Impossible Mission","Overview":"In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.\n\nThe goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.\n\nThe 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a \"mixed\" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.","Publisher":"System 3","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-31T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"5969":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Patapon 1","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Music; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"9bb2d93d-7811-4d8f-8c97-98a46e4cf322.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4e651dd0-9609-4780-b47b-d1a52bc9d3fb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"497be73c-411e-4b3b-acf9-76a5e752df1a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ea398154-d3f4-44c2-b23b-8666f7d61c18.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"612d1449-1811-4b74-aced-59edac973d80.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5422dc7d-3a68-43fd-9cb5-e1ef2f0a9dd5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46e73f81-0a58-455b-b567-a352b7e68ff1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1a857d17-03d1-4057-9197-7a4cafaf163b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ffc1c3a6-0cef-4441-8863-58d60d78b3a0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0ce528e7-305b-4d89-9538-900ec82d2ccf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d35ee267-a73f-4e02-b314-5e8bfd14154e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"05b6772e-4666-47b0-825d-05bb32cd4b44.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f3a893bd-aadf-431b-bf37-10017b2ac772.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"754efce4-c29f-4761-bd59-601570d33f5d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7ff7c492-8564-4936-9d95-cc1887cbfc65.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Patapon","Overview":"The Patapon tribe were once an incredible force to be reckoned with, guided by their god, Almighty. No foe was too great, no treasure out of reach, as they searched for the fabled Earthend. However, these days are long gone, and the Patapons are now a shadow of their former selves. Take on the role of Almighty, and restore the Patapons to their former glory!\n\nPatapon is a hybrid of a rhythm game such as PaRappa the Rapper and a strategy game with unit management such as Advance Wars. Players control 'Almighty', the Patapons' god, as they guide them in search of Earthend. This is done with the Circle, X, Square and Triangle buttons - each button corresponds with a different type of drum beat. By pressing different sets of four beats, the Patapons will repeat the beat, and then perform the action, such as advancing, retreating or attacking. If the player continues to perform beats without messing up, they enter 'Fever' Mode, which makes the Patapons perform their actions stronger and faster.\n\nBy collecting assorted items, such as meat and wood, and spending Ka-ching (the game's currency) players can create new Patapon units at the Tree of Life. These units can then be prepared for battle before the player enters a stage, to give them better armor, shields, and weapons, which will help them fight more effectively against their foes.","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":"2008-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D4xkjTafCE4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Patapon"},"6461":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rebellion","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d4d47550-c094-43bd-8f2d-66e7e6f000a4.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9a3815fd-e327-4509-89f9-b378d3017bf5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fe3cef35-383e-4e0a-8d6f-2d4fd4b0c35c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"18894cf3-d9a0-4c09-98ed-da0483f71fb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"87be5783-76db-4daa-acb8-d0cd9e4522a6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1007fdd1-a073-437a-9900-c6c3d7e9cb7f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f3b5125a-d9e3-4856-a7c1-9e2735bbf402.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dbd9abdc-2d09-41c4-9aba-c4b8f02f5563.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem","Overview":"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem is based on the movie of the same name and continues the mix of the Aliens and Predator franchises. The basic premise of the movie is followed. Picking up where the original film left off, a group of predators travels back to the homeworld with a predalien, a survivor impregnated with an alien embryo. In a struggle to kill the creature that possesses the strengths and weaknesses of both species, the ship crashes on earth. A father and a son who investigate the vessel are impregnated by facehuggers allowing the aliens to continue their colonization of the planet. When a lone predator scout discovers the ship has crashed, he travels to earth to rid it of the intruders.\n\nPlayers take control of the predator from a third-person perspective. While the humans and aliens are fighting, his main task is to dissolve and disintegrate all evidence of extraterrestrial life. During the course of the game, the aliens are the main enemies, but humans will also engage the predator when he is sighted. The predator can activate a cloak, but this drains energy so it needs to be recharged every now and then by returning to the normal mode. The cloak automatically disappears when in contact with water. He also has three vision modes (tech, thermal and alien) to get a better look of the environment. Enemies can be locked to make it easier to track them while they are moving.\n\nThe shoulder buttons control the camera while the analogue stick is used to run around. Next to basic wrist attacks he also has additional weapons such as a shoulder cannon, hand cannon and a disc that can be thrown. The available weapons can be selected before starting a mission. These can be upgraded after completing missions. He can also zoom in (switching to a first-person mode) and tag aliens to earn honour points. These can be used to upgrade weapons and are also awarded when no humans are killed. Basic movement includes jumping, breaking through walls, climbing and shaking off aliens when pinned down as well. To progress, a certain amount of evidence usually needs to be removed first. The game offers branched missions paths with entirely different settings. While playing, a map can be activated to shown the environment, enemies and objectives.\n\nNext to the main storyline, there are skirmish matches that can be played with two players cooperatively as well.","Publisher":"Sierra","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SLAVcK7IAY8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aliens_vs._Predator:_Requiem_(video_game)"},"7068":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Saru Get You P!","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Ape Escape P","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony Japan Studio","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"1f1bf221-3ca5-48c9-8fa3-21ddbda8ca45.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"cb85609a-4aab-4059-b513-98eba7df4f43.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9497b172-1581-46b3-9557-74d12c269510.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f6e7fade-1657-4dbd-b5ea-42aab73dcdfe.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"330b4508-f6bd-4584-9dfc-7e274df64bc6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"459852fe-bf54-40c8-9704-864fd62f9edd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"99d4b9d1-6916-4008-9b9f-72f5115c272a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8219ba98-1dfb-45b7-863f-8901916815ea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"57fc49d5-85c4-418d-a8c3-dfe44a8ffa28.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a0adb7d1-aeea-4850-a823-a2e82dacb7b7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"33670770-cc19-4793-9922-0ea0ee8ee570.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ape Escape: On the Loose","Overview":"A remake of the first entry in the Ape Escape series, Ape Escape: On the Loose arrives on the PSP with multiplayer functionality and a variety of minigames.

Unlike the Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles spin-off for mobile and portable devices, it offers the open world and nonlinear gameplay of the original game.\n\nThe game is set one month after the events of the first game and takes place in the two cities Limassol and Kyrenia on the island of Cyprus. The Templars have moved there and Altaïr has followed them to find out what their plans are and to take all of them out if there is an opportunity. The main villain is Armand Bouchart, grand master of the Templars, who is hunting the apple of Eden, which will allow him to control the minds of anyone he chooses.\n\nGameplay runs on similar vein to the original Assasin's Creed. Altaïr has the ability move freely through each of the cities in the familiar parkour style based on stealth and sneaking up on targets. Players can also opt to have Altaïr simply fight his way in at street level and go in through the front door. Altaïr's arsenal consists of his fists for melee (usually non-lethal) combat, his signature sleeve sword and a longsword.\n\nBloodlines also features PS3 connectivity via USB, which allows you to unlock six new weapons in Assasin's Creed II when your PSP is hooked up to your PS3. These can also be used in the PSP version. In addition to this, any Templar coins you find in Bloodlines are carried over to Assassin's Creed II, and codex pages will give you a health boost.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Bloodlines"},"7071":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Stainless Games Ltd","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"124fe83f-902d-45ae-874b-43e9c456c6b4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"04904fe7-18d3-4ba1-a4e5-9c59c889f29c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ce5d5243-5cc9-4d53-9e85-04773e466c1f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56147a09-16da-473f-ba7d-feed8bd81071.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"30760a9d-4246-41b9-b7d2-3e313c70eb8e.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Atari Classics -Evolved-","Overview":"Atari Classics Evolved will feature such timeless games as Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest, Warlords and Pong.

Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.\nHumanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance.

Become a Sackperson, and dress them up as you wish with all sorts of gear that you come across in the game worlds. Explore the levels made by the Creator Curators, or create your own and send them to the world!\n\nLittleBigPlanet is a platform game based on the PlayStation 3 game of the same name. In it, you control a Sackperson, with the base goal of reaching the level exit. However, many physics-based objects and puzzles are encountered along the way. There are also many tricks, traps and enemies. Aside from being able to jump, your Sackperson can also hop between the two levels of depth (unlike the PlayStation 3 version, which features three levels) in the level to walk in front or behind objects, grab objects to push or pull them, or even hitch a ride on a tethered jetpack and fly about the area.\n\nA huge feature of LittleBigPlanet is the ability to create and share levels with millions of other players around the world. You can make your own levels with objects you've collected in the single player mode, and then use those objects to make anything you like - whether it be a platform level, action game, music box - anything! The level creator allows for a lot of freedom and also offers detailed tutorials on how to use and place objects, as well as tweak their variables. The PSP version of LittleBigPlanet is not able to play four player simultaneous multiplayer like the PS3 version - instead it is a single player only game.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3eGnjQEQJ2I","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/LittleBigPlanet_(2009_video_game)"},"7094":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f23f0a9b-48a4-4247-8dee-d0ff4d25c000.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"06e3385c-6678-4c1f-91c7-04a6b9bb2441.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bad680a6-8e99-4bbb-b410-f28fcebbbfbc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9fec0a22-3a1d-4dc3-9ce5-c43cb3b89ebd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"db1c5cf0-74c6-49fd-a3f9-816027ced5b6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c3b4227a-8b41-4461-a69c-a4fa05e2ed1f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d676659b-3342-4a16-8289-03572308fd34.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7f952c98-b222-45a8-a306-c337eac241c3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"391e26cf-15e8-4b45-87d0-df2a028cdb93.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"692b3452-1588-4f89-a6be-82794c363b1d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d9bdccc2-c254-419e-879f-8b11cbc64044.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4ab9da54-faf9-4421-abf0-de9c6c87a010.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c497e726-d953-445d-b168-fc9ae28d6973.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7fa72570-870c-47a1-9783-2b8f6b71749d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cc357dec-c2fe-4bf0-8e68-a8c369d45453.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2f140ca2-0244-4b2f-9801-694390abbc60.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"a94ca6bd-84da-4a88-a0e0-da5902af9ab8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e63b03df-d359-4a6d-bb84-c0743845e360.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"LocoRoco","Overview":"The blob-like LocoRoco are in trouble! A meteor has crash-landed on their planet, bringing with it the black, shaggy Moja Troop, who just happen to find that LocoRoco taste delicious. Soon, they're nearly all gone! It's up to you to take control of the planet using your PSP and repopulate it so that it's full of LocoRoco once more.\n\nLocoRoco is a unique game for the PSP that is very simple to pick up and play. The L and R Buttons tilt the game world to the left and right, causing the LocoRoco to roll in that direction, while pressing both L and R simultaneously makes the world bounce and causes the LocoRoco to jump.\n\nLocoRoco love to eat, and their favourite fruit is the red berries that are native to the planet. For each one of these that you eat, the LocoRoco grows bigger. It may in fact become too big to squeeze through smaller gaps, however this is not a problem. If you tap the Circle button, the LocoRoco will shriek and break up into smaller ones. If you hold the Circle button, they will all call out and assimilate back into the singular LocoRoco.\n\nThere are also little blue men called 'Mui Mui'. These folk are tucked away in the more hidden parts of the levels. Discover them, and they'll reward you with additional parts to build your own 'Loco House', as well as give you different music tracks to play in it. Your Loco House can be customised to your liking, and then you can watch as a LocoRoco explores it, and possibly earns you even more house parts. You can also share your Loco House with a friend.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z3xQtyce62o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/LocoRoco"},"7095":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Lumines: Oto to Hikari no Denshoku Puzzle","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Q Entertainment","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Music; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4f05f177-51e2-4227-afa1-7534f3cb06c4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"61579156-5300-404f-84b2-87adda6ba34b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bb6da751-49f2-471f-bf70-6c374a54fe66.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ce6dcecb-8954-4741-906b-5a0c5590840c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ebf1e62b-fc43-413b-8e9e-3537891adb22.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bed90464-11c7-498f-a408-c8c9bf5ffa53.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f1829b73-cdf7-4291-a24d-de7e1f24c2ba.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9a5593d-f033-4bf4-b819-7b53bc7be0a5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a0b232f-a7ca-4ba7-896c-4e162be4ee1a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"04377565-726c-4c13-88c3-3bb90fa48bde.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4673645b-be53-4641-94bb-f177f2034004.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"13675c5b-7c0d-44a9-8b8f-ce495348ce0c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e9e08892-44b6-4c4b-a184-c88c1f549314.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b2201e83-771e-4f75-ae81-119e50cab89a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"ac3d490b-a524-4155-a313-77201e1fb647.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Lumines: Puzzle Fusion","Overview":"Bust blocks, solve puzzles, and play wirelessly with your friends.

He doesn't know much about his past, but is well aware of his skills, as are his newly acquired companions. Returning back to the US from a mission well done, his only hope is that he'll start remembering his past as he steps on a friendly soil. But instead of having some time to do so, an FBI agent takes him and his friends into custody, leaving him with only one option to save his friends, and that is to help the agent with a mission of his own. Reluctant but left with little to ponder about, Snake agrees until he can connect some dots.\n\nUnlike the prior game, the game uses a 3D cell-shading technique making the game less realistic but more colorful, now spanning over 500 cards at your disposal. Gameplay is basically the same turn-based style as the original, though comes with certain enhancements like being able to undo your moves to a certain degree, or moving in real-time and not losing moves on opening doors or crouching. There is also a new type of cards that is self-triggered when you use other cards, usually enhancing your action in one way or another.\n\nThe Metal Gear Ac!d 2 package comes with a Solid Eye, a special type of 3D glasses (a cardboard box that slides over the PSP, not the blue-purple plastic but with lenses) to play the game with a 3D effect. You can also use it to watch various Snake Eater and other movies as you unlock them in the game, giving you the feeling of 3D space.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XEI45lxA1mA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Acid_2"},"7103":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kojima Productions","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"278539f0-0a0e-41ed-9db1-d6892263b002.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"719548b5-839f-4d83-b04c-f091ab6ec8ec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"db8bf7ee-4c93-4803-a0d6-bcf62b4cf541.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"497f5a94-7baa-464f-a7b7-7b625ab483cb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"48f9ae1e-8693-4277-bfc7-34910c913d35.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa297e27-6e44-4e20-a4f9-09209977f038.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f8c3f92e-d7de-40f7-9956-cc64740e6cd1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b0476960-f676-4f94-a346-518ff751cfa9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"55570fae-2f5b-4584-a94b-ef1bfe40fc90.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6f912491-2097-4f93-a9d2-ea8dfd59d59a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4367e688-39aa-4a2e-8008-e135a0a7f4fc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8a2b8fed-b653-4565-934a-c923b54a523a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d10335fc-85b0-4af7-9af8-767924ad2d8f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"aabde2b0-6c86-4bc7-930b-10eff9f525ec.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"9c18acd3-f92b-4bf6-bd8f-e1ee8e3ff137.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d0487671-dd9f-4bd5-876b-0856012d921d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus","Overview":"Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus is a standalone addition to last year's award winning stealth action title of the same name.

While a good deal of the game mirrors the Playstation 2 original, there have been a large number of additions. There are now more quests, more monsters, more weapons, more armor and more areas around town to use to your advantage.\n\nYou now have a farm that sits just outside of town. You'll have access to some mining veins, bug catching spots, a dock for catching fish and a garden. This means that now you can gather materials when you're between missions, which doesn't eliminate the need to gather things while on the hunt, but it does make it less of a hassle. Another extra area is the training school. Here you can partake in hunts with specific limitations; you have a specified item and equipment layout, and have to take on larger prey within a shorter time limit. It's tough to be sure, but it also opens up the ability to produce some very special and powerful new weapons.\n\nThere are some insanely difficult hunts you can take later in the game. As for the new creatures, they run the gamut from having added colors (with new armor options to match) to totally new monsters (like a battle-worn wyvern with a huge mean streak). As an added bonus, not only can you make new types of armor from these new critters, but you can (in some cases) make more armor from classic monsters.\n\nThe controls on the PSP are a little different. While the PSP does lack two shoulder buttons and a second analog stick, players just press two face buttons instead of swinging the right analog stick. Triangle, Circle, and Triangle and Circle combined unleash three different types of attacks, while holding the right shoulder button blocks (or charges to attack if you're using a hammer). Multiplayer is limited to Ad-Hoc, so no going online to form a hunting party.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2006-05-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monster_Hunter_Freedom"},"7106":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tantalus","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"8bf71af8-0393-4a19-ada9-b6f604d6a677.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"31f448d0-93a5-411b-b971-e7ef01f4dfc6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4167a28c-3c21-468f-a94c-17851f3f91ed.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"22d22ee6-b51c-4f22-847d-6272df16c481.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a1a124f9-ca45-497d-b668-8ce0d57c3a8e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ad0fc786-9a5f-4eca-8ca4-a91016ac013d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2b9dcd4e-71ce-418c-ad25-1db9ff601ae8.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"MX vs. ATV: Untamed","Overview":"MX vx.

Just like Need for Speed: Most Wanted, the game is centered around a career mode and Blacklist 15, where you need to work your way up a ranking by beating several racers. There is no storyline however, and the cutscenes have also been removed.\n\nProgress is achieved by completing several events (milestones). There are regular races, but also heat challenges where you need to get the cops off your tail, or break through roadblocks. You can try to outrun the cops, but the levels also contain pursuit breakers; special events that can slow down the chase. The PSP version adds new modes such as Tuner Takedown where you race as a cop and take down the street racers with a limited amount of time.

The Red Baron","Overview":"As Snoopy sleeps atop his doghouse, the player is transported into his dreams about the adventures of his alter ego, the \"World Famous WWI Flying Ace.\" The rest of the Peanuts characters are woven into his dream - and thereby the game's narrative - as they pass by the sleeping beagle. Lucy Van Pelt becomes the commander of the Allied forces, Linus and Sally take humorous turns as intelligence officers, while poor Charlie Brown is characteristically cast as a janitor in an Allied airbase. The story moves quickly after Charlie Brown is captured by the Red Baron's minions along with the plans for a secret weapon that could change the course of the war. Snoopy and his co-pilot Woodstock take to the skies in his trusty Sopwith Camel to recover the plans and rescue Snoopy’s hapless owner.\n\nThe game mechanics center around third-person action adventure flight in contexts such as aerial races, dogfighting missions, and world exploration. Collectible items in the world unlock plane and weapon upgrades, as well as new character\/plane combinations for use in versus multiplayer aerial combat. Hardcore Peanuts fans will recognize the front lines at Verdun, the woods of Montsec and Verdon Gorge as the settings for Snoopy’s original Flying Ace adventures in the comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. The game features 7 of these locations, which often change considerably from mission to mission.\n\nThe flight model for Snoopy's Sopwith Camel and the other planes in the game leans heavily towards the fanciful arcade end of the realism spectrum. Controls and collision are forgiving and approachable for younger players, although advanced stunts such as barrel rolls and Immelmans are accessible through button combos for experienced aficionados of the air combat genre. The game includes boss sequences that offer novel variations on its core mechanics. For example, players will battle a flotilla of submarines as Woodstock, being towed behind Snoopy's plane in a toy balsa-wood glider. Here the mechanics are those of a rail shooter, with Snoopy pulling the player along a path while the player contends with a multi-stage boss fight.\n\nPre-rendered cut scenes advance the narrative between missions as the player returns to a \"hub world\" represented by Charlie Brown's neighborhood. Here the player can upgrade his plane and weapons at Pig-Pen's Shop or complete a series of tutorials at Marcie's Flight School.

In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJi4N31URtY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wipeout_Pure"},"7124":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"World Tour Soccer: Challenge Edition","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SCEE Studio London","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3ac58664-4749-4784-bf2a-2562ca399ef0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"245239c3-83e5-4bcb-bf1e-5515c20548ca.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2f32a10-2130-4597-b3f6-1b01a8a26a90.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8271e16c-c551-4381-97ae-66a26b8b74aa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46058472-a9e2-4e50-b563-8f9fc781de87.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"91e09ccd-3719-4f96-8bc2-7e58678d8f48.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d90302e1-b2e9-4f93-a733-f8b92de87842.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a11f66aa-02da-458b-b9c9-12f81003f45c.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"World Tour Soccer","Overview":"World Tour Soccer: Challenge Edition (WTS; known simply as World Tour Soccer in the United States) is the PlayStation Portable version of the popular PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game This Is Football (TIF), created by SCEE's London Studio and released in 2005.\n\nWTS featured very similar gameplay as TIF but was not a direct port of its forerunner as a number of areas were enhanced - particularly the challenge mode referred to in its title.\n\nWTS has emulated TIF's success by selling over half a million copies in PAL territories.\n\nAs a result of its success, a sequel to WTS was developed by SCEE and released as World Tour Soccer 06 in 2006.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"8168":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Star Wars: El Poder de la Fuerza","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Krome Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"772454f0-cba1-4570-91e6-c149eb460822.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"363641b5-4ec5-4e5b-a72c-ffcc46bb1943.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"18c7cc24-9f51-42cd-a17e-eccadde33e60.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"99dab1bb-0638-4367-866e-c1cbb40d5519.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9f57316-0b01-4981-8a40-6502f4b4e677.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f0660af-5909-4141-adcf-98974182a6b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3bb79bb2-e40d-437d-9a84-33fbdbe6ce44.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dd6f4014-fa7b-4a68-a6c2-50bdcbd886f0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"880cc6d7-ac73-4d14-a056-6b862bc4cefc.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"a6179925-2ab8-4a9c-879e-35df63ff6ff1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d68c6668-9c2f-408a-af36-7e3940a826b4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fce47d94-9db1-4666-a639-118eb2650eb6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed","Overview":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed for the PSP is largely based off the PS2\/Wii versions, but includes separate Force Unleashed mode and different multiplayer modes.

With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations.

The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage.\n\nThe game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9303":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ace Combat X2: Joint Assault","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Project Aces","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Flight Simulator; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ce9efc47-e90f-43b3-a9c2-36edfc3ca9aa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"630efa96-dfbc-47f6-a7eb-e46624c6fece.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1497b4e2-80e5-4ce7-9bd7-f7ea10fd7062.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7a8e38a-4eb7-485a-b839-764c89883fad.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a1851998-2b54-4797-b681-091244ea89c0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d24537bf-2587-49ad-9f7d-8dc265d3405c.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"66fec96a-081a-4852-8778-5c2b9ad4d53b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"73f85847-a0ca-4242-a869-3d6c7c7e511c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d7498a75-21ee-4ddc-af46-d068ce7df93f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"13d92827-e1ef-4ce7-90e8-0b3c81d4bbda.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Ace Combat: Joint Assault","Overview":"Ace Combat: Joint Assault leaves the fictional worlds of previous Ace Combat installments and enters the real world. The missions take place over London, Tokyo and San Francisco, but still feature fictional elements like huge flying fortresses. The player takes the role of a young pilot who joins the private military force Martinez Security and soon has to fight the Valahia, some sort of bandits which threaten whole cities - but of course the plot soon becomes more complicated.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly identical to the PSP predecessor Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception. The player controls combat airplanes (either in third-person or from a cockpit view) and fights other airplanes (or other big flying enemies) while dodging their missiles. After finishing missions, which mostly consist of killing a certain number of enemies or boss fights, the player receives money which is reinvested into unlocking more airplanes or upgrades. These aircraft are based (and licensed from) real-life models and have certain advantages and disadvantages, e.g. some are more suitable against flying enemies while bombers are effective against ground targets. The mission tree is branching and the player has to choose between multiple missions at times.\n\nThe only major new features are the \"enhanced combat view\" (because modern air combat is usually fought over long distances, the game zooms in to give a nearer visual look at the enemies) and the co-op mode which allows to play the whole campaign with other players. Then the game takes advantage of the branching missions, meaning that the (up to four) players are divided into two teams. The other multiplayer modes are identical to Skies of Deception, except that they allow eight instead of four players to participate.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Partners","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9381":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"合金弹头XX","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"SNK Playmore","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0f1f9738-295d-4d65-b119-ac4ec17249fc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"51b51292-7a95-47d4-87be-720d2280e781.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"41f57eda-66fc-4394-b8e0-561e84e6d143.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ed536eec-5b5f-4d32-bf7a-2e5172e6baf9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"79e64f91-77b1-451b-aaef-12133f40ebd6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a8197f2b-ba33-49e3-b6ea-b2e80b3361bb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"06651efc-efa3-41f7-a781-83e78172df1b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94db3baa-f473-434f-a05b-5b7ba626026c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4591f3f-5599-4cec-9a02-2f56ba888388.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"654d7d98-2588-464d-b025-25fc60104e77.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b533c80c-2bad-4038-b995-d46159c3c095.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"08f6c601-9844-489a-b994-a8dea9fd8e17.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6b7d5d6c-8e6c-4a34-bf3e-d8df8e5df001.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"75b46420-e95a-4c01-8982-368c47cbc8e3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c5b35719-fc59-4143-8cbe-bb5f1835f862.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8ceeee36-2fdd-4181-9dec-89de42029f03.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"03e4a0a2-cec2-4282-85e3-73c6116d746e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fc2e3d1c-2d3d-4ae9-8f3c-6ddf01368c99.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"84ea966e-9d62-46c2-b6c9-809709bc0667.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"064d9de4-df67-4797-b8f1-2370ebcf1ed8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a0c7c26a-2841-42b0-8f96-f154448554d0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"899ba124-0bf0-4b81-bdfe-ca449a9dd0de.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"981b888a-bf8f-4154-bc92-1425c7ce48df.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0e0b7592-66c3-45d7-8a93-e6ca7fa0bb7a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"32a8bb08-69c6-435e-9ca6-5ebbc869c6cc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1fdfc6e5-915f-46e4-9e4c-9d70f261bdc0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Metal Slug XX","Overview":"Metal Slug XX is an entry in the long-running series of side-scrolling shooters.

The game's story loosely follows the plot of the movie, in which the four Ninja Turtles have grown apart and must now reunite to combat a new threat to New York. Images and clips (on the PSP only) from the film are used to illustrate the story between levels.\n\nThe game consists of 15 stages. In each, the player controls a specific turtle. The game is primarily a platformer, in which the turtles run and jump across rooftops and other environments to get to the end of the level. Jumping works by moving to a glowing hot spot and then pressing one of three buttons that launch a jump to the front, the left or the right (relative to the screen), corresponding to the goal spot. Jumps succeed automatically if the right button is used. Some situations where there are downward slides, ropes to swing on, or walls to climb require pressing a fourth button to charge the jump. Occasionally, another turtle will appear in a level and must be caught up to in a time limit. If successful, he hurls his brother further along the level which gains him a Family Bond. This can be used in the fight sequences of the game, which include fights against a number of goons as well as boss battles. In these, the turtles can use basic attacks, blocks, and various more powerful moves like a swing attack and a powerful charging move. The Family Bonds are used to summon another turtle for extra attacks.\n\nUpon completion of a level, the player is awarded medals for completing goals. These include finishing the level in a short time, collecting all four of the letters T-M-N-T, gaining the Family Bonds and performing jump chains. Chains are created if the hot spot jumps are performed in quick succession. Getting all gold medals in a level unlocks bonuses. Levels can be replayed to improve the performance.\n\nThe game also includes a multiplayer component, in which players race each other across a level to see who can get to the end the fastest.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LoOoS115Nko"},"12511":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rockstar Leeds","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"66059f04-dc69-4192-9a68-2edede28bdad.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5d06d031-0688-45b0-b16f-c5116cb1530e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"054cf710-d838-4899-92f2-fc7f3ac00654.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"93576be3-c09a-4988-b7aa-cbf062729667.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c923348d-eb73-452c-86cf-89f4e9b05e61.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bb31d8db-eba5-4d54-b0d4-1b15bb6c2c44.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6825ecea-a398-44c7-b739-fd8390589a2a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4b7fb31d-8f5e-446e-beaa-ccf59fd0c0f4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"54dbdfde-a309-43dc-80c6-f9d938473591.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1773e313-1e0e-4b3a-ad37-abb627af9508.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f09e59b6-3e47-4896-b914-64debe1bddd0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"83f3154a-80d8-4fb6-90dd-68a56aba6a71.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b33b2890-84cf-4319-8009-94a82de92421.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Warriors","Overview":"The Warriors is based on the 1979 gang film of the same name.

Despite the number 3 (as the third part of the Gagharv Trilogy), it is in fact a remake of the fifth title in the series, Umi no Oriuta. This part is a standalone story that takes place in the realm of Weltluna, which was once the center of an ancient civilization known as the Water Tribe, and the game closes the Gagharv trilogy. It draws upon a number of the conventions from the previous titles and provides 30-50 hours of gameplay.\n\nYou control Forto, who sets off on an adventure to locate a song left behind by a legendary composer. The game features an improved battle system, which allows you to change party members during battle. While you travel you will meet a variety of characters, of whom six will be able to join your party. The game also features an extra bonus if you have save data from either of the first two Legend of Heroes games on your memory card.\n\nFrom time to time, you will come across areas where you can teleport to a special section. There, you can team up with characters from the previous games and go on optional adventures for experience, money, and items - an addition that rewards players who have been following the series from the beginning.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"2007-01-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13046":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ken to Mahou to Gakuen Mono","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zerodiv","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"c84daf58-0a5c-4d78-9a76-c210a0cb7627.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1cf5b09d-9e82-4d44-abff-ca63df136cff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29ad0e8c-ba43-4a6b-bc2a-bdf220f0ff44.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"428a3aa2-ddd8-4fc8-a3ab-b1a36aae2262.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"219ebcf0-9c6c-458b-a652-548de3300b02.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"62853e6d-2074-44a0-8326-4c540579cc4c.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Class of Heroes","Overview":"Why did they appear?

Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors.\nAs original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2012-06-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VS__u7HRpmk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gungnir_(video_game)"},"13322":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Career Soft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"58ce9eef-6526-4b69-8926-4be680a2b9c3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3ee29ce7-f00c-4af6-8422-2bfd7a93dd93.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efcb29ed-4477-4c99-b91d-b3b8dc7e67d7.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7587b4a1-860e-48c3-b602-691ea1a925a6.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"33c0db2b-fa0b-4f6d-877a-eea9effc66a1.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a8bbd34f-c66c-4262-94fa-aba6bdbfc9a4.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"399d6378-dd3e-455b-95df-3554d824d04a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f5caca31-8dda-40ce-b0c3-1e622a488c16.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"6e0aeab9-4ed7-4034-9c7e-8ec27df3960a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Growlanser: Wayfarer of Time","Overview":"Never before released outside of Japan and widely considered the best entry in the long-running franchise, this PSP system iteration of the fourth chapter in the Growlanser saga delivers visuals remastered for PSP system's 16:9 widescreen, a vastly expanded script with tons of new characters to meet and quests to complete, a wealth of new ending possibilities, and much more, making it the first and only version of the game North American fans will ever want!","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JMTEKDYl75E","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Growlanser_Wayfarer_of_Time"},"13368":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"GameHouse","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"052f0d11-55e1-4b65-b882-5f26e96e5561.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"76eb09a3-d97a-47df-89bf-574deaf2b260.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e88efce-0ba2-43ef-a94b-12d205f49b23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6cf124f-187d-471a-9301-912f61e10955.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"882fbf85-6000-4e8a-bf0b-97c8130be0f5.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Super Collapse 3","Overview":"The third game in the Collapse! series has the same core gameplay as previous games but features several new modes including for the first time a quest mode.

More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen. To remove blocks the player simply clicks a group of three or more like coloured blocks. Some special pieces exists such as bombs that blows up surrounding blocks.\n\nIn the quest mode the player enters a strange world where he progresses from level to level. For each level that is completed a new is made available. The quest mode features a store where the player can purchase different things for the money he earns for completing each level. For more money it's also play different casino mini games such as slot machines. All of the game modes are available in the quest mode and after a number of them have been completed they become unlocked for the player to play at any time.\n\nThe relapse mode works like classic but new blocks come in from both top and bottom. In the strategy mode new block will only come in when the player clicks. In the puzzle mode the player has to clear all blocks from the screen and no new appear. In the slider mode the rows of blocks will slide left and right so that the groups changes. The continuous mode is an endless variant of the classic mode and the player has to last as long as possible. In the countdown mode the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes.","Publisher":"MumboJumbo, LLC","ReleaseDate":"2007-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13369":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Final Fantasy Tactics - Shishi Sensou","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Square Enix","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"b9696dc4-453d-4925-932c-5a42f863452d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5059c90d-9e16-4986-842c-5cecb220c949.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"46a476c0-ca57-4918-960f-1c60cd56b1d0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c06f16a5-d38a-45e6-b375-c980e993e365.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0baf98ba-f39c-45bb-9548-a50f5bc01e84.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e5f3ddb-512e-475d-9abe-357a67cedff7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5b3d6f5c-076c-46d3-9578-643132dcf7bd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3e15b53-e5c4-449f-a801-b687577ac2e5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"6b096ffd-db66-4ccf-9266-46266d41a571.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f622ed8e-27c8-460d-87ca-87834dc53b67.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"13fa0838-ccab-42cd-8e15-0f7a3ec7dbc5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f57083ed-cc9d-4465-919f-e7ec494df136.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9acee9bf-4c68-4e9d-ab41-3772a460ca21.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"22404486-8c90-4549-b557-c735b6375460.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"79b8dd4a-1e01-4548-bd6e-6027e36c1dd8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7026fac6-fca5-428d-9ff0-37cc1575e268.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a01f369f-a046-490b-b721-db9c1e12749c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b23d48da-607c-461f-b621-df79a2ae1295.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cb38c099-7361-436d-a7d3-96cb60b7b34d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d0c8ed2e-cf6d-4ab7-b60b-febaa92f1cfd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7d863c45-6fa9-4b1c-825f-87ec112ed6b6.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"4358abb2-ecb6-4cf2-bee1-8684614b25ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions","Overview":"Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.\n\nIn the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled \"guests\" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to nearly endless combinations.\n\nThe PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.\n\nAlso the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team mission).","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V9boE7AhybA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Final_Fantasy_Tactics:_The_War_of_the_Lions"},"13381":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ivolgamus","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"4d811a72-aa92-4575-9bdb-4349bc6c940a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d82b1f3f-206f-4596-a592-1780f40f18e4.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"908b998a-fed0-4590-9bea-55e3f6123e93.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f64c37b9-b98c-44a8-8891-12b8375a4187.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"da69b474-daa7-44fa-997a-dc00bc2a8121.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8bf9da49-52f1-4a2a-9faa-9b30cb5c6353.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8c562101-6dc3-460e-a1aa-fb038217d046.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6db4c6e9-f512-431d-adbd-0e88fe919cc1.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"888aa278-4604-4402-b5cc-1996950af2f6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4c6170df-5854-4d76-a6d8-4871db7fbb73.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fading Shadows","Overview":"Fading Shadows is a unique puzzle game for the PSP where the player leads an orb through 40 different levels by controlling a beam of light.

Players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO bricks, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart. Like its predecessor, the game puts a spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue.\n\nLEGO Star Wars II is a third-person action game with platforming elements. Players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the key events of the original movies with LEGO bricks. Each character has different weapons, like lightsabers for Jedi or crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, e.g. Jedi being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jetpack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve simple puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. Vehicle levels are more prominently featured than in the previous game, with longer sequences dedicated to piloting traditional Star Wars aircrafts.\n\nIn addition to a single-player game, there is also a co-op mode that allows two players to go through the Story Mode. In the single-player mode, the second character is controlled by the AI. Like in the first game, the Free-play mode allows players to go back and replay beaten levels with any playable character they have unlocked. A new feature allows players to create their own mixed-up LEGO characters and vehicles. Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for players to experiment with.","Publisher":"Lucasarts , TT Games","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XRZTJ35w9Sw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy"},"13554":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"STAR OCEAN: Second Evolution"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"tri-Ace","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"2b571d14-68f9-4ba7-b696-ac3d48042caa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0579d2a4-b9b4-4c01-888c-12a4d61e72af.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"21ba7663-c575-4254-b932-788f45ac799a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fb3dc27c-9688-40e8-a852-0916dc116427.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b10df3f3-8a80-4e7b-b46e-88b65186af6d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc9c53d1-b542-403f-a4b8-8fc4782c8d06.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01bb3fef-05ce-4c52-baa8-f7ceb4e6f9d3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"2ffb0224-6269-4713-b281-7fae56cb2dcb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bea09381-95e4-4ad8-8e1c-3652c3c85007.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d5159a94-1f89-45cd-86ea-4784f62707ea.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3621345e-fc70-4add-a81c-05c1f65aca9f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f8a602d1-4724-471c-b41f-d767df234dfa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"88e6ec88-f4c1-41e7-8774-9028ce13bb04.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"08b4011e-b8ef-40c6-95af-f5e29468d2eb.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Ocean: Second Evolution","Overview":"Space Date 366: A young Federation officer finds himself transported to a mystical planet, where he is suddenly anointed as the Hero of Light.

The other half is cloaked in constant darkness, and is known as Dark Berge. A miasma-filled chasm called the Black Precipice divides the two halves and has been in place for so long that most residents of the world don’t even know that the other half exists... And now, events loom that threaten both halves of the world. Fate has chosen a champion from each half, and now, the player must choose which champion to play as. The stage has been set. Will it be the best of times, or the worst of times?\n\nIn Hexyz Force, players choose one of the two main characters, either young priestess Cecilia \"Ceci\" Armaclite or veteran knight Levant von Schweitzer. Both paths tell different parts of the story, so the game is effectively two RPGs in one. Combat is initiated on the field map, but much like another Atlus PSP title, battles can be avoided by dodging the enemies on the field.\n\nIf combat is entered, the game turns into a standard turn-based RPG, but with a rock-paper-scissors elemental system called the Divine Aspects. Each weapon is linked to an element, and if the attacks follow the proper pattern, a damage gauge will build that will multiply the damage once the chain breaks. Both the enemy and the player have access to the gauge, so the enemy can use it to unload huge damage onto the player.\n\nAs is the case with most Sting RPGs, weapons are destructible items. The game also has a weapon crafting and fusion system that replaces shops. Players get components to create items from battle or by collecting them from Harvest Points that are spread around the world.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"13789":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alfa System","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f58a288e-1997-427e-a24d-f5e60d4feb44.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e5dab05-148b-4d6f-93cb-48c64cdcb111.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"95ee8450-ad0a-4fb3-b156-5b6cfeeb97d9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7f5b80e3-0b19-4c9a-9eb2-2ffe98e0f730.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92e2a56e-5aaa-4fcc-8fc0-fcccad3022c6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf5af44c-5ccb-4f4a-a2c2-eecea11a72a6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0075b229-c2e0-4cb9-9e2d-237f91ba2d9f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"358a53e4-e2ff-4d52-9233-e518d88f8073.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c378f3e-c290-480e-9b60-a8f8008ccfce.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0913c1b4-6461-4188-ba82-648f93ce7e63.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Phantasy Star Portable","Overview":"Sega's long-running RPG goes handheld for the first time in North America with Phantasy Star Portable, a story set between the events of Phantasy Star Universe and Ambition of the Illuminus.

Then...one day, uncountable hordes of dangerous creatures appeared, bringing chaos to Jikandia and setting the wheels of time turning once again. Plunged suddenly into this newly-temporal reality, the people of Jikandia fell into confusion, terror, and anarchy.\n\nIn the midst of the mayhem gripping the land, an ancient spirit known as Temtem, hoping to restore peace and harmony to the troubled land, somehow gained mastery over time and space. With this new-found power, Temtem attempted to summon the nine heroes of legend. Nine kids on their way to school found themselves summoned through time and space to become the champions of Jikandia. However, only Hall, who was separated from his friends while traveling through the void, appeared before Temtem. Neither of them knew what had happened to Hall's friends, but it soon become clear that Hall had to find them, and right Jikandia's wrongs, if he was ever to return home.\n\nIn Jikandia, you must travel through dungeons in search of your friends. You can set the time limit for each dungeon yourself! Dungeons are altered in several ways according to the time limit you set, so no adventure is the same twice! The longer you spend in one, the more likely you'll come across rare items and treasure chests...but you'll also face more monsters and difficult traps. Also, by meeting certain requirements, you can unlock specific events and cause legendary items to appear. Activating the \"Focus\" mode will make you stronger, faster, and more powerful!

Like its predecessor, the game retells the story from Luo Guangzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms by having the player control an officer from the Wu, Wei or Shu kingdoms through the most important battles of each kingdom's storyline. The playable characters and their appearance are taken from Dynasty Warriors 5.\n\nEach scenario has branching stages, which can be be unlocked by playing the same scenario but choosing a different path. Each battle can then be played in free mode.\n\nThe battles consist of a map separated in numerous smaller areas. These areas can be allied or enemy camps, supply depots, or open fields. The player has to move from area to area, entering a battlefield when the area is under enemy control or is attacked by the enemy army. Defeating enemy officers and squads until their troop's morale drops to 0 will liberate the area, sometimes yielding rewards such as supplies, which add to the total time of the battle, uncover hidden areas, or refill some health.\n\nBefore each stage, the player can equip a different weapon and mount, and choose up to four generic officers to accompany the selected character. Each of these officers has a level, rank, squadron units, and special abilities that will influence the outcome of the battle. Which officer can be selected depends on the player character's command stat. If the command number is 30, it means that officers with a combined level of 30 can be selected.\n\nIn battle, the player has to defeat as many foes as possible by combining regular attacks and charge attacks, and unleashing the series' signature Musou attack. Different weapons allow for more combo attacks and higher attack strength. By defeating enemies, the character will gain experience and level up. However, the level resets between battle, and the gained experience is converted into points to raise the officers ranks. Once a stage's winning conditions are met, the army is deemed victorious, but if the player character is defeated, supplies get exhausted or the main camp is taken, the game is over. Upon victory, the player is rewarded with new officers and weapons or mounts acquired in battle.\n\nNew playable characters are unlocked by completing the Musou mode. Different characters get unlocked depending on which scenario is played, and which battles are won.\n\nOther than the Musou (Story) mode, the game has a Free mode, and Multiplayer mode. The Multiplayer mode allows for up to four players via Ad Hoc and offers different games: Bombs Away, Battle Royal, Time Attack and Sudden Death.","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dynasty_Warriors_Vol._2"},"13965":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ys: Napishtim no Hako","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Falcom","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b43bff8f-d2e9-4849-a011-20fcd4f6bfa2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"07a4484d-5c45-4c4a-b896-5282164d28c9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"628079e7-1134-47ba-a157-5b66d16c84b6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8b0574bc-c012-4bae-81d1-5d1d6ca0f60e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9a51730e-3f9a-4be4-b64b-dafa0958c1c0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a5bf38ec-343f-44bb-a1e4-66102f2250b1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b1d131c6-2411-492b-83a4-6756764f0be7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ff5b6af2-0e78-4f1f-a213-3a56d73fadeb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"78738373-54db-40c4-9e5a-78387fdeef27.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"da5be1ec-daa2-4052-8743-307b2255df22.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9b9efaf8-5bf4-4b31-af90-20100258c394.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"35a14573-ae97-449c-be6e-3db6a899de8f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2e7be512-ebdf-43b6-bbe2-03ac47b809e4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"196342d3-6b7c-4534-b61f-f60168b4b2a7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"33eee19b-07b6-4297-b948-e8dac90ca9d7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1531b7fa-2ad7-4686-9a1a-8e53e9d8eff0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"95916f37-4043-41f2-9fb2-04e321dc8f47.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ys: The Ark of Napishtim","Overview":"The story begins after Adol's ship is attacked by a fleet of Romun ships.

In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.\n\nKnights in the Nightmare can be considered a tactical role-playing game, though it features a number of gameplay elements unusual for the genre. The game is almost entirely stylus-controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines an active-time turn-based combat, somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy as well as real-time strategy games, with bullet-hell shoot 'em up-like sequences, relying on a set of unorthodox requirements for the successful completion of its battles.\n\nOnce in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.\n\nThe game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer part of the attributes of a character into another, more or less well depending on the poured soul's degree of loyalty, as well as the existence of a relationship between the two characters and the nature of it.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EfzoPvDEgKg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knights_in_the_Nightmare"},"14003":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"4fa5c625-1d24-4c2d-9ffa-8609f2268ba6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7bd5c841-b622-47d1-b155-a76b286d0681.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd50c836-f175-4f9f-baab-bcfb969e7a52.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"039afef8-8566-4b2b-9ba0-fc827ce98bfb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cb96ef18-d92f-4440-b060-75b573dacb43.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"09a2de3c-4bf4-4bb8-aeff-5bc5c14b60d7.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"f6a38980-21ba-40cc-b9f3-fde0aba01583.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bc166369-942c-4b5d-b845-f02aec6e6817.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner","Overview":"Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner is an RPG by Cozy Okada focusing on monster collection and battles.

Players are given control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T\/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of \"Formation Arts,\" which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T\/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. \"Combination Arts\" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly. On the other hand, the enemy gets the same advantage.","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":"2008-03-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14258":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Riviera: Yakusoku no Chi","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sting","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"ffb9a4be-586e-4354-be8b-b1586d2ea20a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"51cad9c1-e753-422a-ad1a-61f72fbe188f.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c6ee017b-7560-433d-8204-a99035660cd8.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"332a4daf-fa2a-4df6-88c7-74eee92d24ee.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b364b90c-3bb0-4bb5-bf78-0f311c190da0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"24b26399-828c-4d7e-9a09-7a3b127dc4dd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4acaef34-5c89-4bad-9300-0b1a5cadfda9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6c5b8115-8fa5-4661-bf8f-3fb01958b756.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac2b3d3a-21df-4b8e-a174-e466006bec2a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bdfcde4b-ea27-4a3d-a0d1-d3f3bb7ba332.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8da5871b-c49a-45a0-95ec-0b3f4d4437e4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a9f43a2-9d8a-4ebd-b7ff-c6605ec86dc8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6b245331-702a-41f7-84fc-04fff0941e4f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"47945365-7055-4d61-9716-4dbf4ccc289e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5eb51f16-1b03-4997-a39c-16554958e8ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"535b0650-0426-4eb9-b150-3d7797caaf9e.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"218082b8-b8ce-436c-b8e2-1054d57ee2a6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4596c511-477e-44f0-9e3e-448dd724632b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Riviera: The Promised Land","Overview":"During the great Ragnarok war, the gods of Asgard were overrun by demons from Utgard. In order to save the rest of the world from demons, the gods sacrificed their lives to create Grim Angels, black-winged warriors armed with sacred weapons known as \"Diviners\". The Grim Angels defeated the demons, and turned Utgard into a beautiful land, Riviera.\n\nThousand years later, a rumor concerning the demons' return begins to spread. Hector, one of the seven Magi entrusted by the gods to watch over Riviera, sends the Grim Angels Ein and Ledah there, ordering them to activate the \"Retribution\", a power that would eliminate the demons but also destroy Riviera. Ein is defeated by Ursula, Riviera's guardian, and wakes up with amnesia, unaware of his past and the role he will have to play in the future of the land.\n\nRiviera: The Promised Land is a Japanese-style role-playing game. Unlike most RPGs, it does not allow the player to physically navigate a character to explore the game world. Instead, the player activates \"triggers\", i.e. events that lead to cutscenes, combat, items, etc., by spending special trigger points earned during battles. This is done by investigating areas, moving from screen to screen.\n\nOnce a turn-based battle is triggered, the player selects three active combatants out of the available five, selects a formation for the party (attack- or magic-oriented), and chooses which four items to bring into the battle. The items activate skills for various characters; if a character has been trained with that item, he or she can use powerful \"OverSkills\" by gradually filling the OverDrive gauge. Items can be used a limited amount of times before they break.\n\nThe game also contains dating gameplay elements. The player can make decisions for Ein concerning his female companions, raising or lowering their trust level and eventually reaching one of the multiple endings determined by the relationships between Ein and the young women in his party.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2007-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14259":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ragnarok: Hikari to Yami no Koujo","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ApolloSoft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"b7619cc9-a469-402a-91af-9f9700e6c0e7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fe7c8319-cef1-4619-b294-b0cbe50f45e6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d9f130a4-4050-4ac5-b856-fc8de101a630.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73baded8-5828-4d2c-be98-7ae7d804a8b9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e683fdbd-8b97-4359-8c43-46da2073badd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b9a1c7b0-32f8-468a-a04d-5b5a86cf5b43.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8c67c963-2f6c-45a0-aa6c-5b20d8777bae.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ragnarok Tactics","Overview":"Many centuries after the legendary Holy War that forced humanity to erect a magical barrier to keep both gods and demons from overrunning their world, the Branshaldo Empire and the Aura Republic engaged in an extended war for control of the Grantria Peninsula.

It builds upon the previous year's version with updated rosters, new control options and new game modes.\n\nThe game includes 27 leagues from 20 countries (adding the Turkish league), plus various rest-of-the-world and international teams, the same selection as in the console version. Returning modes include Kick-Off for friendlies, tournaments and challenges (with 31 new comeback and 30 new rout challenges) and wi-fi multiplayer (ad-hoc and infrastructure). The manager mode, already an established feature in the console versions, makes its debut on the PSP in this game. It tasks players with managing a club team, taking care of sponsors, the club board, and fan relations in addition to success on the pitch. PSP manager careers are compatible with those from the PS2 version and can be exchanged via PS2-PSP link. Exclusive to the PSP version is player training via mini-games (which are also available on their own): the returning Juggling and the new Wall Attack. In Wall Attack, the goal is to kick the ball at a wall of colored blocks for points, with a certain number necessary within a time limit to advance to the next level. Some blocks contain icons that have additional effects, like clearing neighboring blocks or blocks of the same color.\n\nAmong the new control options are chip shots and various new configurations: there is a choice between player control via analog stick or d-pad (or both, but without on-the-fly tactics changes) and optional PES-style button layout.\nFIFA 07 sponsored Accrington Stanley for the 2007–08 season, with the FIFA 07 logo displayed on the back of the team's shirts.[5]","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14478":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tate Interactive Sp z.o.o","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1bf9e663-637e-4d4f-b269-eb412d016393.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"303bf3dc-cf43-41cb-8be6-60ffbecf8c23.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"82190213-11eb-4a58-babc-080cded454d7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3ef8df33-4ad9-4c05-ae7b-4417d90b9174.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"de55446a-93ad-4c29-9526-205eb64e82b0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8b7685fd-6219-4100-86c8-5c6d234442ab.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"81f8da5e-1cd0-4b91-8f75-7cab8da2dc98.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Kao Challengers","Overview":"This is a conversion of the platform game Kao the Kangaroo Round 2 ported to PSP.

Created players can be used in the new \"My Player\" simulation mode, where the created basketballer rises from an undrafted rookie through the entirety of his NBA career.

This optionally updates rosters and stats to reflect changes in the actual NBA (including trades and injuries), down to offering date-specific color commentary based on when the game is being played.\n\nA variety of other gameplay tweaks have been made, including new dribbling and defensive controls, lockdown defense, a new stamina system, 24 active play calls, and the ability to save progress in the middle of a game and return to it later.","Publisher":"2K Sports","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14482":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Funatics Software","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"049242f1-2c1f-4e72-b79c-ce54a9e2426b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eaef4d9d-3162-4f9c-9a56-70b6efba5ca6.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7e56f8be-70e1-4fec-a0c8-8ae2bc77892f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ea8ba369-407a-4808-b7e5-3f36cd01f7eb.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d4928f5c-df20-46d9-a5a8-9d8e9d3a2069.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0cb79748-b821-4721-b5c9-80b987360fb7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d67dba99-6894-4f49-bdb2-98d5f798db62.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tom Clancy's EndWar","Overview":"The handheld version of Tom Clancy's EndWar is a hex based turn based strategy game similar to the Battle Isle series. The game takes place in the 2020s and a conflict has arisen between the three big powers of the world: Europe, USA and Russia. The single player mode allows the player to play through one campaign for each of the powers. There is also a multi player mode for two players and a map editor that allows for user created maps.\n\nGameplay consists of two phases: action and movement. When one player is in the movement phase the other is in the action phase. When the phase ends the commands are executed, first the actions and then the movements. This means that units only can move if they first survive the attacks of the enemy. The player has access to both land, air and sea units depending on the mission. The units get experience points when damaging and destroying enemy units. More experience points leads to more powerful and robust units. To get more units the player can capture buildings such as depots, airfields and harbors which can produce a few more units. They can also be used to repair damaged units. Another building is the HQ. When this is captured the player loses the mission. After losing a mission in the campaign mode it's possible to ask for reinforcement units when retrying the mission.\n\nSpecial tactical manoeuvres of the game include blocking and jamming. Blocking means that the movement of a unit gets limited when its route is threatened by an enemy unit. Jamming involves surrounding an enemy unit with more than one unit which leads to a combat bonus. The bonus depends on the position of the units. Placing a friendly units directly behind the enemy for example leads to a 50% higher bonus. Different units have different capabilities in combat. For example airplanes can only attack other airplanes but not land or sea units. Some units such as the artillery have a larger range and can attack units that are several hexes away from them.","Publisher":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14483":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"El Senor de los Anillos: Las Aventuras de Aragorn","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TT Fusion","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b65cf9bc-b3bd-4060-8d30-287c2bb83304.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e8c3054-9da8-4f2d-951a-eff9ac2a9a62.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"733f1013-9900-49d5-a98f-ee46d2e1450f.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e2b07cb-f74e-496b-aa3b-10788f7e4ea7.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7286a9d-4e16-4c94-91a9-64dd36a76aa4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3cca35bc-0bd9-470b-80a2-3d8b2d36f0ee.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5913f89-c869-42f3-b323-2aad844d21d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e138274e-28ce-4728-a42d-1d7d0fbb9f35.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"93ee5c2e-dd78-4e27-9017-61ff0d71c5c8.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest","Overview":"The handheld and PlayStation 2 version of Aragorn's Quest follows the same story as the eponymous console version: the story of Aragorn during the War of the Ring is narrated by Frodo's friend, Samwise Gamgee, who recalls the story to entertain his children who want to know about the adventures of the one known as Strider.

Players experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and Mordor.\n\nUnlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold. In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen. This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.\n\nThe game features over 24 levels and includes the vast majority of characters from the films, such as Aragorn and Gandalf, the hobbits, as well as key villains such as Saruman and the Balrog. Players can choose between good and evil campaigns, so the entire game can be experienced from each of their perspectives.\n\nCharacters can level up, gain abilities, and purchase equipment between levels, reminiscent of EA's The Third Age game. Since the battles are mostly small skirmishes, your characters' attributes and abilities (or lack thereof) can easily swing battles.\n\nFinally, the game also offers a multiplayer skirmish mode for up to four players.

Unlike the console game, the handheld version focuses on the fourth Indiana Jones movie, with elements from the earlier films only appearing in mini-game format and some unlockable bonuses.\n\nThe story of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is retold in three acts of four chapters each, with comic-book-style cutscenes between levels. The levels themselves follow the usual LEGO game format: players control several characters and can switch between them at will. Different characters have different abilities which must be used in combination to overcome challenges and solve puzzles. For instance, Indy can use his whip, Marion and other female characters can cross special ledges and Indy's son Mutt can use his knife to cut ropes and can also climb walls. A major part of the game is the collecting of LEGO studs, red and gold bricks and other hidden items, which unlock various bonuses like additional characters. Finding pages of Indy's journal unlocks one of 16 mini-games.\n\nThe mini-games are inspired by certain scenes from all four movies, including the rolling boulder run from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the mine cart chase from Temple of Doom and the three trials from Last Crusade. The games usually task the player to survive for a certain time or to collect a certain number of studs before dying or reaching the end of the level.","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iZjRqZdblFc"},"14489":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bokujou Monogatari: Sugar Mura to Minna no Negai","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Marvelous Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"39768d1a-d559-4b2c-b26c-6241a1a9c7c2.PNG","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"181d84df-3337-42ec-a10f-66c4c548231a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5a9e189d-a19b-4e7d-842e-9fc35d0c5d69.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"73fe09af-89ab-444e-b137-30b5e5352cc8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"58cdebe9-3833-4d6f-85c8-0cb766c76475.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f578875-67b1-4b7e-a67d-3ae1fe52db84.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"de67c127-80e2-4183-9551-18744efc004e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0de7c78-8953-414f-84b5-2417e4d6d8f1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f862e8a8-3dc3-4add-88a5-18324e8a1983.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a4721af0-4d9f-4a08-bcb2-78090be01bda.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ef98e73e-f04e-4a70-97ac-389807248876.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"9312075e-a2b0-47bf-8757-3c4575233688.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4f7d2177-5a44-4b4e-beba-87b4bd23cf56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley","Overview":"Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley, like Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland before it, is a little different from the other Harvest Moon games because instead of starting a farm from scratch, you start with a fully functional, albeit deserted and overgrown, farm and have to keep it from being destroyed.

And remember - You Gotta Believe!\n\nPaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow. You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.\n\nOf course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!\n\nThe PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original. However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.","Publisher":"SCEA","ReleaseDate":"2007-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ngBGOrVZyek"},"14600":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Virtuos","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ce2f7626-d498-46aa-b778-cf4fc346d2c6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dfb72932-53f8-4e64-94c9-14764f61d4f7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"acc31da7-7e0e-480d-8e08-7aa96cb960dc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bcea8ebc-595c-477a-bf7a-f30ab26a695c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"310745a4-7e7b-46d6-aee5-6097a299180a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e36b0dd0-654d-4532-999e-ce58e3718364.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Beowulf: The Game","Overview":"Gamers live the life of Beowulf, the legendary Norse warrior with the strength of 30 men who is torn between the nobility and brutality within him.

It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.\n\nYou start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.\n\nDefeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.\n\nThe big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:\n\nThere are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14922":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"High Voltage Software","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4bd40703-b72d-4218-ae1c-937953a0c0d3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dfb95f6f-282a-4509-aab0-961c73da908a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb899a61-531e-4441-9421-6a6f6a639580.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"69fcde87-ea5b-464c-8f29-618a86075854.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8b22f4fd-0423-4244-80c8-e86068295e4b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c88ca9ea-e867-4805-ac5a-aa20e605a847.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c684270f-6e7d-4116-89e4-ea05430abfca.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ben 10: Protector of Earth","Overview":"Ben 10: Protector of Earth is an action game based on the cartoon series Ben 10.

Unlosing Ranger vs Darkdeath Evilman","Overview":"In the year 20XX, in Tokyo, Japan, the prophecized savior of humanity, Super Baby gets kidnapped by Demon General Darkdeath Evilman. Only the hero Absolute Victory Unlosing Ranger can defeat him...until he gets hit by a van. Before passing away, the hero passes on his Morph Belt to a random bystander, who must then become the Unlosing Ranger and face Darkdeath Evilman...\n\nZ.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman is a roguelike tactical RPG featuring a single character rather than a party. The levels are accessed from a hub, the Hero Base, found on a planet on the other side of the sun, Bizarro Earth. Unlosing Ranger must face enemies by himself by moving around in each of the isometric dungeon maps. When the main character enters the enemies' Field of View Range, he gets noticed, and the enemy who has seen him will start following him around. Moving around the map takes EN, which is also needed to use special skills. It also gradually replenished HP, unless no EN is left. As he moves around, the protagonist can pick-up items to use and equip. Equipment pieces have a durability stat (COND.). Worn items are less effective and must be repaired at the blacksmith's shop, or throw at enemies to deal damage. When an enemy is defeated, it emits a Death Cry. Any other enemy in range of the Death Cry will also notice the Unlosing Ranger and become hostile. After battle, the hero gains XP and levels-up, boosting his stats.\n\nMost dungeons have their own specific gameplay mechanics, such as cannons used to reach higher or farther places. And upon entering each dungeon, the hero's level is reseted to 1, and the gained levels add-up to his total when it is completed. At the end of each chapter, Unlosing Ranger faces against Darkdeath Evilman. Each of those battle is different, in a classic turn-based RPG style, the first being reminiscent of Dragon Quest's first-person view battles, progressing to more detailed modern battles...","Publisher":"NIS America","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zMEqIzM843U","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Z.H.P._Unlosing_Ranger_VS_Darkdeath_Evilman"},"15055":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alfa System","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"c3412059-443c-4af9-b29c-680bd2680ec8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2a52f398-afd2-4846-b0fc-3dbf42485c59.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d7ac04a7-c9bb-4f62-bb46-7a8eaa4165de.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"52968f00-fe00-46ef-a5c9-eb7190847a6f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8577b614-3dff-484b-902a-acc661bcd3bc.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5d05ed6-c9a7-47ec-aee0-2c8e9942cc66.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"863c7761-9593-4d20-a017-cee6d5c2fcff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3490ddb5-0d55-44ad-8216-5114b9a8f187.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Phantasy Star Portable 2","Overview":"Return to the Phantasy Star Portable world in a global online multiplayer experience!

Unlike all previous games the only thing the player is able to choose when starting the game is the name of the main character. The game takes place in the year of 2022 on a small island located in the southern hemisphere. The player is not cast as human teenager as in previous games, but as a brand new robot - created by Dr. Hopes from in Volcano Town. This time it is not possible to marry for instance. The main goal is to save the island from destruction by angry spirits of nature. To do so, the robot will learn how to develop more human characteristics.\n\nMuch has changed in terms of how the game plays out compared to other entries in the series. Many of these changes are improvements as well as fixes to over-exploited tricks in the previous titles. One of the major improvements to game is the ability to walk through crops that have been planted. Seeds are now planted in 1x1 squares as opposed to the old 9x9 method of planting. Seeds are now also purchased in individual numbers as opposed to bags of 9. Crops and flowers are no longer destroyed if players accidentally drop them on the ground for some time. Things grown in the wild cannot longer be exploited. Instead a special “Scale Pack” is required to harvest them and only 3kg can be carried at all times.\n\nCrops grown in the wild are no longer available every single day of the season. Like in real life they now have specific “regrowth” periods as well as specific schedules on which the fruits or other things are fully grown and able to be harvested. Time no longer stops when inside a farm, but it stops when other people's houses are entered. The entire field is no longer available right at the start of the game. It needs to be increased by unlocking the seals on it. Gems to unlock them come from the story quests and the exploration of caves. The time hierarchy has also been changed. Players can now choose to get up earlier than usual, but only if the character goes to sleep before 21:00 (11:00 PM).","Publisher":"Rising Star Games","ReleaseDate":"2007-05-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15064":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Neverland","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c15a8458-ed41-43b5-b724-e6068925d0eb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"baaa5842-d325-4bec-93d5-d6df696e3b60.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e1e88fd-214e-414a-8284-396504c7e933.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"31007350-626b-4a3c-ab03-76c25069ad69.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"222824e7-d23d-4f6e-8edf-c94c7c67a29f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3978e51b-477d-45bb-901a-8cec59697fe6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3cef1bb3-fcb4-492e-aa2b-4986fdffda90.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"673697f9-875a-41ca-95f8-e15e4e41449c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"38b5d9f4-b83b-4bb1-a114-5c6c9d2590cc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"32925cfb-df32-455b-bbc8-5fdfca96e1ea.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Blazing Souls: Accelate","Overview":"The story begins with Zero the protagonist making his living as an independent contractor.

The warrior has two means of attack – a bow and a staff, but there’s not much he can do in an open combat against several soldiers or robots, so he needs to hide behind objects or in the grass and attack stealthily. The warrior collects ‘Eywa spirits’ to upgrade his weapons and the “way of the hunter” – a skill that allows him to stay undetected longer or increase attack strength. There are some flying missions as well. The scrolling is automatic, so the warrior just needs to maneuver on screen avoiding bombs or projectiles and shoot down enemies.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2009-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8kiV2BmmbE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Cameron%27s_Avatar:_The_Game"},"15314":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Papaya Studio","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"06e96634-3956-4a3f-9ad2-02fe8bd30d7f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d8d345fd-27c6-40ae-96a0-d4a4b81f3949.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a78b881e-3cd4-4afd-b54f-44dfa1de307d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aa6d04df-82d6-41de-a01d-3ade439bc09f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2cc654a8-1550-4544-9d8a-f00c4939202e.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien Cosmic Destruction","Overview":"Based on Cartoon Network's all-new new television series, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, the Ben 10: Ultimate Alien: Cosmic Destruction will allow players to wield the power of the all-new Ultimatrix, the strongest Omnitrix to date, to transform Ben into more powerful, hyper-evolved alien forms and experience impressive battles as the most ultimate aliens for the first time in never before seen places.","Publisher":"D3 Publisher","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15319":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rejet","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"16d181f2-7639-4116-b8a6-2f54ac121eaa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"98d5a70c-3fef-40d1-9008-5c0bb82958fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Beyond the Future: Fix the Time Arrows","Overview":"Lilith is a novice priestess in the shrine of Dodona.

Dive attributes will determine the keepers with the ability to reach for further shots while reflex attributes determine reaction times, so a keeper like Petr Cech of Chelsea FC will show be able to showcase world-class skills.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H0jH7_cnnvs"},"15564":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team Fusion","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"f3fb752a-2304-44b3-8c25-c01a37369ed6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4c4e39a6-6e1b-446d-abe6-8838e201af0b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"537a526a-682c-4c54-8f96-5d41257c7987.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5da10539-3c0d-4c8a-86a7-9a001ec77840.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c1729a3-7e04-42df-9d99-6bc9db253b6b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4a04b23a-0d0e-44c6-ac18-627a35435bdf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"86e6e4b6-8f80-411e-a9de-7c05e5da448b.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Fight Night Round 3","Overview":"Fight Night Round 3 is the third installment of the EA boxing (sports) franchise and the first boxing game to appear on the PSP.

Additional weapons become available to help players meet these new challenges.\n\nThe game's story was authored by comic book writer Matt Fraction, and combines plot elements from the film with Iron Man comic book lore. In a side plot not featured in the movie, the hero fights his regular comic book rival, the battle-suited Crimson Dynamo. High-stakes challenges threaten ultimate defeat through each chapter of action, and the game concludes with the fate of the entire world once again in the weapon-clad hands of the invincible Iron Man.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2010-05-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fnje6Iarlnc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron_Man_2_(video_game)"},"15708":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Silhwang Powerful Proyagu 2010","Region":"Korea"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"70025851-b81f-444b-afd8-be5d74a6a83d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e4dabf21-a10d-4db3-875f-18e56c7a6af5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2010","Overview":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2010 is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2010.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2010-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15710":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"85f32bc5-724c-4d9d-8b9b-7e6bfa197310.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"43d76883-1d6f-44be-b2db-fbb5293b7f26.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011","Overview":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011 is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2011.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2011-07-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15713":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"820406e6-dee1-48e5-9f32-d457dbaa5867.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8114b35a-d5f1-468b-a890-80b2a917a6d6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011 Ketteiban","Overview":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2011 Ketteiban is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2011.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2011-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15715":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e46d8f00-66ee-4a84-80af-60ce5151168d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"11b2773b-cb06-4ebd-9bc5-8fa42052ed64.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"615bf049-de5f-4445-a464-b67f2530fc7a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2012","Overview":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2012 is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2012.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15718":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"9c9ccb84-212a-430b-a38e-a8d739fb6cb9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5c1ba7ac-de8c-4e26-95f9-03bf07786664.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2012 Ketteiban","Overview":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2012 Ketteiban is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2012.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2012-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15740":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zerodiv","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"85eb3d56-a304-43a8-8b36-9b611bd8446a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92932749-ef0d-45dd-a418-4fd130925e7f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ken to Mahou to Gakuen Mono. 3","Overview":"Class of Heroes 3 is a Role-Playing game, developed by Zerodiv and published by Acquire, which was released in Japan in 2010.","Publisher":"Acquire","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15787":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paradigm Entertainment","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action;

The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.\n\nMatches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.\n\nThe are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.","Publisher":"2K Sports","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15868":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kush Games, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"94442ce9-5233-4c08-9171-871daed7f4f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"96fe39f4-9eba-4537-81dd-a941b8755fe7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5abce497-1d4c-4970-9a24-4bddba3ce681.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8f8d9af7-878a-4b30-a9c9-ac5e98ebd269.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1c394104-f61e-4310-9cc2-f54d1c6181a5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"906721f7-e1e2-4e40-818f-6a21a3b0fa00.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"e5f68c28-e684-40ca-b756-d25dbc62634c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6b585a31-9416-4e44-bf95-aab5758c1284.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Major League Baseball 2K8","Overview":"The PSP version of MLB 2K8 is similar to its console cousins, featuring the same gameplay mechanics designed to fit the PSP, relying on the D-Pad to pick pitch locations and spots in the batter box as opposed to the analog for the 360, PS3 and PS2 versions.

Every such spirit confers a different time-manipulating power on the player.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2010-05-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gYwy0gSsRfg"},"15979":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visual Concepts Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a4e341a0-37d0-478b-9f8f-caa1d6e1dc83.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8d9a906d-746e-4df9-9998-9b5e79ed520a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e4ea4adb-fe3a-4cf6-af7d-ada12741ce08.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dda066d0-cd7e-4ea1-8ced-ea3cbabb09a9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"615af4e1-f148-4841-8336-7fa6e68a6143.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc0865f4-275a-4162-b89e-f75b24dda6fd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed2725be-78a3-430e-9b22-12b339637cc5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3e1f60f3-9d84-464c-920e-6aea57927df1.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"NBA 2K11","Overview":"It's the #1 selling and rated NBA series that everyone is playing - from the most elite NBA athletes and superstars to the local court gym rats.

The basic principle is simple: on each of the 13 courses (ten have to be unlocked first) the player can choose between several championships, e.g. regular races, time races or elimination. If he wins he receives money which he uses to upgrade his car and improve its abilities.\n\nAdditionally he also receives experience points (unique to this version of the game) which depend on the used driving helps. If he gets a new level his abilities improve - it is also important because some events are only available after reaching a certain level. In comparison to the regular version the drift and drag events are missing. In return there is a new one which is a mix between checkpoint race and elimination: after every checkpoint the last driver gets eliminated.

A unique feature of the handheld version are pirate duels: when prompted, players have to press a button rapidly, which is then followed by a quick-time event, for which two out of three of the indicated buttons must be hit for a successful strike against the enemy.","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios","ReleaseDate":"2011-05-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16210":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"PES 2008: Pro Evolution Soccer","Region":"Europe"},{"Name":"World Soccer Winning Eleven Ubiquitous Edition 2008","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0dee12af-8fe4-4c6c-a890-405d6dd713b7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"425ce1e7-d1b2-4563-b837-fc67fc039768.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e4030f41-222f-4c9e-9830-82c8413289d9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5eb5bf2f-f78e-4a74-ba9d-6515199bffbd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e818e9ee-6568-49e0-8d99-3d3d1c99f04c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5ad7dd18-4130-4143-9a1a-b49cd76f4511.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"813b4d27-5ec9-4e60-8b10-6e3dd58ae734.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5eba679f-31bb-4865-ab47-0ec9ee1b669c.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"PES 2008: Pro Evolution Soccer","Overview":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is a simulation of the soccer sport.

Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode. For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to \"real\" speed). The basic batting interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel. Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes. The pitching is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16250":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infinite Interactive Pty.

Although seemingly a top-down arcade shooter, the title is described as an album of games, where music, gameplay and visuals are interwoven, inspired by the Rez concept. The player controls a pixel-shaped character through a series of 8 fixed-screen stages, using one stick to move and another one to shoot. The overall goal is to clear the stage of all enemies, but the mechanics to achieve this vary in each level. The same applies for combos and chain reactions. Sometimes enemies cannot be defeated directly, but require a sequence of colors or a special object that triggers the entire field. There is only a single gun with no upgrades or changes.\n\nEach stage has a different soundtrack toned to match the visuals. All sounds of destruction have been replaced by guitar notes or riffs, leading to a sea of sound that harmonizes with the overall soundtrack, causing the music to be generated procedurally.\n\nNext to the main goal there are bonus points to collect, used to unlock extras such as extra lives and new graphical effects. Completing a level opens it up in the Single Play mode, where it can be selected right away.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment America","ReleaseDate":"2008-12-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16428":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"SBK 08: Superbike World Championship","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Milestone S.r.l.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"98977a99-0147-46d4-a714-3fba39f1e037.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e466ed58-d007-471d-8348-669eb94b7d98.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ca1375a1-455d-40fc-b724-bbed24ff5e69.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8cfc88b9-c28e-4bff-b190-cddf01faf3ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5bbd3e5c-bfe3-4d53-8ed0-1d2296b56155.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4747e104-9292-46c7-836c-b326b299cb65.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"16bbd8c3-7acb-40aa-8860-09f60c72b5b7.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"SBK Superbike World Championship","Overview":"SBK-08 is the official videogame of the Superbike World Championship.\n\nIt offers a wide range of gameplay, selectable from 5 different pre-sets, from a very basic gameplay for new players to a full featured simulation for those looking for the challenge of riding a Superbike.\n\nThe player has the possibility to choose from the 2008 official riders, teams and tracks, but also improve the performances of his bike, managing and tuning a lot of aspects like top speed, gear ratios, suspension stiffness, and set of tires for single race.","Publisher":"Black Bean Games","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16437":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Milestone S.r.l.","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"53188ffc-234c-4193-be11-9cd0250c34f5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7334441c-f88e-4474-8d2e-93bc722f1508.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fbd24d85-c721-4bcf-9d70-913b2f6b5cb1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"SBK-09: Superbike World Championship","Overview":"SBK 09: Superbike World Championship is the official licensed game from the motorcycle Superbike World Championship league.

Of course there is also the option to play just a single racing weekend or to start in a quick race. \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor there are two notable changes: driving helps for novice players and 20 challenges. In these the player either has to solve certain problems in pre-defined situations, e.g. winning the race with worn out brakes or reaching checkpoints in a limited time frame.","Publisher":"Black Bean Games","ReleaseDate":"2008-06-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16440":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"SBK-07: Superbike World Championship","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Milestone","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3a11c468-04a8-407f-a762-d6860299a0a5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"843079e8-5610-4567-827c-754f85b8b0ef.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a3668b2f-df13-4659-876e-8491297f64dc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c9a461fc-bb64-42d8-afaf-4b2e3f12b666.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3eabbb35-7952-4418-8030-fcf4470ea9df.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6735c6ee-b717-47c3-9d99-92f56b2cc5fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ffd4536a-c1ea-44f8-8317-cc83da1d7aa9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Hannspree Ten Kate Honda SBK","Overview":"SBK-07: Superbike World Championship is the official game based on the Superbike World Championship.\n\nAll the real elements are in the game, including official tracks, riders, and sessions.

Suddenly, a video game manual lands right in front of him. Miraculously, after having read the manual, the members of the Simpsons family discover that each of them possesses a unique superpower. Toying with these, however, attracts the attention of the aliens Kang and Kodos, who decide to invade the Earth. Now the unlikely superheroes must not only protect the town of Springfield from an alien assault, but also find the true reason behind their newly acquired powers, and perhaps their very existence.\n\nThe Simpsons Game is a 3D action game with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements, based on the long-running cartoon. The game is divided into sixteen episodes, each containing cutscenes reminiscent of the original Simpsons TV series. Every episode is set in a different environment; some of the scenarios are based in Springfield, while others take the player into meta-virtual worlds. Some of the episodes parody a popular game or genre, having names like Medal of Homer or Neverquest. Each stage features two members of the Simpson clan working together to achieve the goal. Players must switch back and forth using each family members' unique powers to complete the level. Most of the game's versions allow two-player cooperative play.\n\nThe four controllable characters have their own unique abilities, which are used for combat, puzzle-solving, or exploration-related purposes. Homer can expand into a rolling blob or inflate himself with helium and float for a while; later, he learns a few other transformation abilities. Bart can become Bartman, using a grappling hook to access certain areas, as well as move upwards in air streams with his cape. Lisa's main ability is called \"Hand of Buddha\", which is used mainly for moving around large objects; she can also play her saxophone to stun or confuse enemies. Finally, Marge can gather people with her megaphone and control their actions, as well as send the little Maggie into crawlspaces only she can access. Some of these abilities have limited uses and must be either recharged or replenished with special items, while others are available only at specific trigger points.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PGlzCaV_0aA"},"16709":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Image Epoch","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"4e643a1d-365b-4cb5-9d52-cfc982c21363.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e93e4915-59c7-4dea-9f03-0e07ac630260.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ef759445-034d-4cda-9148-d7b81125d839.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2e21fbf5-ce1c-4b9f-8f00-31d9081c686b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e108682-7e8e-40c3-bc8f-ea63bd3de201.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"63068400-c1c4-40e0-addf-10d80c8e5839.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f38ca887-6b88-4792-9785-35681714970b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"45e531c5-88a8-44b3-92b9-e5462d860dbc.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"f663a36d-cb42-4f55-ac19-94f56f0008fc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fate\/Extra","Overview":"Waking up in a strange virtual world with no recollection of the past, the main character finds themselves forced to fight for survival in a war they do not understand for a prize beyond value; the opportunity to have one's wish granted.

These events take place roughly 100 years after those in the original Alien Syndrome.\n\nWhen you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as demolitions expert, firebug, seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged or close attacks, speed, healing power, resistance to fire\/radiation, armor strength, and so on.\n\nSimilar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You'll need to explore the numerous corridors and rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again at the last checkpoint crossed.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2007-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16770":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Bandai Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"dfb0d934-d409-41c4-a8b9-d52c98fa2627.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"682d55a7-7d63-4785-8982-81d0b7a82335.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c08a54a5-10a6-44c4-b873-a227916fe225.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d759375-a00c-46a7-a1b4-deef43028ac6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4456a2b9-c7da-47db-8d59-749313c06ea5.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ac532d37-95b0-4854-9652-56b114eb6e83.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment","Overview":"This is a game, but you are not a player.

Humanity bands together and fights back valiantly, but they are simply no match for the invading force, and their numbers steadily dwindle as fighting continues. At the brink of extinction after years of war, one last hope for humanity appears: Black Rock Shooter, a young girl who is also the most powerful biological weapon ever created. Working together with the last remnants of the human race, will she be able to repel the alien invasion and save the Earth?\n\nBlack Rock Shooter is an action-RPG based on the anime of the same name. It is in many ways a standard Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the eponymous Black Rock Shooter as she explores the battle-ravaged landscape, and enemies will approach her when they notice her. If they get close enough, the game will switch to battle mode, which is closer to a rail shooter rather than a standard turn-based battle system.\n\nDuring battle, enemies will attack in real time. The player controls a cursor to aim Black Rock's rock cannon, and can shoot freely, as well as block, dodge, and use various items and special skills, but she cannot move freely around the battlefield. Certain actions will increase a heat gauge, which will only lower if she is allowed to rest.

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.\n\nBetween scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.\n\nAs you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill. The Wii Remote controls a flashlight aimed in real-time. Harry's cell phone accepts calls and messages from both the real and the supernatural, and a camera function is used to uncover hidden ghosts and their messages.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2010-01-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=42FF9ismMWY"},"16921":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Silent Hill Zero","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Climax Group","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"d51b4bc7-839e-470a-b71a-045f0288b8c2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4f43c075-f118-4506-b2ea-e3036a4c0a5d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"491c4506-2096-4824-9891-19b1664d3773.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a72c5768-ddf2-4c1b-844d-a7dc40847e30.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a5909044-6bad-4184-b867-1cd1546cf7b2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dba145b4-934a-4f00-88bf-1760250e8be6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"baf61b14-5d01-4445-af04-aebc372dbda0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6692f832-d12d-47e8-87d5-1b951af07f0f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5bba24c6-792b-4232-bf18-3e62e2ffefdb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4863fed-7031-4ae9-a53f-a8a4667b0134.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b97ad396-eeb2-4742-a001-954d380b312c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"52864bee-f8ea-457a-9bd9-3e625f85f6ae.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3929f88c-128a-4c9d-8127-93f9bbee8e8a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fab4b07e-eebe-4deb-8c64-205a712d2cb9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"54c9a73e-3543-4917-bde5-7b61f6ef6ece.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e03c20bc-3080-49fa-acd9-2d42e9708d81.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"e2d66e86-6a16-4d4e-8d9e-011dd37e4ebb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Silent Hill: Origins","Overview":"The renowned Silent Hill survival horror series makes its handheld gaming debut with a brand new adventure that reveals many of the series' most hallowed secrets.

The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart.\n\nThere are 3 other game modes available in singleplayer: OutRun, Time Attack and OutRun2SP. In OutRun2SP you get access to 15 arcade tracks from the original OutRun 2. In OutRun however you need to drive your girlfriend through various checkpoints to the goal before the timer hits zero. In Time Attack you just have to beat the highscore of the current track. You can either race against the clock or against ghost cars.\n\nIn every mode you get OutRun miles after the race. These are the currency of the game and are needed to unlock new cars, upgrades and additional music-stations.\n\nIf you feel alone, even with your virtual girlfriend in the car, you can race online against 5 other players.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2006-04-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ftV4K3UwL_U","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OutRun_2006:_Coast_2_Coast"},"16936":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony Bend","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ae7ea273-6ba3-46e2-a44c-d5720dd7d8b5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2403350f-0486-411e-a5ed-d411cf5059ff.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ebbcf034-e7f0-4587-8e60-50f3f4427eee.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"31c9a720-d671-46c8-8b9a-bc93c0a45d75.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d6528d0e-32b8-458b-81ff-1ec64acdf11e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8820a233-29f8-41a6-98ff-8ce551179359.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a3ed740-6226-4a9a-9706-88a86f78ca70.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6d4b564e-b664-4e55-8f49-bfd94814e4d9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"97e3d436-930f-4255-8690-9e96b6f93559.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"17e29dd5-3e7e-487d-a2ca-983a3cefb2b2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c69e9da6-6945-4e4c-bb3e-f779194628e8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4a5564c2-6011-4e54-92e6-55e720c02d36.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"83336f7d-ffa3-4b47-a0ac-17bbab845070.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":8,"Name":"Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror","Overview":"Assume the role of Gabe Logan, a highly-trained Precision Strike Operative, commanding a black box United States Agency that legally doesn't exist.

The player is James Grayson, a former British Marine. Grayson finds his brother infected by the Chimera virus and goes on to destroy every conversion centre he can find. The Maquis enlist Grayson, and it's his job to retake Europe from the Chimera. The game is presented as a third-person shooter and makes use of a cover system that allows the player to hide behind objects. While hiding from Chimera, Grayson is able to pop out quickly and attack the enemy. Covers are locked automatically when Grayson goes near them and aiming assistance is also provided.\n\nPlayers who own a copy of Resistance 2 and play Resistance: Retribution on a PSP 2000 or 3000 can connect the AV output to a television to play the game with a DualShock 3 controller. Also when owning both games, they can be linked using a USB cable to open up the Infected mode. It provides an alternate history, mixing events of the two games. Grayson is recruited by Specter Lieutenant David LaSalle (from Resistance 2) and is infected with a mutated version of the Chimeran virus. In this game mode, Grayson wears a Specter uniform and has glowing Chimeran eyes. He can regenerate health, gets access to new weapons and breathes underwater. He is also able to reach hidden passages and pick up intel, unlocking plasma grenades and even a further expanded story. This game mode ends when the game is quit and progress cannot be saved.\n\nMultiplayer consists of battles through Ad Hoc and Infrastructure with statistics tracking on MyResistance.net. The included game modes are deathmatch, team deathmatch, containment, capture the flag and assimilation.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Resistance:_Retribution"},"17876":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Disney-Pixar Toy Story 3"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalanche Software","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"fc93700b-3400-4c19-bfee-13572ac85b52.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b26a9213-9e29-4314-9aa3-481077d955a8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4757db8a-2bc3-4e9b-b3f8-aa1240fc09b3.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d6e8cfc1-4fbe-4864-bc7d-a60aa2a68712.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fe5be043-c568-4868-9fee-454bf64bc344.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"514eb393-afbe-4576-88bc-f4ab2e977337.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"079a68e3-d056-4d41-b83b-a87eefbea08b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Toy Story 3","Overview":"UNLEASH your IMAGINATION\n\nStory Mode: Dive into heroic adventures from the Toy Story 3 movie\n\nExciting Mini-Adventures: Help Buzz battle Zurg or team up with Sheriff Woody to protect his town!","Publisher":"Disney","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RRI8IuNGhlY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Toy_Story_3:_The_Video_Game"},"17877":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rockstar Leeds","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"827bc289-584b-41d6-9e85-b12cc374d505.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4409d2f2-2ad9-44aa-91b8-2e06a0612eaa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a54369db-0a30-4be1-962c-cd8aec9b121c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9d128e35-f23b-47c9-aa4d-4a96d44d261c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e6579897-967a-469f-8fc0-f93dbbdc0a1c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b422f15-004e-4667-93bd-2c6e69ae4c71.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"7aed7026-e14a-47a8-aa08-fa8c11a16427.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b6df5f5b-74a3-44a0-9408-60f8ac36ca4c.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"aadf9de5-5d2e-4a70-af9e-98df56aefdf4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5e21a4ba-65e8-4f8a-b3d2-e91bbfd10253.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9dd044f7-df1f-4160-823f-56e11fa72e87.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"330e99cc-0955-4739-ab69-404b413a0287.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition","Overview":"The series that took racing from the tracks to the open urban streets is raising the stakes even higher.

It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship . The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode. In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes. In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races. The plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit. Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules. Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy. Story mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints. There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis. There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney\/Pixar animated short series \"Cars Toons\" that center around the character Mater. These include \"Mater the Greater\", \"El Materdor\", and \"Tokyo Mater\". While racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time. Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase. There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly. You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=16nb72Q3v_0"},"17881":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Nickelodeon SpongeBob SquarePants: The Yellow Avenger"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tantalus","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"43af42cf-4599-4ece-99c6-78795897ef8f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fe7bdb57-72a1-44ef-bb16-57f2f646ced4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1deeb279-1f83-45cc-961f-42cdd701245c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9e3fe3a7-41fc-4b06-b69a-b21e6f06fcb6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d4e1f30-bcbf-4ed7-9de3-5eef14fdbc9b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f61c11a2-ce24-441f-bb64-9459a636cc80.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"73adae52-c00d-4387-81f9-9b29a9f35746.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8ae4003c-7a40-4d1e-b9bf-3b8f350965a7.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Spongebob Squarepants: The Yellow Avenger","Overview":"SpongeBob's favourite superheroes, Mermaidman and Barnacleboy, are in some serious trouble!

It turns out that Eggman Nega (once again masquerading as Doctor Eggman) has stolen the Chao and concealed them inside a haunted mansion. His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the \"Ifrit\" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit's world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it.\nMeanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way.\n\nAll of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble.\n\nSonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future. Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client's advanced payment on late rental fees.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BYh_HLAvfl4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sonic_Rivals_2"},"18039":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"High Voltage Software","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"eea9a6e9-1918-458e-9d59-059ada25e2e3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9c34d1a2-cffc-4ee4-94a1-b6e5c235bc8b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ff53e93c-0f6b-440f-b71b-65ce042c2d3b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f62dd52d-caaf-47db-b2f8-7ff522322cc4.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70f84b8c-79e5-4a58-accc-8b398950d19e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0610a3e5-06c4-46fc-b4d4-85c6bc789028.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6dd49277-9ab0-44f7-8f64-4cb6c458b45c.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"13ee9c2d-0395-48b0-b667-ac505f03ff93.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"50 Cent: Bulletproof: G Unit Edition","Overview":"After getting shot nine times and left for dead, 50 takes revenge on his enemies.

For full arcade effect you can see the scoreboard reflected on the table glass and hear arcade background noises, including sound effects from classic videogames like Galaga.\n\nEach table also comes with instructions on the main features of the table and a smidgen of history. There are other historical artifacts, such as a still photo tour of the Gottlieb factory (a feature which must be unlocked).\n\nThe complete list of tables is: Play-Boy (1932), Ace High (1954), Central Park (1966), Big Shot (1973), Genie (1979), Black Hole (1981), Goin' Nuts (1983), El Dorado City of Gold (1984), Victory (1987), and Tee'd Off (1993), Strikes N’ Spares (1995).

He needs to get behind enemy lines and prevent Hitler from deploying the V2 rocket, with the help of US troopers. The story is told through briefings with still voices and narrated voice-overs.\n\nNext to the classic first-person shooting gameplay true to the series, the Wii version offers a new, more accessible mode with on-rails shooting - the computer handles the movement while players only need to aim and shoot. In the regular mode, players move around with the analog stick, look around with the Wii remote, lean with the Nunchuk and fire with the B-button, a departure from the control system introduced in Medal of Honor: Vanguard. The game also offers a lock-on system with the Z-button. Alternately, players can use the Wii Zapper to aim and shoot.\n\nThe regular combat remains, but much more events have been added with a few mini-games thrown in. For instance, players need to twist the Wii remote to tune a radio for mid-game incoming information and the sound comes through the remote's speaker. Other quirks require the player to raise the Nunchuk to pump the shotgun. Players need to plant charges (twist the Wii remote like a timer), pick up documents and man various stationary guns. This version also marks the return of the sniper rifle and adds bazookas and mortars.\n\nUp to 32 players can simultaneously join a single match, with game modes such as Death Match, Team Death Match and Infiltration. Multiplayer maps are adaptations of the single-player levels.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Medal_of_Honor:_Heroes_2"},"18933":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Slant Six Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fbe80e12-90c9-4e94-be8b-fa37d13f7c7e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"08e4e460-56b1-4303-a85c-d88b8a2f04e6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"22355306-cb04-42c8-9fc0-ab9c61d8a6cc.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2d85eab5-1f13-49ac-b438-3f392fab4bbd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"00902d64-0423-4455-94ea-119836d70f03.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4384c6b1-6c65-4849-bf03-30f59e9acbf5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"a4fbd6ba-0bed-4c23-84fe-4d532bf96854.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"26ddd924-9415-4744-99ba-eb835d1d21e5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5b1a467b-fd4b-4724-8819-12bab0d37776.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"657b0092-30fd-478c-b9be-09060d353979.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs: Tactical Strike","Overview":"Tactical Strike is the third hand-held game in the long-line of the SOCOM series. This one differs from its console cousins. Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.\n\nThe story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as \"La Mano Los Gente\" -- though it is worth noting that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as \"The Hand The People,\" because the \"de\" is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two diplomats.\n\nThe gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper, or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to show what trajectory it will follow.\n\nThere are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18934":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Call of Duty Roads to Victory","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Amaze Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9c637226-d0e4-4b12-a2e3-ed6b95285dfa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6f04a242-cf61-402f-a5d2-e49b24d63717.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7c9486c3-49c3-4159-8c25-9d4f253ad7d3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d1344876-592d-42b8-9631-24a03582f2e0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a513c310-51e3-4114-9291-c4f428f9aefd.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49a1dbe8-feac-467b-adb1-8797198bc86a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bd7c91be-6654-42c8-97ab-d39bad62c299.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c149d6e7-1814-4347-a0ff-b45c02a4a5bd.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d6dd8594-63da-4483-afcd-64fcd45c0970.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"eedae456-47c0-40a3-8900-14bd689dc5f6.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":6,"Name":"Call of Duty: Roads to Victory","Overview":"Call of Duty: Roads to Victory is the first game in Call of Duty series for PlayStation Portable.

This gets him in a lot of trouble with the other gangs, and the story, divided over 6 chapters, is presented in comic-book style.\n\nThere are 27 missions, set in New York, from New Jersey to Coney Island, with several distinguishable districts, and over 40 customizable vehicles, from dirt bikes to sports cars and big rigs, and some surprises such as the Ghostbusters' Ecto-1 - all with different handling. Players have complete freedom to move about, but the mission structure is linear. Tasks include time-limited runs, escorting and evading missions. Ray can also move on foot, and wreak havoc with a number of guns, along with locked targetting.\n\nDuring the main game the characters can accept side jobs to earn additional cash, such as closed-course or open-road racing, driving a tow-truck, a taxi or an ambulance, and money can be spend in the garage to upgrade the vehicles.\n\nMultiplayer is supported for up to 2 players over WiFi with Street Racing, Carnage, Circuit Racing, Pink Slip Racing and Swap Meet.

The basic gameplay premise reminds of the GTA series but instead of a free roaming experience the campaign consists of 70 short missions which are chosen through a menu screen. Every of them is accompanied with a story sequence in a comic style and features varied goals: escorting, infiltrating an enemy post, stealing cars, kidnapping people, racing, defending the own position against enemy waves and killing people.\n\nThe gameplay itself offers what one would expect from a game like this: if the player is on foot the game is basically a third person shooter - sometimes he has a few other gang members with him and can give them a few commands. The driving is action oriented in either first or third person and the stealth segments are basic and require only to perceive the guard's patrols and kill them from behind. The police intervenes if they see a crime but there is no wanted system like in similar games. At the beginning of the campaign the player has a choice between five gangs with different abilities, e.g. the Triads can drive faster.\n\nAdditionally the game features a big selection of playing modes and mini games, e.g. free roaming in London, driving taxi, photographing points of interests as tourist or fighting off zombies. The mini games in the pub can be played with two players: darts, bowling, pool and a Snake variant as arcade machine, The last noteworthy mode is a tactical game similar to Risk: The player takes control over a crime organization and tries to conquer London which is divided into about 30 districts. In every round he can perform three actions, e.g. move men to another district. Between rounds he can hire more men or acquire bonus cards which give certain advantages. There are three difficulty levels and several winning conditions for this mode.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=op27kMwyYQM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gangs_of_London_(video_game)"},"19366":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"High Voltage Software","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"60bf500f-9a0d-47d9-ae89-95475073dda2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dd0f1ccd-6de6-44fb-adea-01daeebbdd85.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"da62f784-d7f3-4c05-808b-de4e6d119931.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"62f8c83f-b7ef-401b-adac-6348a6daded4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b51e13f1-b883-40c9-8036-4fad58cd1b89.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1878d30f-34ed-406d-8280-6d4c8454778f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"65b759e7-518b-48a0-b381-13d5fdc55d4d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e6c28547-31f6-4409-bb11-989b657cb051.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2","Overview":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 builds off of the events in the first game and places gamers in control of the U.S. military's elite fighting unit, the Ghosts.

Over the course of the game they will return to many locations from the movies and meet returning characters as well as some new locations and characters.\n\nAs the Rookie the player must explore levels to find and capture any ghosts while being assisted by fellow Ghostbusters following you. A ghost must first be weakened using any of the proton pack weapon modes it is vulnerable to, then by dragging the stunned ghost to a trap placed by the player or their teammates. Other enemy types must be defeated by first revealing a weak point and then pulling it out with the proton pack's blast stream, or by simply dealing enough damage to the enemy. If the Rookie takes too much damage themselves they will be knocked unconscious, and their allies will attempt to get to them and help them back up. The Rookie can do the same if any of their allies are knocked unconscious, and if all current members of the team are knocked down the game will return to the last checkpoint. Information about enemies and objects in the world can be obtained by scanning them, and concept art for the entries can be added by finding hidden pages in the levels. The Rookie receives upgrades to their proton pack automatically over the course of the game, and by finding enough scanner entries they can increase their health.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Atari","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0M1DFujoyB4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ghostbusters:_The_Video_Game"},"19369":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"罪恶装备XXAC加强版","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"aa48a2ee-0da1-48c0-9ede-4d31b2fc2667.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9e4ae9fc-7913-43eb-92a4-8047e3470581.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9229b948-4d03-4d7a-9266-596a5500216d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6b38eade-67fd-4abd-b1a6-8fd05b611ab8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"85f05b82-85c5-4ac1-b557-71f711b0620d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a1d57be7-2b24-4b78-95db-b7e2d1e7b1d7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a41bef3b-e98f-45f2-8a97-ebe33cd766a8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c098a927-82a4-4c11-a5c8-ca453c5915df.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"ff1cbc4b-35bd-498c-b548-03beb9e424b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5e231d7c-7863-4617-87aa-9879d2da6856.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus","Overview":"The fighting franchise that launched an entirely new style of fighting games is celebrating its 10th anniversary with the most complete and definitive version of the game on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo Wii.

The general storyline is the same, as it is set in 1939 just before World War II begins. Indiana Jones is in search of the Staff of Moses, even though that is not the main quest until halfway through the game. It starts in a Mayan ruin where Charles Kingston takes Jones to the resting place of the jade sphere, a Mayan astronomy guide. Another colleague, Magnus Völler, strikes out on his own and quickly runs into trouble. The sphere becomes a bone of contention when the story picks up a few years later when Jones is in San Francisco. He receives a call from Archie Tan who is hunted down by the Chinese who also hold his granddaughter Suzy captive. Jones has to infiltrate Chinatown and rescue both. The sphere then brings him to Panama and eventually also Nepal. The importance of the Staff of Moses is only gradually revealed, as well as Magnus Völler as the main villain.\n\nThe game consists of a series of very different action sequences with scripted events, a lot of fighting and minor elements of puzzle solving. Generally Indy is able to fight melee combat using a number of punches and combos, use a pistol and a whip, and manipulate the environment. Many items such as bottles, spears or chairs can be picked up to be used as weapons, while certain items also need to be manipulated to retrieve clues, open valves or lower platforms. Often there are maze-like level layouts and a limited time frame to complete them.\n\nThere are hidden artifacts to collect, and a number of primary and secondary goals that provide Glory and Fortune points. These can be spent to upgrade Indy's abilities (such as additional health, stronger defence or tougher punches) or to unlock concept art or cheats.","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HTC8UqzdtdA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Staff_of_Kings"},"19373":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Bandai Games Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2292dc93-71c2-46ae-943e-71d6ce1dec0b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"96ec55e5-ea83-4860-9090-9727e557fcc9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fd83c040-3109-425f-92c3-80006d1e73ca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"85dd7d1a-cc6d-4f0f-a8eb-2234c4da6d15.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"335ffa54-92ae-4fad-b952-cb7f93a05619.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a422ea6-44e5-49c1-b303-074d1907f762.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be0f60eb-b47d-4f60-827e-e9b05dc4e64f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b43cfa8e-b032-4f14-8d39-930df64f8330.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"10a3b0a4-c60a-4e95-9fb9-99261a3a2bc6.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":8,"Name":"MotoGP","Overview":"MotoGP is a motorcycle racing game based on the 2005 MotoGP season.

It has the same basic storyline, though some cutscenes and much of the dialogue within have been expanded or modified in other ways. Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling hook at specific points.\n\nPuzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new \"adrenaline dodge\" ability, which slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an \"enraged\" state. Some cutscenes require the player to participate in quick-time events.","Publisher":"Eidos","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tomb_Raider:_Anniversary"},"19379":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kuju Surrey","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"b2b73abd-1d4f-4908-9581-545c3c521997.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"78b645b4-e0bc-49b8-9109-f46364d2a6a9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ff40e67e-87e5-4cbf-8490-be2706ac1c18.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b93523aa-5f78-48f2-928e-ed6eb4030514.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"402c8322-d045-4aad-a3be-e190000c1a8a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1ab706e4-f2dd-4eb9-8b62-f7ccf3af8dfd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6f024cc-cd11-41ed-ba6b-8beafb2c8f5a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6eed6431-f56e-424e-860e-6983a9b0b16d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"91ce9fcf-9729-4ef5-9d2d-34901477b984.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"aa6c162b-d9bf-4780-8e5a-dbd7a8417b23.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"778e71c5-6d14-45b6-929f-0a4c32598d94.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"10549104-9dc2-4dca-a595-c4a4450ac272.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":8,"Name":"M.A.C.H.: Modified Air Combat Heroes","Overview":"Welcome to the world of M.A.C.H.

The player controls the car on the track and tries to complete the stages in fastest possible time. Since rally is driven so that the track is clear of other cars, competitors are shown as ghost cars. Co-drivers notes are both spoken and shown on the screen to aid in navigating the often twisty stages.\n\nGame can be played in Quick Rally, Time Trial, Single Rally, Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Rally selects a random car and rally stage to race. In Time Trial, a ghost car is shown on the track and the player's goal is to beat its time on that stage. In Single Rally mode, player chooses the team and car to drive with and needs to complete all the stages in a single rally. Other drivers are shown as ghost cars.\n\nChampionship mode extends the Single Rally mode into full season of 16 rallies. Each rally has two to four stages and the player must reach certain position in order to advance to the next stage. Difficulty level (novice, professional, expert, extreme) defines the number of stages per rally and the required finishing position. Expert and extreme levels are unlocked by completing the preceding level. After each rally, points are awarded to top 8 drivers and the championship is won by most points at the end of the season. Completing championship modes also unlocks new car types and rally stages for other play modes.\n\nMultiplayer modes include both offline (hot-seat) and online play. The hot-seat rallies are for up to four players and allow the players to compete in Time Trial, Single Rally, and Championship modes. Online wireless play allows up to eight players to race together on a single stage. As in other modes, competitors are shown as ghost cars.\n\nThe game has an arcade-style control scheme (no manual gear changes for example) and a simple damage model. Damaging the car has visual impact on the car and on expert and extreme levels, damage affects the car performance too. PSP WRC supports downloadable content, like custom avatars for the player.","Publisher":"SCEE","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Rally_Championship_(2005_video_game)"},"19385":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pilot ni Narou!

All aircraft names and designs are licensed.\n\nIn the initial lessons, the game teaches the player the basics of powered flight for both civilian and military purposes. The game uses all PSP buttons to deliver a flight simulation feel with the analog nub serving as a joystick. Controlling the flaps, air brakes, raising and lowering the landing gear as well as using the tail rudder are also possible. Military aircraft feature air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air-missiles, a machine gun and flares for self defense against missiles. The only thing missing from the simulation is a fuel gauge, but since most missions are rather short, this was probably a deliberate design choice. \n\nAfter civilian and military flight lessons are completed, the player is free to choose from various missions and challenges. Completing a task successfully unlocks new aircraft in the player's hangar which can then be flown any time in free flight mode (but only on the tropical map). Distinctions are also awarded for completion of a mission based on time taken, aircraft integrity, completion of objectives and level of excitement\/comfort of passengers (if any) and determine the level of proficiency of the player pilot.\n\nFlights take place over different types of terrain including tropical, desert, snow covered mountains and canyons and in varying weather conditions like rain, snow and even in a storm. Some missions begin while already airborne, while others require the player to taxi onto the runway, takeoff and land after completing the objective. \n\nMultiplayer supports up to four players dogfighting against each other or cooperatively with planes from any of the four military eras, e.g. a dogfight between a WWII propeller plane like the P-51 Mustang or the Spitfire versus an F-14 Tomcat or F-16 Falcon is possible.","Publisher":"Rising Star Games","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9OLyb0kCkxs"},"19386":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Piratas del Caribe: El cofre del hombre muerto","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Amaze Entertainment","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"26bab8f2-400f-4c42-afa2-64120ebc06bd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"39fc5136-a8d5-4d63-b743-29b97f722b08.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"facd8111-af2d-4791-8996-48c0e581f00a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cc64c543-d32c-4cda-8f44-51c1f54c5dcf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"54ecbe51-6f1f-4f58-8c4f-51bfb2dce970.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fca29a1c-63e6-4e6c-b876-7e5d286093ae.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c5307298-9ea1-487e-9d27-3ccfa67fc184.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"562e3f79-ceeb-4a1e-a048-45ed1b0f8de2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"206c418a-6333-444f-9e5e-33d19af87b79.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"94a97cdd-6449-497a-835c-b61a34d4f11d.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest","Overview":"Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man’s Chest is a swashbuckling action-adventure for the Sony PSP.

Cities are in chaos as the regular police is helpless. Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.\n\nYour task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.\n\nYou can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.","Publisher":"SCE","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gWGWCf1gTaU"},"19392":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"BigBig Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"7b25cc3e-0b80-4454-adab-8f5e8cdfeab3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e378c0fd-2fd4-4fd1-9020-ce49d72433fd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2050f869-8ca2-4246-b09b-4f35ea930b18.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7148aa86-a71a-4a98-b358-a8d2ad2615a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c435fb8-c6e8-4409-ac23-86e5fb50d647.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice","Overview":"Extreme Justice is the sequel to Pursuit Force and this time the player has to take down five different gangs terrorizing Capital City.

But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.\n\nDuring the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.\n\nThe game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19400":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"DreamWorks Shrek: Smash n' Crash Racing"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Torus Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"df330985-ce12-4ac2-ace0-87c917affb3e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b5d4245a-5018-4482-a693-8d973655f519.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a6313aa-595c-4d23-a8d4-ab50f19fadd7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a60ad2bb-f279-428b-bf90-ee881b7f082d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"63caea41-e53e-46a9-ae37-95011db731cc.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"Name":"Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing","Overview":"Shrek Smash N' Crash Racing has you racing through 12 environments with gameplay similar to Mario Kart, but set in the Shrek universe.

Unlike the console version with its open-world design, the PSP game is strictly linear. Spider-Man must make his way through 19 levels, each presenting him with a series of challenges. He must beat up thugs and robots, save a police car from dropping from a bridge, turn on the sprinkler system in a burning warehouse, carry away civilians from a failed fusion experiment, rescue hostages in a museum and much more. Spidey can swing from buildings, pull himself up to the ceiling and crawl on walls to get around. To defeat the many enemies, he can use a variety of kicks and punches which can be built up into combos. His webbing comes into play in various ways: he can shoot it at enemies to knock them out temporarily and must also use it to complete various objectives, like fixing leaky pipes for the sprinkling system. During the game, Spidey earns Hero Points, which can be spent after each level to unlock new moves and some bonuses. Hero Points are awarded for completing a level, using combos, high levels of health and webbing remaining, time used and secret spider symbols found.\n\nThe game follows the story of the film only loosely (in the levels concerning Doctor Octopus). Many other Spider-Man villains are featured and must be defeated, including Mysterio, the Rhino, the Shocker and the Vulture. The story is told through a mixture of pre-rendered and in-game cutscenes, for which film actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina and JK Simmons reprise their roles.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2005-03-25T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19406":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Spider-Man: El Reino de las Sombras","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Shaba Games","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"56338a9f-a9c3-46de-9852-2dafd32ef1c4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7b4df3fa-442b-433f-98e7-c730658b7b5b.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ec3f8036-f745-424b-91c8-8d2e30cddba0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7d9e88c-1e79-4fde-becd-e6fc5dfdf249.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2105f74b-7a6b-4a83-824d-d9ac3a530bcb.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc7244a1-a288-4276-b123-3a8e65fd7934.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fbf9dbbb-d9c2-48b0-acbb-4d88082a85f9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"50ad4749-8b5f-4d66-b683-d36d15f8ccf8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8ac950e7-1548-4d84-864f-8fb93b8c823a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"9795f230-9eb9-4702-860c-cf3fefb4f673.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spider-Man Web of Shadows: Amazing Allies Edition","Overview":"Spider-Man: Web of Shadows - Amazing Allies Edition is a 2D side-scroller with 3D graphics.

Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara's past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden.\n\nThe typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip.\n\nEnemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades.

In addition, they can equip various ninja tools and techniques for the characters to use. The techniques include long-lasting effects, such as Lee's Eight Gates and Karin's Mind's Eye of the Kagura. The feature to have three allies with you allows the performance of \"team attacks\", which include the four standing in a square formation and knocking the enemy around and finishing with each performing one of their techniques, resulting in an explosion. \n\nThe player can call any of the three allied characters to perform a technique on their enemy, resulting in the gaining of Kizuna Points. The higher the amount of Kizuna Points when the mission is finished, the higher the rank you receive on it. Kizuna Points can also be used to revive fallen allies and, if the player falls, an ally will immediately go to revive them if there is enough Kizuna Points. Kizuna Points can also be gained by performing team attacks. \n\nThe game features many challenges. The main challenges are battles with false tailed beasts. The three that appear are the One-Tail, the Two-Tails and the Nine-Tails. Though they are considerably smaller than the real thing, they posses the same abilities and some unnamed, game-only attacks. Perhaps the greatest challenge is fighting the Three-Headed Guardian Beast, a huge, lion-like monster with power equivalent to that of a real tailed beast. \n\nThe graphics of the game have been greatly improved since the previous games.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games America","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19521":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Kenka Banchō 3: Zenkoku Seiha","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Bullets","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"247aa4bd-e42b-4b8f-b089-42c0a251fd70.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e3481467-825a-4ff1-8e20-ed4ebc4aa57b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a015caa7-6630-4c02-9d45-6827c94e7424.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2ec6902-5aeb-41ab-bf82-6bfa9cf4e4a4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0b8fcc03-3ed7-4b04-b031-2ebd8da02988.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4eab9980-3368-40a4-a43d-8f762a0d4b8c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"79b75d76-a3f1-42c0-8795-8d4d9edbb76e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"757ba83e-1620-4580-a302-6194ff4ae03d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5a1aceee-b697-4212-b8d5-d90aae7064f8.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble","Overview":"As the toughest student in a Japanese high school, it's up to you to prove your badassitude when all the schools in the nation get together for a week-long learning excursion in the historic (and fictional) city of Kyouto.

The plot is set in feudal age Japan, and revolves around a group of ninjas and assassins who get involved into the kidnapping of Lord Gohda's single daughter, Princess Kiku. The game's protagonists are Rikkimaru and Ayame (both ninjas of the Azuma clan, working for Lord Gohda), Rin (a renegade ninja of the Beniya clan), and Tesshu (a medical doctor who works as a hired assassin at night). All four characters' campaigns can be selected right from the start. Each character's campaign encompasses eight missions.\n\nThe gameplay is once again based on the stealth-action genre's fundamental premise of completing the mission goals with being discovered as few times as possible, since the player characters are hopelessly outnumbered by the enemy guards. When the player approaches an unsuspecting enemy from behind, he can perform a stealth kill, which kills the target instantly without risking a fight.\n\nMission objectives vary from getting to a certain location on the map, taking out a certain target, to escorting NPCs to a designated area. A distance sensor indicates how great the distance is between the player and the closest enemy, but not the direction in which the enemy is. It also shows whether the enemy is aware of the players presence. As usual for the series, the player is free choose between several weapons and gadgets, which he obtains as reward for completing mission. The better the ranking he receives after the missions, the more and better items he receives.\n\nGadgets include throwing knifes, poisonous rice, healing potions, smoke bombs, grenades and many more. Aside from these optional accessories the player always has a trusty grappling hook at his disposal, which can be used to climb houses and ledges.\n\nThe game also features a mission editor to create story-driven single player missions, as well as multiplayer missions. The multiplayer mode can be played competitively and cooperatively with 2 players.","Publisher":"SEGA Europe Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tenchu:_Time_of_the_Assassins"},"19670":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Harry Potter y el Caliz de Fuego","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA UK","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f4b63666-e463-4ee2-8150-27a464f09585.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"79fcb327-b1e6-4718-ba96-9e9ee686e9b1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c1b684f7-4185-4269-b1a5-1ae6bcb10006.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eb4057c4-4391-40a9-a610-e65b3b4b8901.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f9f044fa-bd30-4672-aaaa-0ad1431403e6.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7bac7dc1-2c76-4bc3-8cc9-07819c9160cb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d6b3e2d2-b3dd-4e52-a279-018760bcecd2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a58cef37-87ab-411f-9a11-5f6f3b25b028.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"4f58b768-8f39-4a88-9489-2ed0b6b33328.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9aeaf2c2-df69-4424-b3ad-642df8d731f1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"53e7b246-e90b-4cb0-9606-80b701f2133b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ccae8b19-df3f-401d-ae44-0a2b853352e4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"50c4dac4-2470-48c8-9586-dcbeefd8f307.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","Overview":"Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire continues that adventures of Harry Potter.

This game is not a direct port from PlayStation 2 release. New features have been added while others were removed to make the game appropriate for its new portable form. For example, there are item boxes used as global deposits allowing to store items and access them any time without entering \"home\".\n\nThe game features most elements from its predecessor, and you still need to fulfil missions - hunt monsters, gather materials and use them to create better equipment. Unlike the original game in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 all missions can be finished solo. The game world has also been expanded and now includes more unique territories for players to explore.\n\nMultiplayer is still limited to Ad-Hoc, but the game features online downloadable quests which often provide special materials that can create bonus equipment impossible to create otherwise.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q0n8VGIZnjM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monster_Hunter_Freedom_2"},"20081":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SCE San Diego Studio","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7a8b30df-412f-4960-afbf-78fe8ec689d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"814ec440-773e-44ca-b04d-a4ed858c9380.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"39616c19-0702-4e55-bd1c-0887c7af69d9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e6661cf3-f7e1-4f32-99f8-e983be9541ad.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pinball Heroes","Overview":"Classic arcade pinball action in the palm of your hands.

However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1980, 1902 and 1580—as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarette; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.\n\nGiven a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarette or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's stone, to resurrect his mother.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2010-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shadow_of_Memories"},"20349":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Left Field Productions","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"21912647-cf30-4762-b02e-77cbf27ddc06.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3060ae6e-d247-4dcf-b486-e23fdcbc6e9a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18d4a1e9-b112-416a-b181-5073ce95614a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"384be1ca-65f3-4864-b7b1-362512f6bf18.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a8398bf9-c4d1-45c2-abbd-eb558a95874c.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dave Mirra BMX Challenge","Overview":"Dave Mirra is to BMX what Edison was to electricity.

For the twelve episodes of the new season, they hire the player to be one of the eighth drivers and perhaps even become the next champion. It is an arcade-focused racing game with fake-named sport cars inspired by real-world cars. But instead of just racing around the tracks and trying to be first just by driving better, everyone has access to a power play bar. By doing drifts, drafting (driving in the slipstream of another car), jumping or avoiding an activated power play, the three sections of the bar fill up. While the first two are used to activate two level one power plays, filling up the third gives the player access to a level two power play.\n\nBesides the normal races the game features several other game modes like Destruction in which the player has to get to the finish line as fast as possible while every power play on the track is automatically triggered.

Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates.\n\nAs you unlock games in Academy Mode, you can begin to play them in the \"Mini-game Collection\". Here, you can choose from available mini-games, and play them as you wish to become better at them.

It is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis project and, although not having much to do with Final Fantasy XIII, shares its mythology.\n\nThe game is a RPG in which the characters travel to get missions and attack enemy strongholds to complete them. In each mission, three characters out of 14 are selected, each having their own style, weapons and abilities. The battle system is an Active System Battle (ATB) that allows the control of many characters, Characters who were KO'd in battle must be revived in town before being used again. Each character have a unique summon that can be used for 5 minutes in battle and can be levelled-up. The ATB kai, as it is called, allows for up to three players to connect via ad-hoc and send each other emergency back-up.\n\nFinal Fantasy: Type-0 is set in the world of Orience, divided in four kingdoms: the Suzaku Fiefdom of Rubrum, the Milites Empire, the Lorican Alliance, and the Kingdom of Concordia, each having its own emblem based on four Japanese mythological beasts: the phoenix Suzaku, the Turtle Genbu, the tiger Byakko and the dragon Seiryuu. Every kingdom is in possession of a crystal that an mark humans as their servants, called l'Cie. Character growth is based on the Alto Crystarium system, using energy called phantoma to increase the character's abilities.\n\nThe later released PC, PS4 and Xbox One versions are called Final Fantasy: Type-0 HD. They are available worldwide instead of the Japan-only PSP version. The content is almost completely identical, with a focus on localization and improvised visuals. It does not have the multiplayer functionality of the PSP version, but adds additional difficulty levels.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QfbeXCoBx48&t=177s","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Final_Fantasy_Type-0"},"21073":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai Namco Games","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"36a1e322-f0d0-4852-b02b-d201fbd9a7f2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7b1105a4-d0e2-4aee-95cb-810ca238a41c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0cbb4b06-a9af-4196-9ecb-064265a29ecc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Idolm@ster: Shiny Festa: Funky Note","Overview":"The Idolmaster Shiny Festa is a series of three Japanese rhythm video games developed and published by Bandai Namco Games.

The better you do here, the more power you will have to fight with for the Battle Phase. In this phase, you alternate between Attacking (similar to Charge Phase), and Guarding (press the appropriate buttons as they appear on-screen to block attacks.) Success in these two phases will lead you into the Final Phase, where you must finish off your enemy.\n\nGitaroo Man Lives! is also compatible with Ad Hoc Mode for multiplayer play.

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.","Publisher":"NIS America","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tCKh3azvgW0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phantom_Brave"},"21431":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Shirokishi Monogatari Episode Portable: Dogma Wars","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Matrix Software","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"3fb58f24-e475-4d65-9f4b-fe801a47a4a9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3a687e6b-9aca-4b48-b51a-507ff5ca9b26.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0b00507e-465d-4694-9314-ac7cbf7f20f1.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7accedf4-6570-4574-8209-186b929e9c72.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f7fde705-bae1-4431-9f4d-be3948e8c05a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"721da7b3-b491-4489-9394-7942dddb74c1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f5573f7-db0c-43e5-ae43-a4b5f449fc53.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d7711c0a-7083-4fe5-97a5-04cdf3b02e9d.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"White Knight Chronicles: Origins","Overview":"10,000 years before the original PS3 game takes place, there was a period of strife known as the Dogma Wars.

It is based on the free-to-play online title PangYa, and features nine courses, all taken from the PC title. There are a few differences from normal golf, however: players can use a variety of items and special abilities to give their shots properties impossible in real life; and skillful playing will accrue a currency called Pang, which can be used to purchase items, equipment, some of the hundreds of outfits, or even gamble a bit for super-rare items.\n\nThe primary focus of the game is the Story Mode, where the player takes the role of many of the 18 unlockable characters through a story involving a mysterious boy named Kaz and various nefarious elements that mean harm to Pangya Island. There is also the Pangya Tour mode, which includes two elements: License mode sees the player completing a variety of challenges on each course to earn licenses, after which the player can participate in Tournament Mode, where 9 and 18-hole tournaments are played for valuable prizes.

This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode.\n\nAt the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol.

The object is to eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, unless you eat a power pellet, which gives you the ability to eat the ghosts for a few seconds.\n\nWhat's new here is many different mazes and modes. This is designed from the ground up as a console game, so some arcade traditions are lost. The object is no longer to try to survive\/get a high score without losing quarters, but to get a high score in a set time limit. You do still have a set number of lives, which makes your time end early if you lose all them.\n\nUnlike the original or its prodigy, Championship Edition isn't broken into distinct levels. Once you clear one side of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side. Eating the fruit regenerates the empty half with new walls, dots, power pellets, etc and increases the game speed.\n\nThe look is a bright neon which evokes the classic Pac-Man but takes advantage of nearly 30 years of increased computer power.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lnJ9Op7c_w4"},"23889":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Image Epoch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d571bcfb-4883-4daf-8ec2-61d36f9aa79c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"da5dd2a2-1bbb-4649-86e4-bb933c9a3875.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Criminal Girls","Overview":"In Criminal Girls, the player takes the role of a prison warden in Hell who has been assigned to a group of seven girls. Although these seven have all been damned to Hell for their sins in life, they qualify for an early release program in which they must climb a tower to earn a second chance in the realm of the living. However, they are defiant and rebellious, not wanting to do what they're told. The player must therefore whip the girls into shape, sometimes literally, in order to help them complete their rehabilitation. On their way up the tower, the girls must fight other prisoners in RPG-style battles.\n\nOne of the main gameplay mechanics is Motivation, through which the girls learn new skills, gain the will to fight, and come to terms with their sins. It plays out as a minigame in which the player uses items such as whips and shock devices to destroy \"temptations\" that appear on the screen, after which they can cuddle with the girl. The minigame is accompanied by images of the chosen girl in suggestive poses.","Publisher":"Nippon Ichi Software","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TRxTSX34UDs"},"23893":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dimps","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"f9e3d93b-c954-454b-af1c-dd3f87ce7750.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"66775167-3f34-4496-9188-64c400325da2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0c7744e0-67d3-4d4a-a1ba-3e8e3569cb05.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"89449bf1-1a5e-42b4-9804-3d972ae1fad5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0ed85e31-75f2-444f-a196-ef397a0b7f58.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"611d967d-4386-4be5-9904-276401e204af.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15454fca-869e-4aa4-966a-6341b03f8325.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb2ff2e0-2772-46dd-9974-8c0a08d8cb77.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3434d41f-b3b1-4a00-90af-3f6ae9ece947.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"15d6d530-222b-4405-b358-4196361158fe.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai","Overview":"The game's story mode is based on the events of the movie Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn.

When they killed Herbert Friedman, the conductor of the biological experiment with the black flowers, they assumed everything was okay, of course it was not. The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare. The only ones that really know what is going on are the ones that are experiencing it for the second time and hide terrible secrets inside themselves...\n\nMost of the time you take control over two of the six available characters. Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates. Mei is instead a hacker and knows how to hack access panels. You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team.\n\nBut their wits alone can't save them from their doom so they also find several different weapons ranging from melee-weapons like a baseball bat to pistols and other weapons with a serious punch. You can also pick up chairs and tables to throw at your enemies. Early in the game you also gain a syringe with which you take samples off the dead creature-bodies. Once the syringe is full you can use it to gain a temporary boost of your abilities.\n\nAs a multiplayer-treat the game features Drop in\/Drop Out-coop which allows you to play the game alone and if someone comes and visits he or she can just take over the second controller and play with you.\n\nThe camera is a mixture of following the character and being at a fixed position in a room but to reduce the amount of blind spots, you can also control it to a certain amount.","Publisher":"Playlogic Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"24343":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Harmonix","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"14d0fae1-e7a6-43a1-aa9c-9a5870c2f7ea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc8db46e-1d3a-4f10-80a2-0a45c371ebad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c115025-d331-4597-997a-f5f12d2243d3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d3148bfb-b0eb-4198-bf5e-a67c016e0c06.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cbe010f8-f9b1-4cdf-a31d-601364a476a8.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"b1346891-af6a-4124-ab16-f866ee8f12b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rock Band Unplugged","Overview":"With Rock Band Unplugged, Harmonix' music series comes to a handheld platform for the first time. Based on the same gameplay concept of hitting scrolling notes on screen in time with the music, Unplugged adapts the concept for play via buttons instead of instrument controllers while retaining most playing modes and options present in Rock Band and Rock Band 2.\n\nThe main playing mode is Tour mode, in which players create a band and tour through cities, playing setlists to gain fans, money and stars, unlocking new songs and venues in the process. Money can be spent to hire staff and outfit the band members in the in-game store. Unlocked songs can be played in Quick Play mode without the need to create a band.\n\nWhen playing a song, the player controls all four tracks: bass, drums, vocals and guitar. The four tracks are displayed side-by-side and can be moved between at will. Each consists of four note tracks, mapped to buttons on the left and right of the display. To make playing an entire song possible in this way, the concept of phrases is introduced. A phrase is a short piece on a single track. When all notes in a phrase are hit, the track continues to play on its own for a while. Completing a phrase increases the score multiplier and takes the pressure off the player since not all tracks are in need of playing at the same time. Failing phrases however can cause an instrument track to fail out and the performance to fail altogether in the end. To bring back failed instruments, the other instruments can employ Overdrive, which works the same way as in other games in the series: when a series of bright notes is hit, the Overdrive meter increases until it can be activated at the press of a button, increasing the score multiplier and bringing back bandmates. During solos, the track in question is automatically selected and the solo must be played in full, with phrases or switching not applying for its duration.\n\nAdditional playing modes are available from sub-menus: in both, phrases do not appear. In Band Survival Mode, the crowd meter will continually drop for tracks not currently played. In Warmup mode, only the currently played track is of interest and can lead to failure if not enough notes are hit. Additional options in the menu allow the unlocking of all songs, disabling solos and a never-fail mode.\n\nThe game features 41 licensed tracks (all master recordings) on-disc, most of which are re-used from the earlier games in the series. Nine tracks were all-new to the game and only became available as DLC for the console entries after a period of Unplugged exclusivity. A further 57 tracks for Unplugged were made available as DLC via PSN through an in-game store during 2009.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZzzWmuvby4o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rock_Band_Unplugged"},"24344":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Space Invaders Galaxy Beat","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TamTam Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2aa47857-7314-4c11-9281-27c87cd50b03.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"58f46d6f-7716-4545-a9cb-9ad9f6d2f347.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"440f88db-3cd4-4d5b-a481-9f328a0e831f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"24fcdcbb-c431-4a41-a039-222a155380cf.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26ff881a-f7f1-4397-b5d3-c30cf290565f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"45854b10-d086-4651-ba9b-66bfecf80a76.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Space Invaders Evolution","Overview":"Space Invaders Evolution\n\nOriginal release date(s):\nJP September 22, 2005\nEU November 3, 2006\nAUS October 27, 2006\nRelease years by system:\n2005 – PlayStation Portable\nNotes:\nThe game is known in Japan as Space Invaders: Galaxy Beat.\nIt features the original arcade version of the game, a \"match-up\" mode (similar to Midway's cocktail-only arcade game Space Invaders II, but with a different gameplay) and a new remake with new graphics, sounds and gameplay.\nIt features 3D graphics and new modes of play including multiplayer.\nElements of rhythm-action gameplay are incorporated.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"24345":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Tales Studio Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"fbc95165-d0ba-4d94-aea6-2dddcdb2dbe8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f3279138-a993-4687-9c25-a68581a3639d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92852f08-10b0-4325-8aed-6781b09c08a4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a90f71f-6346-4d3c-aef5-3d7142ec3df8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cd750184-3cf9-4337-a280-982a7a9ed3f1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave","Overview":"Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave is a spin-off of the Tales series, crossing the universes of the franchise by including heroes from previous flagship titles as playable characters. Significantly, Tales of the Heroes doesn't feature the \"Linear Motion Battle System\" present in most games of the series. Instead, gameplay mimics the style of Dynasty Warriors in which the player wanders a map full of enemies and must fight crowds of them simultaneously. Dubbed \"Aggressive Chain Capacity\" (A.CC), the battle system involves depleting A.CC points through the use of artes, and regaining these points through free movement, normal attacks, or defensive actions such as guarding. Additionally, each playable character is paired up with another from the same universe; depending on which character is chosen, the other is computer-controlled and accompanies the player to battle.\n\nThe game features five modes: Story Mode, Free Mode, Tournament, Score Attack, and Extreme Mode. Story Mode follows a set of selected characters through either a serious or comical story, including Cress Albane from Phantasia, Stahn Aileron from Destiny, Veigue Lungberg from Rebirth, Chloe Valens from Legendia, and Jude Mathis from Xillia.

Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over the world!\n\nHoly Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is.\n\nPlayers only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.","Publisher":"Nippon Ichi Software","ReleaseDate":"2010-05-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"24726":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"800c03da-a614-4fc5-bb75-43c48cb05a6c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c420403e-15b4-43b7-8be0-7e9b9ac38af6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"262bf564-b700-4cfa-af80-d1b7f35e3332.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9afac9ae-22a9-4d69-b24f-825ef578ed15.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7548f560-42dc-4c54-92e6-603ab890b489.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8d24f33e-ad97-4ad2-a59e-9f68c074a441.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"514fcf84-dadb-49e6-a0be-d655b464e75d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8d7cf308-6c0f-4e83-a4de-9fed02578ced.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"4bfe6d73-6452-4c54-b5a4-54e82cd2455c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"04546e17-6da8-48c8-bf0b-9f31dd8ed251.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Pac-Man World 3","Overview":"Pac-Man is teleported by Orson through 15 different levels to fight Erwin, his army of robots, monsters and Spectral Entities to save the world, Pac-Land and the Spectral Realm.

Bust-A-Move is the title used for the game series in North America.\n\nGameplay follows the standard formula: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the play field that shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. After a while, the existing bubbles are pushed down into the play field by a descending ceiling or by more bubbles being added from the top. The game is lost when the bubbles reach the bottom. Special bubbles include explosive ones that destroy bubbles they touch, bowling balls that knock off all bubbles in their path, star bubbles that remove all bubbles of the same color as the bubble they are touched by, and rainbow bubbles that change color into the color of a bubble group that gets popped adjacent to them.\n\nThere are four modes to choose from: Single, Endless, VS and Survival. Single is the classic single-player puzzle game, featuring 500 levels. The goal in each is to clear the pre-set pattern of bubbles. Endless is the unwinnable variant in which more bubbles are always pushed in from the top, played for high score. VS is the competitive variant played against a number of CPU opponents, where popping more than the required three bubbles sends them over to the opponent's field. Survival is a variant of the VS game: after winning a round, the own play field is not reset.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2004-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LQ9Yz8pf53c"},"24857":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cardinal Arc Portable","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Idea Factory","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"99a3d56f-81f0-463c-aeaf-9f02e724789c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5093ed69-2654-49ba-b6cd-4a6e7466b4f0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"69e4cf28-5927-410d-b55e-0aef62a0d7ca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d40e0b9d-57a0-44d5-b6a9-e193781fafdb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"796c0ddb-d2c9-4e1f-85e8-b1ddb51ab869.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"649e9c45-6393-454e-8b37-64e68490785f.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Neverland Card Battles","Overview":"Armed with the power to summon allied warriors and creatures, cast powerful spells, and build resourceful bases with his Spectral Cards, guide Galahad on his quest to stop Hellgaia and save the world.

The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.\n\nThe game's regular story mode revolves around Bomberman's hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the \"hard\" difficulty level. The player's progress is saved by a password system.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"2005-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"24915":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"United Coders","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"38d238a2-2a16-42a2-b4d2-cd6cdeefa8cc.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"734f158c-afb9-4519-a7f4-29d24d9daa98.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"246444a5-f10a-4613-a3bd-6f928fefd1fd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"447e4ee0-388d-4031-9123-5a6a63346862.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5d201f9-b829-4892-bc18-4f32086ef9e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"730805ec-4961-4dcc-8189-0deca3c59a1e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9cc05dd0-8421-4f1b-bded-4c5657c02afe.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dragon's Lair","Overview":"From deep within Mordroc's castle, a foul stench rose up to mix with the cold, damp midnight air; the telltale sign of the evil wizard's pet fire-breathing dragon, Singe; the reeking breath of the beast that guarded the Princess Daphne in the dark and deadly caves far below the surface.

Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.\n\nThere are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.\n\nRacing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold.\n\nThe PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi.\n\nThere is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia: the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8. That version is also the only PSP version released in Australia.","Publisher":"Eidos","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tyD2Zi3vSdo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ford_Street_Racing"},"25030":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"M2","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"faee6167-2d0e-4db8-bbe7-dfdd32e3cb90.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"156bfbec-da10-4374-8729-2dd7d33f34d4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"510f6a96-d9ef-4857-b205-9e06e926a91b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6c464440-1830-4f69-8d32-87cdd6d8774e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c602f49-5534-43cd-a211-e40849b9cbc3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"TwinBee Portable","Overview":"Twinbee Portable compiles five different Twinbee games on the PSP:\n\n    The arcade version of the original Twinbee\n    A version of Twinbee da! with redrawn graphics\n    The arcade version of Deta na!

Two different campaigns are available: one for Marvel heroes, one for the Imperfects. Each consists of ten fights that have to be won in order. At the start of the game, only two characters can be selected: The Thing and Johnny Ohm. Completing a campaign unlocks another character, whose campaign completion unlocks another and so forth. Fighting through the campaign also unlocks further arenas. All in all, there are seven arenas, ten Marvel characters and eight Imperfects. Compared to the console version, the roster loses Daredevil and the Human Torch, but gains Dr. Doom and Captain America.\n\nFights are best-of-three bouts and are mainly controlled via analog stick for movement and the PSP's four buttons, used for attacks, jumps, grabs\/throws and locking on to the enemy\/blocking. Characters with the appropriate superpower ability can use flight or teleportation via the left shoulder button while the right shoulder button is a context-sensitive superpower enhancer, enabling extra-powerful attacks and blocks, the details of which vary by character. Superpowers require the power meter to be charged. Both power and health recharge automatically. Landing a series of hits on the enemy increases the Rage Meter, that when full enables unlimited use of superpowers for a short while. The arenas include a lot of destructible terrain and objects for picking up and throwing.\n\nAfter a campaign fight is won, the player is first awarded a medal (gold, silver or bronze, depending on the length of the fight) and can then pick a collectible card from an assortment of five, all face down. Like in a collectible card game, these come in common, uncommon and rare varieties. It is more likely to get rarer cards with the better medals. They come in four basic categories: health, defense, power and strength. The cards can give bonuses during a fight, like increasing health or attack strength, faster recharge times, increased rage length, etc. There are also character-specific cards that can be used only with the character in question. In the game's card book, the cards can be grouped into decks, one of which can then be selected before a fight. In-game the cards are activated through the D-Pad. Only two card slots are available from the start, the other two have to be unlocked in the campaign. Combining certain sets of cards (like all character-specific cards) awards further bonuses. All in all, the game includes 173 cards (the count includes unlocked characters and arenas). Unwanted or duplicate cards can be traded in for other random cards with the recycling option, taking into account their rarity value.\n\nThe game includes a Quickplay and an ad-hoc multiplayer mode which allows the use of unlocked characters, arenas and collected cards.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"25067":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Vicarious Visions","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"44e6bd8c-945e-49cf-9d62-411c78650d24.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e1b5456d-7566-4ae2-9c38-a7c69b2f3b41.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a32e98d3-d41d-4448-9872-d4c3450f4790.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b56d54df-271f-4f5a-9ccc-27b604e0fece.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb479ab3-d311-48e3-b732-f3735b600f2d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d78671b8-e392-468a-b401-5146d6348d0a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"86a92785-6f0f-4b16-8a8e-6af6934f7dfb.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c1632ae2-a640-4e29-a8a0-50152d538357.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5c3e2a83-8e25-4dc2-8d95-6b442058edf5.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"aa7e9866-5a8d-404e-83b1-09699567551d.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spider-Man 3","Overview":"Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.\n\nThe game style is similar to Spider-Man 2 in which the player is free to explore a large scale version of New York City in a \"Sandbox\" style, this time in a larger city that allows for exploration of the subway and sewer systems. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains like Kraven, the Lizard, Scorpion, Rhino and the Kingpin, or breaking up various gang factions.\n\nOne of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When wearing the traditional red and blue costume, Spider-Man is more fast and is more accepted by the public. When wearing the black costume, Spider-Man becomes stronger and more aggressive.\n\nThe game also includes \"cineractives\" - cinematic scenes that allow for participation via button presses or controller movements.\n\nThis version also has the inclusion of Morbius and Shriek as bosses to fight against. The black costume is an interchangeable accessory after a certain point in the game, but can threaten to overwhelm Peter if worn too long.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ScljbDuRCzM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spider-Man_3_(video_game)"},"25069":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"007: Bon baiser de Russie","Region":"France"},{"Name":"007: Russia Yori Ai o Komete","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MGM Interactive","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"6d136131-ce56-4c8d-a4a7-1219f3f9a15b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"977ab5a7-01c4-4382-8282-fb9d60864930.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ae88894f-8d6c-453f-9526-c4ede003b1f7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5b995f89-ac50-4e77-9aee-0246d36c743a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e87af049-5f63-482a-937d-fa5408250b41.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"657e4f4c-1149-4c08-ac46-3b9de7fac42b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"37b26678-165a-4240-9287-6f5500cdcbf9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ddd77a73-e3b7-4aec-a3d4-0721aefe2c37.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d5e390ce-90e9-46b9-a9fe-86e2ce50eb5a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"5663cc54-4de1-4eff-aca5-dbc18169b40a.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f0e76628-611e-48ec-ae3a-d459c4c5c58d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"43c20225-c5eb-4b92-b515-2f992ac1d281.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bc4b4442-a097-498b-8226-e3984784158b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"007: From Russia with Love","Overview":"James Bond 007 : From Russia With Love will be the first game to put players in the universe of the classic James Bond films.

These levels are derived from the single-player campaign, but have been shortened and re-worked to provide a set of two-player puzzles.

Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes.\n\nBoss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.\n\nThe game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play.

The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth.\n\nIt is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.\n\nBoth characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.\n\nIn the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.\n\nMulti player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in\/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.","Publisher":"Warner Bros","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"26219":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"TT Fusion","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4176ed06-095b-4bad-a101-d0b325279867.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a2b33751-58c5-431f-8661-5da817ebed9d.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2e1b8403-a8b7-4bde-b0ea-716371e4f9d4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"16f1f9b5-352c-4825-ba07-2645e2c89a74.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2869273d-c000-4bd0-9755-8fa17567846c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a387c14-d0b7-48b4-a550-66c2d3e336ea.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"145e172b-f554-4b33-9ac2-377b42a3c903.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1d6fc174-8112-4f5f-97c6-ddefb305df38.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"453644c0-ba68-44d1-92b4-567c50735458.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars","Overview":"The handheld editions of LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars (the LEGO version of the 2008 CGI-animated TV series of the same name) play similarly to their home console cousins, while still retaining the family-friendly content in the process.\n\nThe games offer 13 levels (based around the first and second seasons of the TV series), which mostly consist of the platform puzzle-solving layout as previous LEGO video game efforts (whilst defeating a multitude of droids along the way as well as other familiar foes).

His plan involves kidnapping mutants, and, with the help of the mad geneticist Mr. Sinister, extract their powers and use them to make himself even more powerful. At first, the heroes must rescue Professor X, who has fallen into the clutches of the enemy. However, when Apocalypse kidnaps Magneto's son Quicksilver, the leader of the Brotherhood is determined more than ever to team up with his former foes and stop Apocalypse's evil plans.\n\nX-Men: Legends II - Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game and a sequel to X-Men Legends. The player controls a party of four characters, though only one at a time can be controlled directly. Beside switching the characters for combat purposes, the player is often obliged to do so, because some of the tasks in the game require the specific abilities of a certain mutant. For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.\n\nEach character has several different skills based on their mutant powers.

Looking to consolidate power, the Corporations (Crest, Mirage, and Kisaragi) have merged into one super-corporation known as \"The Alliance\". Fed up with corporate rule and oppression, and seeing a newfound threat in The Alliance, a Raven known as Jack-O (an important but minor character from Armored Core: Nexus) forms an organization of Ravens known as \"Vertex\" from the ashes of the fallen Raven's Ark. After rallying a sizable force of fellow Ravens to his cause, Jack-O declares that he will launch an all-out war on the Alliance in 24 hours. Leading the opposing force, a Raven named Evangel has rallied just as many Ravens to the Alliance and is preparing to fight Jack-O head on.

On the way to the date the young man is attacked by demonic creatures and saved by the devil summoner Kyōji Kuzunoha. Shortly thereafter, Kumiko is kidnapped by a mysterious man named Sid Davis, who hunts her boyfriend down and kills him. It appears that Kyōji was killed as well, but the student's soul is miraculously transferred into his body. Taking Kyōji's identity, the young man must now fill his place as a devil summoner, liberating the city from demons and locating Sid Davis in an attempt to rescue Kumiko.\n\nDevil Summoner continues the tradition of Megami Tensei games, being a role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling and communication with randomly encountered enemies. Unlike the main Shin Megami Tensei series, the game is set entirely in modern-day Japan. The player navigates the protagonist on an overhead city map, while individual locations are maze-like 3D dungeons explored from a first-person perspective. For the most part the player controls the main protagonist and his associate Rei, while the other four available slots of an active party can be occupied by summoned demons.\n\nBoth human characters can use either swords or guns in battles, their efficiency depending on the particular enemy's weaknesses. Weapons as well as ammunition for guns can be bought in shops. Rei and many demons can also cast a variety of offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells. First-person combat is turn-based, with player-controlled characters positioned in two rows, which affects their attack and defense values. When the hero and Rei level up the player must manually raise their parameters, further customizing their combat performance.\n\nThe player can avoid fighting randomly appearing enemies by opting to have a conversation with them. These conversations are more complex than in Shin Megami Tensei games, featuring a wider selection of dialogue choices. They may result in the demon joining the party or exchanging items, and their outcome depends on the demon's personality type and current moon phase as well. Demons consume a type of energy known as magnetite when summoned, which is gained from defeating enemies and can be exchanged for money and vice versa. Two or three demons can be fused in special locations to create more powerful ones.\n\nIn addition, the game introduces a \"loyalty\" system: newly recruited demons have various degrees of loyalty, and might even disobey the player's orders in battles if their loyalty level is too low. Loyalty can be increased through various means, depending on the personality of the demon. Most demons would gradually become loyal when repeatedly summoned and taken to fight enemies.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2005-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"29058":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Colegas en el Bosque","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0da6c947-3da2-41ac-8eea-c116eb7ca7ba.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8ce739b9-a286-463c-916b-958f1427cba5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ed2874f4-fb77-4f5e-98f8-fc44e64ffd8a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f96710bb-8e7e-4d88-a820-d557171ac210.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"717b8700-e06c-43a6-a5ef-d14817cc45a1.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44a3aa5b-c608-4262-96b3-65235a86babd.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Open Season","Overview":"Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name.

Taking into account costs to contract wrestlers, keeping a chosen wrestler happy and healthy, and putting on matches and setting up feuds to keep the ratings for the show high are the objectives of this mode.\n\nIt is also possible to earn Smackdown Dollars in the game, which the player can use to buy new moves, new create-a-wrestler items, Legends wrestlers, and even furniture to customize a locker room.

There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally, our heroes Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine make their way toward the distant dark castle, challenging - and being challenged by - everyone you come across in a game of Puyo Pop.\n\nPuyo Pop Fever is a puzzle game of the falling-block variety, the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by combining four or more of the same color, which will then vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.\n\nThe game features a two-player mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2004-12-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"29688":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Geki Sengoku Musou"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Omega Force","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"4869ce7d-6d7a-4133-b91a-dc2a7088d4b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5601fd23-1bbe-4e89-abae-bd5f0ae7d011.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"07043315-58b2-4ec7-98d9-07b893fd3baa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b2bc4445-5a3e-4741-b297-a208cda2f969.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9eb90978-2c53-44c5-b90a-ec0063b6ff5d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"afb621b7-8249-4b3f-9312-151ac2b9f6fa.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9152da1a-ae96-4b74-826f-d15d9677438e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cfba4360-3843-4033-9f8d-2e094c369f3f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b7c7f23d-808c-424e-8409-9b7af1e51f7b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3fb40e73-227f-45eb-8e62-23fde7c498aa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b5c12cac-2477-452a-9a6b-3b668f6fae35.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Samurai Warriors: State of War","Overview":"Samurai Warriors: State of War (激・戦国無双, Geki Sengoku Musou) is a portable version of Samurai Warriors, however, it is not a straight conversion.

What usually follows is the action phase, which asks the player to defeat as many opponents possible within 60 seconds. These stages can tip the battle in the player's favor.\n\nThere are four main armies for the player to participate in: the Takeda (Western), Uesugi (Eastern), Nobunaga, or the solo army. Completing the game with these four factions unlocks the final stage in the game. It guest stars characters from Dynasty Warriors 4.

The game was called by their creators a sound novel. \n\nThe idea of the game is to let the players experience five days in the lives of eight different characters. They all live somewhere in the city, each one preoccupied with his (or her) own problems. Their paths might cross without them realizing it. At any point in the game, you can switch between characters, but when you do so, the day or the time of the day of the other character corresponds to the one you are currently having. \n\nThe eight protagonists are: Keima Amemiya, a policeman; Jintaro Umabe, an actor; Masami Ushio, a gang member; Yoshiko Hosoi, without a particular profession (the only female protagonist in the game); Masashi Shinoda, a student; Ryuji Takamine, a deserter; Fumiyasu Ichikawa, a writer; and Yohei Tobisawa, a high-school boy. You control the characters by making decisions for them: where to go next, how to answer to another character, etc. In many cases, there are wrong decisions which lead to a premature end (bad ending). The story is presented through text (without voices) and still shots of live actors and locations, with occasional short animated sequences."},"30446":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pro Cycling Season 2008: Le Tour de France"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cyanide S.A.","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e4ff1ee5-1e9c-4ac2-89fd-3142a6f40414.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f782c7ed-e35f-4710-96e1-e97318c1dba8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2bc7db95-4413-499f-94d5-c2af5cf03169.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1c71cf30-2b12-4e96-8815-5a40467e5cf0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c507b9e6-3f5f-4e74-bd8c-6c4619cd0aa7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"39a4bf8c-08ae-4034-b810-00f44595b64b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pro Cycling Season 2008","Overview":"Pro Cycling: Season 2008 is the sequel to Pro Cycling: Season 2007 and part of the Cycling Manager series game group.

The game starts from a central warehouse where all unlocked cars are stored. These can be upgraded or customized in the garage.

The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals.

Returning modes include Kick-Off for friendlies, tournaments and challenges (with 31 new comeback and 30 new rout challenges) and wi-fi multiplayer (ad-hoc and infrastructure). The manager mode, already an established feature in the console versions, makes its debut on the PSP in this game. It tasks players with managing a club team, taking care of sponsors, the club board, and fan relations in addition to success on the pitch. PSP manager careers are compatible with those from the PS2 version and can be exchanged via PS2-PSP link. Exclusive to the PSP version is player training via mini-games (which are also available on their own): the returning Juggling and the new Wall Attack. In Wall Attack, the goal is to kick the ball at a wall of colored blocks for points, with a certain number necessary within a time limit to advance to the next level. Some blocks contain icons that have additional effects, like clearing neighboring blocks or blocks of the same color.\n\nAmong the new control options are chip shots and various new configurations: there is a choice between player control via analog stick or d-pad (or both, but without on-the-fly tactics changes) and optional PES-style button layout.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yU7hjv7zvRY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FIFA_07"},"30969":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Disney-Pixar Cars"},{"Name":"Bilar (Sweden)"},{"Name":"Biler (Norway)"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Locomotive Games, Rainbow Studios","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"f47b7535-0f61-43a2-8503-88d6c243dc8d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"915bf972-ea1a-43ac-8beb-94c4703ba28e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"94bcc090-325e-4b75-a35b-8b1615420aa2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"43475f52-d82c-4475-91ff-9be54ff59915.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"def7c00d-e262-4d39-90bc-a90635cb81f1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d61a763-fcae-40a8-ad79-e18ffa9007f8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c93172b9-5392-4526-832d-012899b55dfc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"89dacbab-850c-47bf-ba63-31c11f1f9528.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2debb8aa-7595-4db6-a6e3-54667c1d83d0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"086d3899-27e2-415c-ab67-d6debd2031e8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"085cda07-ce2c-4930-a959-1578abdaeeca.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"a6d158d2-2be1-4794-ad71-9e3350f9218c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cars","Overview":"Race to the finish line as you live all the fun and excitement of the Walt Disney Pictures & Pixar Animation Studios film, \"Cars.\" Play as all your favorite characters as you help Lightning McQueen capture the coveted Piston Cup Championship.

Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.","Publisher":"Crave Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31183":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eden Games","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"2b25f499-609f-4300-8e6f-aa8bbc8663fc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"75bc68f2-67eb-40ee-b49d-bf7ae8524d5e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"12d714e3-2350-41fe-ae11-9a0ff3517bb5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"09671098-0d9c-49f4-b88b-c300e2a9151e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"281dac3f-ec57-4e3d-8e01-0acd8280b258.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35ab5ea1-726f-4357-a791-0b99289c4cee.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6ec6b5b3-4df3-4d9a-aeae-bb1c1ea7d12d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8ea8aa19-5828-46cb-abc7-259e5dba9022.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"799b29ff-002a-460e-9f7d-f79aa1ad2d64.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Test Drive Unlimited","Overview":"Test Drive Unlimited is the ultimate automotive experience for car and bike enthusiasts alike.

Unlike versions for other platforms, the PSP game does not follow the plot of the film but instead presents its own story set after the film's climax, with the voice actors from the film reprising their roles for the game.\n\nShortly before Linguini and Collete can open their new bistro, their recipes are stolen by their disgruntled ex-employer Skinner. It falls to gourmet rat Remy to bring back the recipes so the new restaurant can open in time.\n\nRemy must move through five worlds of six to seven levels each, accessible from the rat colony hub world. The worlds include Linguini's apartment, the sewers, the marketplace, Paris rooftops and the restaurant. In most levels, Remy's goal is to pick up the recipe that lies somewhere in a hard-to-reach place, but other levels consist only of races or boss fights and the recipe is awarded upon winning. To get around, Remy can jump and double-jump, pull himself up ledges, crouch and run on all fours to get into tight spaces, climb up vertical and swing along horizontal poles and also swim and dive. Some enemy critters like spiders, caterpillars and bats want to hinder Remy on his quest, but he can punch them or hit them with his tail to defeat them. Some small puzzles must be solved to overcome some obstacles, usually involving finding a certain object to be used at the correct place. The ghost of chef Gusteau usually offers hints on what to do next, and Remy's fellow rats also sometimes offer helpful advice.\n\nLying about the levels are various collectibles. Apples and cupcakes restore lost health. Pieces of cheese function as currency and can be traded in with the merchant rat in the rat colony for upgrades: increasing Remy's health bar, adding more combat moves, increasing his swimming speed and more. Hidden in most levels are star keys. These can be used to unlock chests in the rat colony that contain additional recipes not found in the regular levels. Found recipes can be looked at in the game menu and contain actual cooking instructions for various dishes.\n\nThe game also includes two multiplayer modes: a race and a cheese collecting game. The race optionally allows placing chili peppers on the track, the eating of which increases speed. The cheese collecting game has several variants. In the regular variant, the player who collects the most cheese within the time limit wins. The 'weighted' variant makes a player slow down upon collecting cheese. Putting the collected cheese into a designated drop area restores regular speed. In the 'chef hat' variant, hats materialize when five pieces of cheese have been collected, with the winner being the player who collects the required number of hats or the most hats after the time limit ends.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2007-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9ubJYmhez4Q","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ratatouille_%28video_game%29"},"31186":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Strikers 1945 Plus","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arc System Works Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"920894ab-25dc-4772-a3a3-f63df12b0491.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"581e7490-3a81-41ac-ab80-7263c7496e45.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2b237328-f9fa-4315-8a1f-4b75500a37f2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f9bccbd-1ae2-4f3b-9fa8-a0c0d639a822.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Strikers 1945 Plus Portable","Overview":"Strikers 1945 Plus is a port of the classic Neo-Geo arcade game.

Player weapons are weak to begin with, but firepower is improved (and secondary missiles gained!) by capturing Power-Ups. Super bombs can also be picked up, which destroy or damage any enemy or boss that is near the explosion.\n\nThere are also special moves which are obtained by charging up a gauge on the side of the screen. The more damage inflicted upon the enemy, the faster it fills up. Once the gauge is completely full, hold down the attack button for an instant to unleash the special attack. Several special shots can be held in reserve and used when necessary.\n\nA new addition to the PSP version is an Endless Mode, which allows game replay with an enhanced difficulty immediately after the final boss is defeated.","Publisher":"PM Studios","ReleaseDate":"2009-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31187":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Reishiki Kanjou Sentouki Seikuuou","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Marionette","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"9ff7dc63-9632-4ded-8910-e9096fe28dfb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0435dcc5-b962-4d87-ac32-ee8d8d8ee337.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"102d305d-a061-4e9b-9f3c-20e05663d1e5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ab62f4c5-2251-41b7-b28b-1480b6771594.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"abb7e1c3-a479-436f-b739-764b40f48b1c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce943f4c-9476-4455-93fe-03ff2aa4013c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cfe63b35-4a86-46bf-818f-913c0c339926.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b0e91a75-8ac2-4bf8-b3b8-b6db772b474a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f527886f-027a-4be5-b3dd-8fb65daf9010.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"13b5620a-69b1-407d-9a40-12e88cb1fd37.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aces of War","Overview":"In Aces of War you take control of 40 different types of aircraft in an attempt to change the course of events.

There are several levels to complete, each becoming harder and with more androids to destroy, destroying them will make the android stronger and have the ability to upgrade its weaponry.\n\nStarting out with bare hands and eventually upgrading to weapons, but unlike other games, the guns are mounted to the android himself with the ability to have weapons coming from its hands, arms, legs and even its forehead with the ability to use multiple weapons at one time.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31213":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2a68bce1-7b4b-4c45-8d88-beade9318288.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc1ddb5b-b227-4211-9976-ac1c7de83aaf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"457622f8-45dd-4209-a51e-3aa2c1e873c8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2b3f953b-4ac7-4b91-9a70-61a0a08de183.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9b8f2b8a-9cec-4864-a50b-d7aa1e144a27.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e4e2a61d-4212-43d9-a3ef-67d8487fa9a4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35831f5c-e7da-491f-985a-8a6fa83f6eab.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26f7d51b-b647-40ba-9060-89f67ecc6147.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ffa6428f-2c1e-48df-9937-4585db3f618f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e2d0cc5c-ab6e-4fb6-9ffa-5c7f5fb2f39a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b2cf0eef-2cb1-4e2b-a50d-87eb72c2a318.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ca4399fb-08c9-4ba2-a32c-372f797c4e8a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"4d523217-9de7-4771-b5f8-77cd7eb25883.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Rengoku II: The Stairway to H.E.A.V.E.N.","Overview":"In the future, Mankind has developed special androids called A.D.A.Ms (Autonomous Dueling Armed Machine) to fight their wars for them, thus putting an end to centuries of bloodshed. Unfortunately the A.D.A.Ms were a little too effective, and have since completely eliminated the need for war altogether. Not content to just scrap the remaining androids (for some unknown reason), a tower was constructed and used to house the surviving killing machines. Trapped in this tower, the A.D.A.M androids are made to fight each other to the \"death\" much like Roman Gladiators, only without a prize if they win.\n\nThe core gameplay of Rengoku 2 is pure action. Your A.D.A.M begins with nothing but his fists to fight off the other androids in the tower. As you defeat your enemies, they sometimes drop Elixer Skins (which can be used to upgrade your health, defense and more) or weapons. Once you've gathered a few weapons you can go back to a terminal (the hub at the beginning of every floor of the tower) and equip them. Weapons can be equipped on the arms, the head or the torso, and certain weapons can be used in multiple places (i.e. the Auto Crossbow can be equipped on your head and\/or your arms but not your torso). Each section of the body is assigned a face-button (Square - Left Arm, Circle - Right Arm, X - Torso and Triangle - Head). This can lead to some nasty combos if you link your weapon attacks together. By racking up big combos as your opponent dies (this is called \"Overkill\"), you can increase the chance that they'll drop more Elixer Skins or that Flamethrower you saw them using a few seconds before you back-flipped to a safe distance and hit them with a barrage of homing missiles.\n\nThe game's pacing is also as straight-forward as its gameplay. You clear the current floor of enemies (gathering weapons and upgrading along the way), fight the floor boss, then move up to the next floor to do it again. As you progress through the tower, your enemies begin using more powerful weapons, which you can take for yourself of course, and even start to attack you in groups.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode which uses the game-sharing feature so you can actually upload a demo to your friend's PSP if they don't own the game themselves. Multiplayer is a straight deathmatch affair. Each player begins with nothing, finding weapons and support items in the environment or inside destructible crates. The pickups all look the same, so there's no way of knowing what you're about to pick up until you actually take it, which adds a bit of random, on the fly strategy to the multiplayer.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31285":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Monte Cristo","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8195abae-7cd1-4507-ae5c-d579dbbfce4a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"059ba7bb-1dd1-4475-b786-23df7cc84fef.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"40006bca-5d26-431e-9252-d22a12214a55.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"179ae42a-7265-4cc2-8d30-587242c29558.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f86688d1-bbc6-45f6-b6a6-33eb3311a501.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4fd26fdb-9855-4411-b6ae-31b15b4b44f5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"27188e42-a3bf-419a-819a-bc0032dba1dc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Silverfall","Overview":"Since the dawn of time, the inhabitants of Nelwë have relied on mighty elemental wizards to keep order.

The player controls the car on the track and tries to either complete a lap in fastest possible time, or race against either computer controlled drivers (or in multiplayer mode, against other players) and finish in top position.\n\nGame can be played in Quick Grand Prix, Event, World Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Grand Prix selects a random car and circuit to race. Event modes are Time Attack (race against ghost car), Single Grand Prix, and Scenario Mode in which the player needs to complete different kinds of racing tasks such as completing a lap with failed brakes and pitting in to fix them. Each successfully completed scenario unlocks the next one. Additional scenarios are available for download to PSP.\n\nWorld Championship mode lets the player to choose the team to race in and the championship season difficulty. All 19 circuits of the 2005 F1 season are raced in order and points for finishing in positions 1-8 are awarded. Driver with most points at the end of the season wins the championship. Before each race the player can drive practice laps to get familiar with the track and the car setup. Player can also drive a single lap qualifying run which will determine the grid position at the race start.\n\nThe difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) define the total number of laps, weather conditions, pit stops, and tyre wear. Initially only the easy level is selectable and must be completed successfully in top three in order to unlock the medium level. In same manner, the medium level must be completed in top three to unlock the hard level. Also the Single Grand Prix Event is unlocked by successfully completing the easy level.\n\nIn Multiplayer mode, up to 8 players can play in three different race types. As in singleplayer Time Attack, each car races against top time ghost car. Both Head to Head and Single Grand Prix modes allow players to race a single grand prix, the difference being that in the latter mode, computer controlled AI drivers are entered to fill the grid if less than eight players enter.\n\nF1 Grand Prix also includes a TV Mode Race where AI cars race each other and the player has no control, except selecting the camera view.\n\nAll 2005 season cars are initially available but the game has unlockable F1 cars from past years, such as Lotus-Climax 25, turbo powered Williams FW11, and Cosworth classics Lotus-Ford 79 and Williams FW08. Overall game style is more arcade than simulation, eg. collisions do not cause any noticeable damage, after a spin-out the car is automatically pointed to the right direction, and driving off-track slows the car down. A simple car setup system has three presets: Defensive, Balanced, and Aggressive. Player can also enable Brake Assist which automatically applies brakes in corners if the speed is too high.","Publisher":"SCEE","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31320":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Sudoku","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Professor Sudoku","Region":"Europe"},{"Name":"Sudoku Coach","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atomic Planet Entertainment Limited","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b174bec0-2ca2-452a-ba79-f30b9d0e9ba3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"71df2f73-ed17-4dad-8a6e-f2547b5f2616.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"32b33d9e-201e-41e0-9e28-8c4f8109e8d2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18ab01da-aff1-4af4-88e3-29aa0a0833c4.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Carol Vorderman's Sudoku","Overview":"Let the ultimate Sudoku expert, Carol Vorderman, show you how to play and conquer the number game phenomenon sweeping the world.

As described by its catchphrase, the game tells \"The tale of nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history.\"\n\nThe game was the first in the series to not officially be translated into English by Sega.

Its royal family began practicing dark magic, guided by evil forces lurking beneath the surface of the country. A remote descendant of the cursed bloodline, Zoela Reinhardt, married the captain of the king's guards, Houser Forester. This valiant man went off to fight horrifying creatures that appeared within the Royal Cemetery. He has not returned, and neither did anyone who accompanied him. His son, John Alfred, ventured into the depths of the cemetery, determined to find out what has happened and whether there was still a chance to rescue his father.\n\nThe original King's Field is the first of the first-person fantasy RPG King's Field series and is notable for being one of the first fully polygonal 3D games. It was released in Japan weeks after the launch of the PlayStation, and never localized or released elsewhere. When King's Field II was later released in the West, it was renamed King's Field for those regions. The journey takes John Alfred Forester through a five-level dungeon populated by a few friendly NPCs and deadly traps and monsters. The entire world, including objects, enemies, and the player's own equipment, is rendered with 3D textured polygons.\n\nThe player collects gold and items from slain enemies, and can purchase weapons and spells at two shops located within the dungeon. Weapons and magic are assigned to different buttons so the player can easily attack with both, however, recharging action bars for each prevent rapidly spamming attacks. Skills and stats increase with use, and items can be bought or collected that raise specific stats when used (green Verdite stones raise magic, for example). The final boss can only be defeated with magic, encouraging players to grind a well-rounded character to a maximum level.\n\nEach level of the dungeon holds enemies more difficult than the last, as well as greater rewards. The game takes place entirely within the narrow walls of the dungeon, with the only \"safe\" areas on the first floor. Players can save their progress to the memory card by activating crosses mounted on walls throughout the levels.","Publisher":"FromSoftware, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"31572":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FromSoftware, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"6baee3ff-8968-471a-9baa-18d3bb38782b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"49fb0af1-c704-4e1a-a223-22ad1eeea885.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Field: Additional II","Overview":"A storm runs through the kingdom of Verdite, taking away the precious Moonlight Sword and spreading evil throughout the land.

The basic gameplay is still the game, as the frog moves one (invisible) square per key press, which maintains the feel of the original arcade game instead of the modern, smoother movement mechanics.\n\nWhen Frogger climbs a tree to get some moonfruit for Toady, his friend is gone when he returns. He follows his footprints and finds out Toady is under the control of Dr. Wani, who has ordered his mini-crocs to place mind-control helmets on all residents of the land. It is up to Frogger to undo this.\n\nThe game consists of different small levels with puzzle elements. Frogger can be moved around with one square per movement, or two for a regular jump. This mechanic is most often used to navigate maze-like platforms with water. Ironically, Frogger drowns when touching liquid. While moving around he can collect coins and there are checkpoints to save progress. He can use his tongue to push or pull objects, or swing from branches. There is also a vertical jump to reach objects mid-air and he can turn 90 degrees to face a different direction. The frog has a limited amount of lives, but one can be restored by picking up an apple.\n\nThe story is continued through drawn cut-scene sequences with static images and voice-overs (on the PSP, there is only written text for the DS version). The PSP version supports game sharing, while the DS top screen shows the game statistics while playing the story mode. There are also seven mini-games, including the original arcade Frogger but with polished graphics, and hats and costumes to unlock with the collected coins.","Publisher":"Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2005-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"32356":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Der Pate","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Redwood Shores","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"65b087ae-d315-40f5-97a7-9a4185f2a963.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e5696f6-d2a4-499e-bfae-7cc11b08ae2e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d53d8556-9110-4599-a146-88392cbb7608.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fea9e191-e70a-4898-90a4-c79d22af8de5.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"8370dd4a-33f5-48ad-9f54-ae0d462dacf1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Godfather Mob Wars","Overview":"Based on the 1972 film of the same name, The Godfather immerses you in the dangerous world of the Mafia.

Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.\n\nThe game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.\n\nThough the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.\n\nFor multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a \"Remote Weapon System\", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34452":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Heroes de la Republica","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Krome","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"3cde2ab1-3dd1-4db5-a0c4-93191969ee4b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7ce46121-3115-4285-9bcd-b6b7a11b67aa.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9b351ee5-5918-4408-9b8f-1accc6949ddb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c75162fb-1375-4018-9d1b-19aa80b4cd48.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a4f26fc1-9bd4-4d4b-a191-2d84ce984396.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bdd66040-ce78-4b10-9eab-6c1c588fe0ba.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9738492-ffa9-454f-bc69-181963df22cb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e3d9859-d822-43f9-8225-39138d883690.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d1646221-3c29-4a62-a48c-a192020d7976.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"db8aadcd-e589-43eb-b020-32a83caee4b3.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cf6fad8b-9b1c-45f0-b7cc-205cd5adaa44.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cbbb33dc-0520-46d2-9cd4-dabb83ecf9f4.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"ea1c4b84-5389-4d66-940d-3d27bc716175.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dfa82e13-537c-4125-b64d-96592edb5c96.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b04e2d39-4da6-4015-9bb8-43f779d4fa9d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes","Overview":"Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes bridges the gap between season one and two of the animated TV series. In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay style very similar to Lego Star Wars.\n\nThe game is fully built around drop in\/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Ahsoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.\n\nTo buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34453":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Gamble Con Fight","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Think & Feel Inc.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0382236b-f5b6-471d-a07f-b642c5d45e0e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4061e404-0c8a-4ddd-bec3-ef271f8002b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0f2b3f59-d442-46e2-8ad2-5d59963b522b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1ef06a11-17c0-4acc-9b6f-a6f2f8faa37a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"31f80484-e3f2-4535-806a-2ee0ef809151.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"730db448-6f3e-4515-90e9-069a4898cfb5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"544bea9a-bc76-4004-b183-f88990327323.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"311613f4-7474-411f-98a7-753e8df5824f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74a2418a-feef-4f7c-a313-f6e90e2d33b3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1dce46e4-dc39-454f-a524-d62646677706.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2d92b689-2e70-4d58-b7f5-fbac2fbe4288.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Con","Overview":"The Con is a fighting game featuring 20 different characters as well as the ability to create-a-fighter with the ability to use face-mapping from the players photo collection.

This version does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.\n\nThe game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies, or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs to be completed to win the event.\n\nThe game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed, only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts, bus stops, trash cans and other objects.\n\nThe game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down & Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34455":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Electronic Arts Canada","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ad5aa24a-0be5-446a-a5b7-a77535cb9aea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a27d290c-49b8-4725-ac1c-714a67d1b73c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"31677229-d62c-4744-8dd5-d6f4893404bb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8574448b-34c1-4fc4-ad31-494309543b19.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"773f9633-2589-4ce7-a023-72838c38cc46.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fbd83866-c794-4ddb-87c1-5b5b382de7b0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"67b74c22-98a3-4fe1-9d07-7b75ef4e82ac.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bcee329e-0839-448f-aea1-6850468bd0d7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"72b4d5bc-7853-4099-b756-20db12bad555.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Tiger Woods PGA Tour","Overview":"Take on Tiger Woods and other golfing greats from past & present in Tiger Woods PGA Tour on the Playstation Portable handheld video game system.

Those familiar with the movie will recall the \"Brand New Reality\" montage sequence where Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Agent P and Dr. Doofenshmirtz are jumping into one bizarre dimension after another while being pursued by evil Normbots. The video game's storyline fills in some gaps as to what exactly took place during this frantic dimension-hopping. The various dimensions our heroes pass through contain a number of references to certain episodes of the TV show that were not referenced in the movie. Two players can co-op play at the same time, or a single player can work with a computer-controlled partner.\n\nThe game plays like a typical platformer with numerous puzzles, mini-games and boss battles in-between exploring and fighting basic enemies. There are countless items to collect and special characters (each with their own unique ability) to unlock as well as costumes\/skins that can be obtained for all of the playable characters. Once more than the two main characters are unlocked, players can switch characters between levels if they so choose. Weapons can be customized with different colors and sound effects once these are earned\/unlocked. Additionally, there are many achievements\/trophies to be won and an increased difficulty mode becomes available after achieving the final trophy. Background props change depending on what time of the year the game is played (e.g. jack-o-lanterns are visible around Halloween, snowmen and Christmas lights appear in December, etc).\n\nThis game should not be confused with the DS game that has the same title, but is otherwise a completely different game with an alternate plot line, other types of weapons, dimension levels and boss battles unrelated to the Wii and PS3 versions.","Publisher":"Disney Interactive Studios, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"34779":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nippon Ichi Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"12c2ecd2-86c6-44a0-a6be-e85f199265a7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"49277932-67ac-44d2-8d68-4c057a21496c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f852505a-a0a6-4fac-9fc7-8f2bfd9beb68.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6bde1fe3-eca6-40f6-9bd9-4a855b70d9dc.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"be24ca57-a224-4ed7-bd33-0ff75f4e898a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"47ea4c50-2dc8-4068-9148-c7de4e1bce3f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"61a79bb6-b56f-4593-9ad3-f4c6bd9495cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"01c7c641-6854-4a41-b65e-87185f6eed7f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"La Pucelle: Ragnarok","Overview":"La Pucelle: Ragnarok is a Tactical RPG game published by Nippon Ichi, released in Japan only on November 26, 2009 for the Sony PlayStation Portable.

In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage.\n\nThe game's new \"WWE Universe\" mode replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match.\n\nRoad to WrestleMania mode has been modified to include new features such as backstage roaming, mini-quests, and further interaction with other Superstars.

Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.\n\nThere are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility.

In the main story mode the player needs to rescue an old friend who has gone missing. Before that, several short missions in different environments need to be played, ranging from forest to open fields and snowy landscapes. Players are usually accompanied by an AI character with short cut-scenes that advance the story. Most missions require the player to explore the terrain, getting past obstacles (e.g. swimming through a river when a bridge breaks down) and shooting every animal that comes in sight.\n\nShown from a first-person perspective, players can move and look around freely, strafe, aim, zoom and slow down time for a moment to get a better shot. Targets are highlighted in red when the cursor passes over them. The arsenal includes everything from small handguns to heavy rifles. They have limited ammo and need to be reloaded regularly. On the terrain additional ammunition and medikits can be found. When animals attack or get too close, there is a secondary attack where the player uses his weapon to push animals away. The species include rabbits, lions, wolves, bears and more.\n\nNext to the main Story mode, Quick Action offers short games in different settings. From a fixed position, players need to take out animals or practice targets with a limited amount of time. In one of these even dinosaurs get hunted from inside a helicopter.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2006-04-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=G6ZhuDL_d0o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cabela%27s_Dangerous_Hunts:_Ultimate_Challenge"},"95757":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"B.B.Studio","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"4fe482e1-0fb6-4fb7-b365-84c628703ff7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3855ccc3-92a5-4d29-941d-5b0511c725ee.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cbe84037-9928-43e4-b9b3-c041a7b0557d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dai-2-Ji Super Robot Taisen Z Saisei-hen","Overview":"Super Robot Wars Z2: Saise-hen, yet another game in Namco Bandai's Super Robot Wars series, is the immediate sequel to Super Robot Wars Z2: Hakai-hen.\n\nDespite its billing as a two-part game, Saise-hen is entirely independent of Hakai-hen.

To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially Byakuya Kuchiki and Toshiro Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other characters.

But the plot thickens as Ringo uncovers plot after diabolical plot and realizes the very existence of mankind is at stake.\n\nPuyo Puyo 7 is different from other Puyo Puyo games in that the story mode is told in 6 acts of varying numbers of episodes, as Ringo Andou (and the friends she meets along the way) travel to place after place, battling popper after Puyo popper to stop a mysterious force from flooding the world with Puyo. There are 19 players in all, with 5 being new (including Ringo). The gameplay, however, is quite similar to Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary - swamp your opponents in a flood of Nuisance Puyo across 5 (less compared to 15th Anniversary) different game play modes and move on to the next area. \n\nAs usual, there is also the battle mode, where up to 4 players (8 on the DS version) compete to see who is the best Puyo popper. As in 15th Anniversary, only the Original Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Fever rules are available in 8-player games.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puyo_Puyo_7"},"105891":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Blokus Club Portable with Bumpy Trot","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Irem Software Engineering","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"7266ee70-d767-4ac2-b636-00ca50a123b7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"882dd86f-c13e-4eee-92a3-2b59ad4193cb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fbfed22e-7af8-455a-b990-71e312bcdc21.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"87af5bd3-5507-4f03-a091-3956da4f907c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ff7c1f0e-17ae-4dbe-ad85-b935f000d885.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4370cabe-c057-4e32-95b6-dd7b27ba5493.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fa1f232e-e1e6-424c-9abc-fb602ec14c5e.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Blokus Portable: Steambot Championship","Overview":"The most celebrated game of the century is coming to your PSP!

It was originally published in 2000 by Atlus in Japan and North America for the PlayStation. The game was later remade by Atlus for the PlayStation Portable. This version, released in Japan in 2012, did not receive an overseas release. In response to this, the PlayStation version was released on PlayStation Network in 2013.\n\nEternal Punishment takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Sumaru, and is a direct sequel to Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Taking place a few months after Innocent Sin, the game follows reporter Maya Amamo as she investigates the Joker Curse, a malign phenomenon where people's wishes and rumors are coming true and causing chaos. During her investigations, she and others who join her gain the ability to summon Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor.\n\nHalfway through the production of Innocent Sin, writer Tadashi Satomi felt that a fresh point of view was needed in addition to Tatsuya, laying the groundwork for Eternal Punishment. The original producer (Kouji Okada), character designer (Kazuma Kaneko) and composers (Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya and Masaki Kurokawa) returned alongside Satomi. The second game began development after Innocent Sin was completed, and while it reused most of the assets from Innocent Sin, the gameplay and Rumor system were improved upon. The game's theme song, \"Change Your Way\", was written by English singer-songwriter Elisha La'Verne based on the game's premise. Reception of the game in Japan and the west has generally been positive, with reviewers appreciating improvements over Innocent Sin, the plot, the gameplay systems, and the improved localization compared to the original Persona.","Publisher":"Atlus","ReleaseDate":"2012-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yaSK6ssbZDg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Persona_2:_Eternal_Punishment"},"122592":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Williams Pinball Classics","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FarSight Studios","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"dc2ee6cf-ffd1-4799-b1ed-79b26e54a005.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fe0d0502-df7e-4465-8f64-a97f1f55a85e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b8626419-be7e-4400-a551-eaf064310feb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3e1c3969-a2a0-43f7-8e1d-88495b7cc1ae.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97e34e98-82a8-4a73-b861-9949c0e1717c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1b99f306-26c0-404f-9adc-ac875e5162f6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"76277cdd-f395-4e4a-9ba9-9821a59f7b0b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c46ade99-1427-4085-980b-05bd309e7b51.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"1218b0aa-b438-4d12-827c-6da1a12ac558.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4e164acf-c2f0-4a0b-9c54-e98fb515af47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection","Overview":"Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection is another entry in the PHOF budget series.

The player can choose between three game modes: Flight, Trial and Replay.\n\nSince the game is endorsed by Japan Airlines, a real world airline, it is not actually possible to \"crash\" an airplane.

As groups of cubes begin an ominous lurching roll in your direction, you must capture each cube (with the exception of the black ones) or be crushed.\n\nYou capture a single cube by lighting a square at your feet, allowing a cube to roll over it, and then activating that lit square. The activated square removes the cube from play. With a bit of planning, you can use special cubes to set off sequences of lit squares that can then capture many cubes at once.\n\nIf any cube rolls off the end of the platform, however, or you capture a black cube, the platform on which you're standing gets a little shorter. Should you get pushed off the end of the platform, you will fall into the black abyss, and to your doom. When your game ends you are assigned a high score, appropriately called an IQ.\n\nThis entry in the Intelligent Qube series is essentially a compilation, including over 7000 levels selected from the three earlier games in the series (Intelligent Qube, IQ Final and I.Q. Remix), including 100 Attack modes and a new Survival mode. Next to regular ad-hoc multiplayer, Sony also introduced a new form of game sharing. I.Q. Mania was released at the same time as the puzzlers XI Coliseum and Bakufuu Sentai Bombermen. If you own one of these games and a friend has one as well, you can play multiplayer games for any of them simply by connecting. Each game also includes a demo for the other two games and five multiplayer minigames: Bowling, Kunoichi Densetsu, Double Smash , N.U.M. and Party x Party x Party.","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"123279":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f9cfd656-6795-4ae4-9c87-eb033c3e516c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1b640282-64be-4030-9557-c5a32e261d5e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7f9ba5e-948a-4c68-920f-5ae474f0ac4d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Heroes Phantasia","Overview":"Heroes Phantasia is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Bandai Namco Games, which was released in Japan in 2012.","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2012-01-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"123281":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FarSight Technologies, Inc.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"10929f3f-24bf-44b5-9b78-07bbda81ef9a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c798fa1f-458e-44f0-bd54-3210432ddda4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fa802c46-1bc3-4394-a648-4d819fda4ca2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f48bbed-ced3-4cc3-a63f-31cb1a56329b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f0887eac-6fb3-4794-a554-8745ebbb4ad7.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hard Rock Casino","Overview":"Hard Rock Casino is a gambling simulation game which includes over 20 different gambling games including Slots, 5 various forms of Poker, Blackjack, Baccarat, Craps, Roulette and Pai Gow as well as horse race and sports betting.

AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with, yes, you guessed it, 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. As the title implies, the game takes place in the island of Guam, and idols will wear bikinis a lot, and regular clothes lot less.\n\nThe game mostly plays like a visual novel which user real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The setting itself is not the only thing differing from the first game. This game features new poses and photo shots with different clothes (the more showing kind) and re-recorded voice-acting by AKB48 members for the new scenario. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date. During the date part which plays as a visual novel, there will be a dialogue selection which will show the girl you're with if you're rude, indifferent or like her. This in turn may prompt her to contact you again at the beginning of the next day. Some correspondence occurs irregularly when the girl liked how she felt when she was with you on previous dates. Likewise, addresses of the girls you were rude with will disappear from the list until only one remains. Initially, all 48 girls are listed as your potential girlfriends. During special so called escort event scenes, idols will wear a special bikini and pose jut for you. Any event scene during visual novel gameplay lets on-screen text be toggled off and allows for certain amount of zooming.\n\nVarious unlockables such as visual cards, event scenes, and steel photos can accessed from the menu, while collected cards can be traded with other players.

Though primarily an action game, Way of the Samurai is as much about negotiation and politics, as it is about sword duels.\n\nThough more or less a direct port of the PS2 original, some changes have been made to the control scheme, to facilitate the move to a new platform, while a moderate reduction in graphic fidelity is noticeable when the two versions are compared.

The player character this time is Hajime Hinata, a new student at the elite Hope's Peak Academy. On his first day at the Academy, his class meets Usami, a pink rabbit who dresses like a magical girl and introduces herself as the students' teacher. She transports the kids to Jabberwock Island, an uninhabited tropical paradise, tells them that they are now on a class trip, and instructs them to befriend one another and collect hope fragments. But just as the students are getting used to their bizarre new situation, the sadistic Monokuma appears and throws them into a game of life and death.\n\nOnce again, the Hope's Peak students can only escape the island if one of them is able to murder a classmate without being caught. Once a murder takes place, a class trial will be held to decide the guilty party. If the murderer is not correctly decided upon, that student will be able to leave at the cost of everyone else's lives. However, if the students do find the culprit, that single person will be messily executed in an elaborate display.\n\nThe game is divided into six chapters, which are further broken into Daily Life and Deadly Life segments. In Daily Life, the player can engage in Free Time conversations, in which Hajime gets to know his classmates by selecting the correct options in their dialogue trees. Completing Free Time awards Skill Points that can be spent for various beneficial abilities during trials. This part of the game also includes exploration of Jabberwock Island and scripted scenes. Once a murder has been committed, Deadly Life begins, and Hajime must scour the island for evidence during the Investigation. When all evidence has been collected, the game switches to the Class Trial, a fully-voiced set of cutscenes and action-oriented minigames. The player must then use both their reflexes and logic to present the correct evidence, debate with other students, and draw the conclusions that will expose the true murderer.\n\nAn alternate mode called Island Mode is unlocked after beating the main game. It presents an alternate universe in which Monokuma does not sabotage the class trip, and the students collect the hope fragments as per the original plan. Free Time conversations may also occur in this game mode, as well as brand-new scenes for each character.","Publisher":"Spike Chunsoft","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Danganronpa_2:_Goodbye_Despair"},"130312":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Super Robot Wars A Portable"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Banpresto","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"680c31e5-fc77-49b8-9b41-1bde6e6037c7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"37196521-076d-48c9-b7c0-16e70703d82b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e588eea3-11ef-43c2-b79f-ff6ba0a6ca9e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07d24828-f800-488a-9799-152ba3706bd8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0eae0c1e-9e9a-40af-a3d4-be7f6b300a9b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dc0c687a-122b-4242-b27c-8bd7183b79fa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0e246e22-5375-4248-a05e-2a2b23dce4f4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Robot Taisen A Portable","Overview":"The story revolves around an organization called the Shadow-Mirror, which exists in a parallel world where events happened in a different way than the original game world, thus making the state of the worlds different, though a bit similar at times.

They don't realize that at this moment they unleashed a powerful demon into the world, and that this demon has already possessed the soul of one of the boys...\n\nThe Apocalypse IV is the first Tengai Makyō game that is set outside of the Japan-like country Jipang. Much like Jipang of earlier games, United States of the late 19th century is not in a historically correct environment in this game, but an alternate world populated by demons, Biblical figures, and deliberate clichés (cardboard Native Americans, pop culture references, etc). \n\nThe gameplay largely follows the general Japanese RPG template and Tengai Makyō gameplay style in particular. As in the previous games, magic spells have to be sought out and acquired rather than learned or bought. A notable change is the absence of random enemies - all the enemies are visibly wandering on the world map or in the dungeons. Other gameplay additions include special attacks that can also performed by several members of the party as a combo, and obtaining money by selling trophies received in battles.","Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tengai_Maky%C5%8D:_Daiyon_no_Mokushiroku"},"132074":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tenky","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e9135f60-e938-46c2-87c1-0dfe5127b7b0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0eb0023a-d8fc-4248-ad77-b1551b891fa9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6f296a9-30db-49cf-af6b-438b33e56232.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Twelve: Sengoku Fuushinden","Overview":"Twelve: Sengoku Fengshenden is a Strategy game, developed by Tenky and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2005.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2005-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"132108":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"THEXDER NEO"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gust","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a8746a98-f10b-4132-857d-5c3a821b4841.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ec6ea7d6-ed18-4f06-a210-24b7a73a0a3a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"297fa480-6ec2-4099-b1b6-28d5593ed5bb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e1766129-9174-4156-a3d1-502039a35085.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49069c2f-ec52-4d30-8daf-5410ee011c09.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b61c7be6-541a-48c3-8c30-044ebd6d4c93.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"44ef40e3-6749-45c8-bc5b-602ecb866448.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2bfd1e51-13d6-4bee-bd80-582cee6507ed.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"fb246c48-1dec-4795-af48-7163ac159234.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"19df0f89-584b-42a7-a494-739670e1c6f8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Thexder Neo","Overview":"During a routine survey, the interstellar weapons platform Laevina detects Nedium, an asteroid of unknown origin, and soon finds itself in the grip of the planetoid's ultramagnetic field.

The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.\n\nRaces are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.\n\nNext to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.","Publisher":"Konami Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5r_Q8kmW1ts"},"133940":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zeroscale","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"93fa73df-b8b6-4658-bcc2-fbcc15f2b90a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ce6929b6-2477-42f9-a4e6-71adf5272ccd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18e4260a-82f6-47ed-a0c2-20a4cc65a936.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"03a85e17-a74f-432d-8d48-1d8eae844428.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7e930f52-c0d9-4029-9a38-e8d0165139c8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d390ccb0-afc2-4d47-86d8-5985515eb224.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Skate Park City","Overview":"Skate Park City draws on the very best elements of the great Tony Hawk and Jet Set Radio series fused with its own unique ingredients to make it the coolest, most creative and downright fun skateboarding game seen on any platform.

Before tackling a new campaign mission, which have different difficulty levels assigned to them, the used car can be changed.

The game starts by asking some personals details. You enter your name, date of birth, and your favourite music style. You then choose one of the three available female characters that will guide you through the game. The player then gets to access the Cover Girl magazine where the content is customized based on a number of questions. The game for instance asks you whether numbers or letters attempt you more, if you are in the mood for food choices or to release your inner child, and if you are more interested in being dressed to kill than deadweight dumping. The game then generates a Cover Girl magazine based on your preferences.\n\nAs a digital magazine the player can then read articles about the behaviour of men, horoscopes, recipes, do a tarot session, answer questions in a sex-o-meter quiz, consult the Manlation to get to know the behaviour of men, complete a Purse-onality quiz to find the perfect purse or do Sudoku puzzles.

Released only six months after the previous PSP game, this version comes with updated rosters and several features taken from the PS2 version, but has its own selection of modes.\n\nReturning modes include single games and a full season. The new chemistry feature makes its way over from the PS2, influencing players' stats depending on how well they interact with each other. Also seen on the PS2 is the \"Wayne vs Wayne\" mode, in which the two competing teams build up their \"99 meter\". When full, The Great One himself joins the team as an extra player for a short time. In addition to single games, this mode can also be played in the PSP-exclusive NHL Showdown mode, which is a ladder against all NHL teams, with the finale against a team of five Gretzkys. Another exclusive mode is called \"3 on 3 Countdown\".

Players need to unlock the different games by competing in a Tour with three difficulty levels. On Easy, for each 50,000 points another game is opened up and clips from the series are unlocked. The included games are set at different, fictitious locations in Britain and require a lot of button mashing:\nDarkley Noone: Vicky Pollars needs to complete two laps on roller-skates in a skate park. She has to collect CDs to throw a party, while avoiding hazard, performing tricks when jumping in the air, and grinding on rails.\n\nHerby: Lou and Andy go to the swimming pool, but as soon as they are there, Andy doesn't like it. While Lou explains to a guard how he wants his handicapped friend get to swim, Andy need to dive off diving boards and perform tricks.

She needs to progress over the pitch step by step and avoid hitting the defenders as that returns her to the starting location. She does get points for shooting them in their private parts. The PSP version is slightly different as it is presented as a game of penalty kicks, without defenders. The direction and the force of the kick can be determined separately.\n\nPox: make matches of three identical items collecting food in Maggie's gullet as she gulps it down.

It takes place after the happenings of the first game. The evil space witch Aguira is still alive after having escaped her death sentence. It's once again up to the executioner Drake to find her and bring her to justice. Aguira has used the xyanide to create a strange world that Drake has to travel through and battle countless of enemies.\n\nXyanide Resurrection is a third person shoot 'em up, similar to a rail shooter. The player controls a spaceship travelling through space. Forward motion is automatic but the player can move the ship up and down and left and right to avoid the fire of the incoming enemies. The player can also rotate the view as the enemies attack from all angles. As enemies are destroyed they drop pieces of xyanide that the player can collect. Xyanide restores health but it can also be used to purchase upgrades and new weapons in the store between levels. When starting out the ship is equipped with a simple fusion gun that shoots single shots and bombs when bigger explosions are needed. Three extra weapons can be bought: shotgun, laser and rockets. It is also possible to buy a magnet to easier collect xyanide and a shield that can take some damage.\n\nThe game's story mode consists of five levels that have to be completed sequentially.

The gameplay and available modes are fairly identical to the previous game (including the team racing controls), but the pace has been kicked up a notch, with an added blur effect to enhance the sense of speed. A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations.\n\nThe main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways.\n\nThis is the first NASCAR game to appear on the PSP. It is fairly similar to the console versions, but does not include Total Team Control to talk with the team. The handheld version includes a new feature: Instant Rewind. While racing, a meter builds up with time, which can be used to rewind the game action when crashing or taking a bad turn. A few of the game modes are different.\n\nSterrance is featured on the US cover, as the driver for the #12 Alltel Dodge. The PAL release has Thomas's DeWalt Ford Fusion.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2006-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"134465":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FarSight Studios","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c4209bb9-684f-4955-8cb5-a35cf7162bf9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d040ceff-39c0-4312-be02-90144ea390ee.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6fc26313-3f9f-46d6-94d3-e5c098d56e31.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"33d2fb77-cd87-4fbd-b5ee-fd4c455741bd.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e8a74074-1c41-4b7a-b691-45fc5fc739f3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f1ac7e1-cee1-4c5b-8729-6d6dc68c18d5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d26c96a8-4d43-4d81-bbd0-827c4efcc301.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"453b63ca-92fc-4bcc-b19f-2bc3c7d79948.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"79941304-a018-451d-a4cf-0d9e9e263796.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fdcecc7c-c5b9-4ac1-b892-2c9473301dc9.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c390f98e-80ce-4c79-a951-8f810bb3877c.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"b514d867-e153-4b33-935e-c776a59453f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f88159d5-f054-4e06-b24c-ab4c6ee9ca47.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Scarface: Money. Power. Respect.","Overview":"Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. is a turn-based strategy game based on the 1983 movie Scarface. Players need to manage their drugs business and expand their turf to rule and expand the drug trade in Miami, just like the movie. The game can be played in a single-player mode, either as scenarios from the movie or as a cartel challenge managing one of several unlockable cartels. Each scenario has different objectives such as gathering wealth, building a certain amount of structures or taking over rivals. Usually there is a main goal with several, optional secondary goals. The movie scenarios are interspersed with clips from the movie.\n\nMost of the game is played on a single, fixed-screen where a map of the environment is shown, divided into different turfs with colours signalling whom it belongs to. Players interact through different menu structures as each round goes to three phases. The buy phase is used to hire thugs to fight or pushers to distribute, while constructing buildings such as labs and warehouses. Next is the power moves. These are advantages that can be bought in the areas of combat, drugs and law to influence the odds and apply pressure. The final planning phase is the dealing phase where the drugs is sold, based on the pushers and the structures of the first phase. This is done by going through the available turfs and determining where and what to sell (cocaine, heroin, pot) and which amount.\n\nThere is also a combat phase to the game as a final step as players decide to either invade a neighboring cartel or defend. Unlike the rest of the game the execution of the combat phase is shown in a full 3D environment showing the fighting thugs as the camera swings around automatically to show the action. The combat is turn-based and player interaction is limited to attacking, defending or using power moves. Power moves can turn around a disadvantageous position for instance by providing grenade launchers or hiring snipers. Other option are setting car bombs, killing reinforcements or preventing the enemy from calling in reinforcements. In the planning phase it also possible to offer an alliance to a rival player.\n\nThe multiplayer gameplay is similar, but played between friends each representing a different cartel. Each cartel is different based on three statistics. Like in the single-player cartel challenges it starts with players taking turns selecting the different turfs on the map at the start of the game.","Publisher":"Sierra Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scarface:_Money._Power._Respect."},"134466":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Everybody's Golf 2","Region":"Europe"},{"Name":"Minna no Golf Portable 2","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Clap Hanz","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"4873f69f-7a02-410d-a48d-6e1345c04c42.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"107d6d55-eec9-448e-8d56-752b8d16d411.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a5b83bd2-99a8-4d57-a249-a1c47de643f0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ada00efd-aea2-4122-908f-00a344336a94.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"81e1ac7d-f0f1-40eb-b62b-979d69baf8b5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eb3a9131-c6d1-4b73-aae2-4603892dc8c5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15ffdfa7-9d42-469c-9720-886b965f0443.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6c7a6a2c-cbdb-4b1e-908d-aa1011175d6d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"39783a4c-b61a-4f4d-b0bb-b6043c21d3df.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"447d9d2f-d429-4b4e-912c-2d648ce0d006.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8c6e7c00-7f15-4022-9177-390c4e26277d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee 2","Overview":"Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee 2 is the sequel to Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee with 12 new courses to play on ranging from a tropical island, a desert and even an oceanfront view.

It features four different classes of car (Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle), with the PSP version having Jet Powered as a bonus in Quick Race mode. There are 5 modes: Tutorial, Quick Race, Single Event, Career, and Vs.\n\nThe tutorial is a series of videos that walk the player through the steps needed to properly race without getting disqualified. Quick race lets the player select a vehicle, driver, and weather, then simply race. (Unique to the PSP version is the ability to race different classes against each other, with the less powerful car getting a head start.) Single event mode strings together multiple races. It includes 4 qualifying rounds, then the top 16 racers will move on to an elimination tournament. Career follows a driver through multiple events, tracking money from wins and spent on repairs. Vs is a quick race between two human players. On the PSP, this is done through ad-hoc wireless; on the PS2, split-screen.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels: rookie, veteran, and pro. Higher difficulties have tougher opponents, and require more precise aiming. In addition, rookie difficulty allows for auto-align on the track, and auto-tuning during the pre-race tune-up. No matter what game mode is being played, the pre-race tuning is incredibly important. There is only a limited amount of time (5 minutes in rookie difficulty, 3 otherwise) to pick the best settings, and everything from tire pressure to weight distribution is included. Finally, additional drivers can be unlocked by winning championships in career mode.","Publisher":"THQ Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"140959":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team Fusion","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3fc9b08b-ec87-4d0f-a494-b5d60bdf766f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"206b1b4f-b675-46c2-ada6-fc1e1b25a04c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3f3fd73-44a7-413f-b4db-81b5cbe13303.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6cac22c6-296a-4d2c-be7f-b4a9f92b7214.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"NCAA Football 07","Overview":"Another update of EA's perennial NCAA collegiate football franchise, this edition features updated rosters and stats. It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team, the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where players can scout out their new players in exhibition games.\n\nAside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major, follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The player's girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also boost popularity and overall success. Characters can be uploaded to Madden 07 where it can determine their draft position. The game is also aligned with ESPN, updating with real news from ESPN Radio and ESPN.com. It features the voice talents of Lee Corso, Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit.\n\nThe 360 version lacks the Spring Drills and Campus Legend modes. Instead it has improved graphics and a series of mini-games.","Publisher":"EA Sports","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-17T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NCAA_Football_07"},"140960":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"d3630d8e-c372-4420-b87c-a1439c830101.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5eda2267-fbf2-4c24-8f33-81b34b825df4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"143dcd9d-280e-42c4-bcb7-9db87e903d16.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"627de725-ba8f-4ffc-a1a4-ae50d8598c2c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"NBA 10: The Inside","Overview":"NBA 10: The Inside is a basketball simulation game exclusive to the PSP and the follow-up to NBA 09: The Inside as an entry to Sony's NBA franchise.

There are however several differences: new elements are available, there are more customization options for the hero creation, the enemies can be fought head-on, without having to touch them to engage in battle, and dropped items don't need to picked-up manually; simply moving close to them sends the items in the inventory. The Quick Time events from the previous game are still there, but they are not necessary to defeat the bosses. They are rather an opportunity to collect rarer materials by destroying some monster parts. The visual style is also less realistic, some cut-scenes are even cell-shaded. Mercenaries, one of which can be set to resurrect the hero when needed, can now be hired to aid the hero in his quest.\n\nLike in other hunting games, the various weapons allow a variety of combo attacks, but magic can be cast in the middle of a combo. Weapons and armors are crafted with the various materials gathered from the different enemies and bosses. Different quests are available to power up the hero and gather resources.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2011-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"140970":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ivolgamus","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"d0b82fde-a683-417a-8caf-9f53cfb109a4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"03fab598-60da-454b-9870-f5a8a8e33c4e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15a0bdc8-bea4-4dd2-9d83-d8fa23dc61f9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b252b1ed-94d7-4a83-b1ee-8987142ec67c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e3bc2e55-378d-4577-b1e8-06ad921c7dc6.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fa8af0d2-9863-4866-be2a-3905fa7b486a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"}],"Name":"King of Pool","Overview":"Join the world of pool sharks and have the opportunity to play in five unique locations.

In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement.\n\nThis only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.\n\nLess innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.\n\nThe game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators.

Kitty heads and fruits drop in pairs from the top of the screen and must be arranged. Connect four pieces of the same color, including at least one fruit, and they will be cleared. Easy mode starts the player at level 1, while hard mode starts the player at level 11.\nAll of the mini-games unlock pictures and parts for the Hello Kitty Gadget, a clock & calendar featuring dozens of Hello Kitty illustrations.

Kyle, the son of the previous game's hero, is trying to find support for an orphanage operated by his parents. On his journey, he comes into contact with a powerful energy source known as Lens. A girl steps out of it, telling Kyle that she is on a quest to find a true hero. Naturally, Kyle is that hero; and very soon, he will have to prove it, when a mysterious woman uses the power of the Lens to revert history, sending Kyle into an alternate universe, in which the ancient Aeth'er Wars were won by a different side...\n\nGameplay-wise, Tales of Destiny 2 is very similar to its predecessors in the series. As before, most of the game is played in a Japanese RPG fashion, with town and dungeon exploration, and random combat. The trademark side-scrolling action-based battles of the series remain intact in this installment; for the first time, a zoom feature allows a more detailed view of combat.\n\nPlayer-controlled characters learn skills of different tiers, which can be chained into combos. Performing combos increases the damage inflicted on the enemy, and provides bonus experience. Powerful special techniques cost TP (technical points) as well as SP (spirit points) to execute.","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"2007-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tales_of_Destiny_2"},"141217":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Tales Studio","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"410b5f59-969f-4784-ba17-c76ea78f5b29.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"07291c27-f051-4325-8f98-1adb117cc30f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b058c02b-25cd-452c-9f91-4400d0217997.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fd31649e-3d59-4bae-9aeb-f5f94b1a32cf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tales of Rebirth","Overview":"In this installment of Tales of... series, you play the role of the 18-year old Veigue, an orphan who grew up in a village together with Claire.

Originally started as a homebrew NES demake of Grand Theft Auto III, it was eventually developed into a full game. The game is set in eighties and the protagonist is a mullet-styled gangster who wreaks havoc in Theftropolis city. It draws many elements from the series it was inspired by, such as the ability to hijack any car, fight on foot with melee and ranged weapons, and shake off the law when too many crimes are committed.\n\nThe main story mode consists of a number of missions that involve heists, extortion, but for instance also helping out Doc Brown from the Back to the Future movies to help repair his time travel car. The game has a quirky style and hectic pace, and is filled to the brim references to popular culture, especially movies, celebrities and other games with many cameo appearances. Next to the main mission various side missions can be taken on or the city can be explored in full at the player's leisure. During certain parts 30 challenges can be triggered where an objective needs to be completed in a short time, such as driving around a tank or getting air time shooting a bazooka. These can later be replayed as arcade challenges from the main menu. In addition there is a free roaming mode with the maximum amount of money right from the start.\n\nThe protagonist, dubbed The Player, can fight with his fists and other melee weapons, or shoot a large variety of guns. There are about 25 in total. These are collected while playing or are bought in shops. There is also a cover system where it is possible to duck behind objects and fire quickly. Any car or bike of the 40 available can be taken over and pedestrians can be mowed down, leaving behind money. The gun targeting has a lock system where it is possible to strafe around an opponent without losing the target direction. Other options include the ability to jump, and pick up and throw objects, including pedestrians. Committing too many crimes raises a threat meter causing the police force to arrive in increasingly larger numbers. The main character can buy various customizations, play arcade games or gamble at the casino. There are five special, permanent power-ups such as \"Speed 'Kills' Shoes\" for faster speed that are discovered or bought throughout the game. Vehicles can be repainted at spray garages, but cops can also be shaken off by collecting cop cloaking devices that make them lose the trail. Health is replenished by collecting hearts or buying food at vending machines.\n\nIn November 2014 Retro City Rampage: DX was launched, a new version for all previous platforms and introducing new platforms. It is a re-mastered version with the ability to switch to the original version of the game in the options. It was originally launched as the initial version for the 3DS platform earlier that year. Changes include faster vehicles, more checkpoints, tutorials, hint screens and tweaked missions, challenges, visual effects, visual enhancements and difficulty. Weapons can be selected from a grid instead of cycling through them and there is a new UI for the handheld version, including zoom, touch and a dynamic camera. There are more video filters options and two additional graphics modes: RETRO+ and 8-BIT. Weapons have been rebalanced and it is now possible to jump right away after shooting. The update also introduces parking garages where 54 cars can be parked.","Publisher":"Vblank Entertainment Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2016-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-ak1Oq71Woo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Retro_City_Rampage"},"143404":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Mobile Police Patlabor: Come Back Mini Pat","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bandai","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"875387f4-4687-487d-8d1e-e7e78a47d518.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"413f61b4-538d-4655-86ee-fffe755b8078.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: Comeback Mini Pato","Overview":"Patlabor: Come Back Mini-Pato is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2005.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"143405":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Mobile Suit Gundam: Gihren's Greed - The Axis Menace V"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"BEC","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c6c6effd-1385-478f-8468-f43e94ac36a1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1bb174be-35f3-4ae7-af10-46ab60bf0529.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Gihren no Yabou - Axis no Kyoui V","Overview":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Gihren no Yabou - Axis no Kyoui V is a Strategy game, developed by Bec and published by Bandai Namco Games, which was released in Japan in 2009.

Sure, she may have reacted by becoming a bloodthirsty, vengeful spirit responsible for the deaths of countless other children, as well as their erasures from history, but everyone knows that in her heart of hearts, she’s just an ordinary, innocent little 7-year-old…right?\n\nWell, no. Because you see, today is her birthday! She’ll be turning…7 again, naturally. But in celebration, she’s decided to grant all her victims 24 hours of amnesty from their suffering by gathering them all together for a…hysteric? birthday bash. There will be party games, entertainment, adventure, and most of all, romance!\n\nJoin Sachiko and the lovable cast of damned souls from previous Corpse Party games—along with a few new faces—as they take the very concept of genre and toss it aside. Prepare to experience terror, discomfort, joviality, and confusion in equal measure as Heavenly Host Elementary plays less-than-heavenly host to cooking contests, co-ed mixers, interpretive stage drama, traditional party games, and Lovecraftian horrors alike.\n\nBecause you know what they say: Hell hath no fury like a 7-year-old girl bored…\n\nA (surprisingly) canonical “midquel” to Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, taking place sometime during the course of those games, Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash recounts the bizarre events of vengeful ghost girl Sachiko Shinozaki’s one-of-a-kind birthday party held in the otherworldly school where so many lives have been lost in previous games: Heavenly Host Elementary.\n\nThe game plays out as a visual novel, divided into eight main chapters that each detail a different activity or cluster of activities. Player decisions determine which of the game’s endings is attained, with only one true ending from each chapter leading into the next. Surviving to the end will require thinking like Sachiko and making the choices that will please her the most…but with the fewest casualties.","Publisher":"5pb","ReleaseDate":"2012-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"143494":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"12426f34-294e-49ba-9232-566cd5f1071c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bdc57286-7bc2-4d02-af5a-1038a69c3058.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tokimeki Memorial 4","Overview":"Tokimeki Memorial 4 is a Simulation game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2009.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2009-12-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"143668":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Bandai Namco Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e23921e7-f0c2-430a-ad25-a31f7ab07f86.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8e8e5481-d192-4118-a883-f878494edade.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"SD Gundam G Generation World","Overview":"SD Gundam G Generation World is a Strategy game, developed and published by Bandai Namco Games, which was released in Japan in 2011.","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"143669":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Bandai Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"3e76b509-9097-4e06-8e6c-03e021b253d0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"966c228f-6114-437d-a63f-6444ae644c2c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SD Gundam G Generation Portable","Overview":"SD Gundam G Generation Portable is a Strategy game, developed by Namco Bandai Games and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2006.","Publisher":"Bandai","ReleaseDate":"2006-08-03T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"143670":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Quiz Mobile Suit Gundam: Warrior Question DX","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Crafts & Meister","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Quiz","Images":[{"FileName":"4d7174fa-ec9f-4eea-ba7c-ed7c0474a1c7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2b32d87f-8422-4e5a-aa49-63851aefc212.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Quiz Kidou Senshi Gundam: Toi Senshi DX","Overview":"Quiz Kidou Senshi Gundam: Toi Senshi DX is a Quiz game, developed by Crafts & Meister and published by Bandai Namco Games, which was released in Japan in 2006.","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"146981":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Gensou Suikoden 1 and 2","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"幻想水滸伝I&II","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"b3fa9bcd-24ef-41a5-9a13-3722d05aac35.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8da3a6ba-4cf3-45f3-ae1a-abdad4cbc40d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8fb0a98e-6e01-4769-bf39-dba80cf1f53a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"008228fa-3e3f-4c98-b27e-2f6d577c5ccd.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Genso Suikoden I & II","Overview":"This is a re-release of two Playstation RPGs, which are loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Shuihuzhuan (\"Water Margin\").\n\nIn Suikoden, you play as the son of an imperial general, who joins a rebel organization and finds himself and his father fighting for the opposite camps.\n\nIn Suikoden II, you are a young soldier who accidentally discovers that his captain is guilty of treason.

For convenience we'll refer to the update as Shadow Ninja, which isn't really a translation of the Japanese title, but would probably make a decent localized name, if any North American or European publisher had decided to publish this outside of Japan (they haven't). The title actually translates to something like \"Go the hell the way you believe in!\", or something like that - it's a rather impolite and direct command. With Shadow Ninja being steeped in Japanese culture, containing heavy emphasis on Ukiyo-e artwork and similarly appropriate music, its release in the West never happened. Even so it is an ingenious concept backed by some beautiful aesthetics and, despite some fairly major flaws later on, is still worth looking at alongside its Flash originator.\n\nThe concept of Onore (and its Flash precursor) is simple: you are given 10 ninjas (lives) and need to traverse 16 floors, each connected by stairs and filled with various objects to increase points, traps to steal lives, plus switches, keys and other hotspots used to activate the next set of stairs. Think of each floor as an individual puzzle, which sometimes interacts with another floor through use of switches or a key which needs shlepping to a lock three floors up. Each ninja though only has roughly 60 seconds to do his thing, before that \"session\" ends and you take control of a fresh ninja. As the sessions increase up until the final 10th, all the previously used ninjas will continuously replay their lives - and here lies the puzzle element, since some ninjas' sole purpose will be to stand on a switch thereby allowing those that follow to access whatever's now unlocked. Others will need to disable traps by impaling themselves on spikes, kamikaze style. In this way it joins the small genre of temporal-themed puzzle games, alongside Echoshift and TimeSlip.","Publisher":"From Software","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vyTpoX01lm8"},"149848":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CyberFront","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"6530a0a7-ec85-4d74-ac3d-bebc4e510d01.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2cc2c12-2f19-4c3e-a6f5-270a35c343ba.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e0934987-ab97-430d-a1ab-453cf9dafbcb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"33c4f419-0ea5-4f2a-abdb-b0fac93581d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2c33c491-a5d8-46ef-aed7-9ffb2ee3fbe8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"07f0217d-d495-4b4b-a240-d7547838dbb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Never7: The End of Infinity","Overview":"You play as Makoto, a student who never attends the lectures at the school.

The original 8-bit Bomberman also appears in full pixelated 3D glory.\n\nThe game itself plays much like any other Bomberman game: Drop bombs to trap and destroy enemies, blow up crates for power-up items, avoid the various hazards on each stage, and try not to get blown up yourself. The story mode sees each member of the Bombermen team play first through several Classic stages as their blocky retro equivalent to regain their powers, then on to more dangerous Arrange stages as their sentai hero form. In Arrange modes, each Bomber has their own unique abilities: Pink Bomber, for example, can jump over blocks and other hazards with proper timing.\n\nThe other single-player mode is Challenge mode. This mode is a timed race to score as many points as possible over multiple stages within a strict time limit. There is, of course, also wifi multiplayer for up to five players, and even minigames that can be played by linking with I.Q Mania and XI Coliseum.

The game can be considered a slimmed down version of MLB 2006. It has the standard game modes, Quick Game, Season Mode as well as a Multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other using the Ad Hoc.\n\nSome of the new gameplay mechanics for the game areRelease Point Pitching with Confidence meter which would determine the success rate of the pitcher depending on the stats and skill of the player. The more successful pitches made within a certain zone, the easier the pitches become, missing them cause wild pitches or pitch a line drive right to the batter.\n\nAnother is the Playmaker Fielding Marker, where unlike other games this one used the players stats to determine if regular plays like pop-ups would be considered easy by giving the player ample opportunity by showing the landing location faster and giving it a more wider area. Less skilled players would be given less of a warning and a smaller catching radius, making even the simplest plays more challenging.\n\nThe Branch Point Technology introduced a seamless flow of transition for the game that allowed the player to plan out the direction of a throw while still in the process of catching it and was also used for baserunning that gave it a smoother feel to running and sliding.","Publisher":"SCEA","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"153259":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SCE Studios San Diego","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"9b4f696f-33bd-4f8d-8389-c87ea58fe2b2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"96554d12-68d7-401f-bb48-136bd1aa695d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0c043d53-68da-4f10-8445-0131db212ed4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b234b99-6f5a-4aff-9c92-6e0b25446c55.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e208feff-105c-4010-ba07-4b196682bec9.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"fada0ce3-af66-4527-a578-db916176f9d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"42f25a58-3762-4bc0-bbec-d6c325aa09a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"MLB 08: The Show","Overview":"An update of the previous year, along with the obligatory roster update along with new features.

He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll.

I couldn’t find a reason why the game got cancelled by Sumo Digital; the game is hardly mentioned anywhere. Game also doesn’t show up on old cached webpages of Sumo Digital’s website. In May 2006 Sony and Sumo Digital made some actual pre-production Isle of Minno UMDs, none intended for resale, but you can now easily find a leaked ISO online.\n\nSome of the actual UMD copies even ended up on ebay and were selling for around $ 100. The dumped prototype looks to be a fully playable demo, with even a multiplayer and game sharing option.\n\nThe game starts off  with a small sequence showing a boy who washes up ashore on an island after drifting in the sea with some leftovers from a ship. After a small walk on the beach he enters a cave and finds a small village hidden in a valley at the end, presumably called Leafy Cove. After a short introduction talk from an elder person you are sent on your first mission to get yourself some decent clothes. The town is fully explorable; decent sized with loads of places to go to and now and then you find  inhabitants with which you can interact and accept missions from. After completion of a mission you’re invited over to the person’s house or you can collect a small reward for your efforts. The whole gameplay mainly seems to consist of completing small mini games like collecting feathers, fruit or other stuff, mowing lawns, throwing things out threes and of some music memory games.  The complete story of the game or its missions stays however vague.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":2006},"157537":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"シャイニング・アーク","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Media.Vision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"428b4395-ce7e-4816-899e-a828987ed3e9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e599bc9e-44c2-49d4-b390-9ac66e238816.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a88a550c-2835-4a6c-8f44-9b1b45205bec.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shining Ark","Overview":"Shining Ark (シャイニング・アーク) is a role-playing video game developed by Media.Vision and published by Sega for the PlayStation Portable.

Just like in the original game the player controls a hurricane in an attempt to steer polluted clouds into cleansing factories, to create cleaner air and thwart global warming. Polluted clouds are sent out gradually and these are drawn towards the hurricane that can move about freely on the screen. By moving the hurricane and keeping track of all pollution, the clouds need to be steered into the factories. Borrowing from the mechanics of Tower Defense games, the pollution needs to be moved away from high pressure zones. These zones immediately absorb the pollution and disperse it, adding 10% to the global warming percentage. Similarly, having pollution touch the hurricane yields a 20% percentage. When 100% is reached, Earth is destroyed and the game is over.\n\nThe game consists of 30 levels that are unlocked in six tiers, along with a tutorial. New tiers become available by collecting perfect clear ribbons; clearing stages with 0% percentage. The game has a retro look and all levels are played in single, non-scrolling screens. In later levels multiple pollution appears at once and it often needs to be guided through small passages. Two additional keys allow the player to speed up or speed down the pollution, but this does not affect the entire game time. By completing levels players unlock monitors that give the game a different look. The game also supports anaglyph 3D.\n\nCompared to the mechanics of the first game, the hurricane is no longer restricted to a grid and can be moved around freely at a much faster pace compared to the mouse-based controls in the original game.","Publisher":"YoYo Games Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"157956":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hassey Enterprises, Inc.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"a7e67bec-281f-4a2f-acde-f7e103c41edd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"096d168e-b367-464d-b93a-19340522a4fe.jpg","Region":"Hong Kong","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"445a39f2-8b90-4e18-9e67-525854764aea.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e96ce305-d48f-4fe5-b59d-febde598430f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c0c52ceb-cbd1-4ca0-b728-33c60025b15e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Galcon Labs","Overview":"Conquer the Galaxy like never before!

The story begins in a dreamlike situation where all the girls are in love with you, but in the end, you will have to choose only one. AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. This is the first game in the series and takes place in Tokyo (background images during visual-novel style gameplay are photos from various known locations in Tokyo).\n\nThe game mostly plays like a visual novel which features real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date. During the date part which plays as a visual novel, there will be a dialogue selection which will show the girl you're with if you're rude, indifferent or like her. This in turn may prompt her to contact you again at the beginning of the next day. Some correspondence occurs irregularly when the girl liked how she felt when she was with you on previous dates. Likewise, addresses of the girls you were rude with will disappear from the list until only one remains. Initially, all 48 girls are listed as your potential girlfriends. During special so called escort event scenes, idols will wear a special outfit just for you. Any event scene during visual novel gameplay lets on-screen text be toggled off and allows for certain amount of zooming.\n\nVarious unlockables such as visual cards, event scenes, and steel photos can accessed from the menu, while collected cards can be traded with other players. AKB48 soundtrack does not need to be unlocked and can be listened via BGM player. It additionally lets the player select default BGM song and theme song for each of the ABK48 members. Voice-acting for each of the AKB48 girls in the game is done by AKB48 members.","Publisher":"Bandai Co.,Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2010-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"166692":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"STREETKIX:FREESTYLE"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ilusis Interactive Graphics","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ec5bbcc8-c63a-4980-90ce-2ec9bbd6aad6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"203b3957-335e-4678-906a-1d0139f69f30.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"227ddeb2-38af-4123-9012-58e4389a3684.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8620d682-2785-40eb-98e1-412e70172a1f.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"958d073a-6a8c-4b36-bd6c-dee1b1ca46c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"StreetKix Freestyle","Overview":"StreeKix Freestyle is a game that will challenge your reflexes mixing rhythm, sports and RPG gameplay elements in a Freestyle Soccer themed universe.","Publisher":"Hoplite Research","ReleaseDate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5w4b6VwvIOU"},"166946":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hudson Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"51ee7c3f-b3c5-4741-990a-f6d718baf978.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a4b6bd07-acea-4795-a2f5-56ddb51bdea8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ec5022c8-c71b-4274-9e83-ef26e7ea667a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"021ea9e7-6abe-42fb-aa3a-1f69af34b830.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"PC Engine Best Collection: Soldier Collection","Overview":"This collection includes the four PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16) entries in Hudson Soft's Star Soldier series:\n\n•   Super Star Soldier (1990)\n•   Final Soldier (1991)\n•   Star Parodier (1992)\n•   Soldier Blade (1992)\n\nAlso included are the \"Special Version\" contest versions of Final Soldier and Soldier Blade which were used at Hudson's Games Caravan events, as well as technique and hint videos narrated by Takahashi Meijin.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k6MYQ47-fP8"},"167825":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"ディブァイデッド","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"C's Ware","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Adventure; Horror; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"b05c579c-924c-4194-875a-7d4f804d7e25.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Divi-Dead","Overview":"Life has been rough for Ranmaru Hibikiya.

To aid these children, the Adventurer Academies were founded, to prepare them in their perilous journeys.\n\nPlayers start out at the Particus Academy, the newest of the academies, where they'll be able to assemble their party from students, each hailing from one of the 10 available races, 15 professions and 3 alignments. Each race has a different attitude toward the others, keeping the party compatibility system already featured in the previous games. The academy serves as a home base, where students can modify their team, purchase\/sell equipment, practice alchemy, heal\/revive injured party-members and take on new quests.\n\nThe labyrinths have an overall similar layout, but a few sections are randomly generated upon entrance, so are the enemy and item locations. Battles are turn-based, with a tension gauge slowly filling, allowing the party to unleash Gambits upon their foes. If the whole party is defeated in one of the labyrinths, as a last resort, a rescue team can be sent after them. The longer the rescue team takes to find them, the higher the chance that certain items will be lost, or even party members could die permanently.","Publisher":"Atlus U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-05T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"169198":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zerodiv","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"1352c7ff-3d20-4964-b057-549e33486b46.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e1d0ee0e-ad8d-4187-bff5-6108ab0bbd9c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Shin Ken to Mahou to Gakuen Mono.

This is a remake of Porto Estado for handhelds. \n\nThe fourth game in the series was released for both PlayStation and PC under Windows 2000 and XP. This game returns to the previous formula, although its open-endedness has decreased and the engine has been updated. This title is plot-wise unrelated to the series that ended in Gaiden. Porto Estado is known for its fine art and high-quality illustrations.\n\nThe story evolves on the search of the seven Proof of the Conqueror, which are seven ancient artifacts, in seven areas around the world (Northern Europe, Mediterranean, Africa, New World, Indian Ocean, South Asia and East Asia). It is said that having these proofs proves that the sailor is the champion of all sailors. Four sailors (plus another three in expansion) unwittingly involved in the struggle of the quest of the search of the Proof of the Conqueror. It is interesting that not all sailors are from Europe: two of the seven characters are from Asia (one from East Asia and another from southeast Asia), one from the Caribbean and another one from the Middle East.\n\nThere are many significant changes in this game. For example, the game no longer has the concept of years and the result is that characters in this game will not age. The player can also set up regional fleets and these regional fleets are valuable financial resources. In combat, naval battle is now fought in real time.\n\nThe country boundaries have disappeared. Each character is only represented by their own guild and their home country is not important in gameplay. Ports in this game also have a market share rating in a percentage scale. Players can trade in a port only when his guild has some market share in that port, which can be gained by signing a contract with the local governor.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2006-03-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncharted_Waters"},"170901":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SystemSoft","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"9f23f0be-5a66-4a96-95f6-51bd91f98c1d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"95cd460d-10e9-465e-a70d-1914dbe26b30.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Daisenryaku VII: Exceed","Overview":"Daisenryaku VII: Exceed is a Strategy game, developed and published by SystemSoft, which was released in Japan in 2008.","Publisher":"SystemSoft","ReleaseDate":"2008-05-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"170919":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Key","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"ebf0ecb0-de22-4d54-a078-20f78a36bbb0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"65b169ab-760d-4f93-82d9-6e9ca20d2729.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"23cc0f3c-b9a9-4e57-b1f5-1b8dde46979a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Clannad: Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de Joukan","Overview":"Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de (光見守る坂道で) is a linear visual novel featuring full voice-acting (for dialogues and descriptions alike) that tells 8 stories from the world of Clannad that were not covered in neither anime series nor original game, this release being the first out of two volumes (featuring first 8 out of 16 overall short episodes).

A year ago from the time this game was set, her mother had died from an illness - her father was a famous wizard who died from saving the kingdom when Parfait was young.\n\nAt the beginning, Parfait introduces herself and tells the player that she is almost at the risk of losing her beloved shop (the only remains of her mother), for Parfait has to pay the debt of 1,000,000G (gold) by 12 months to keep the shop running. As a normal shop, there seems no hope for raising the Black Cat Market's fame.\n\nThe player's motive is to collect this debt by 12 months in various ways such as putting cauldron-made potions to the shop counters for customers, accepting potion orders at the end of the day and sell her potions on the street. As Parfait gains more experience via studying in the library or creating potions, her levels will rise (with a maximum of six stars) which enables her to succeed more on potions that are high-leveled.

Using a kind of magical stone, alchemists and magicians were able to make many inventions in the way of magic. This lead to a revolution of enlightenment in magic, and people were trying to make money by harvesting these stones.

A torrent of humans poured into the Demon Realm, causing the Demon King to break his silence and retaliated with war. \n\n    The Human Kingdom was losing terribly, as the human soldiers couldn't stand up against the ranks of the Demon Army. It was then that a hero stepped up and descended into the Demon Realms in order to convince the Demon King to stop by any means possible.

The war stopped due to her efforts, and the kingdom has been saved. \n\n    A dear friend of hers who traveled and battled with her was there on the day when she stopped the Demon King's army, but the two separated in that battle and Isabelle disappeared.

She asked her old friend to take the child and raise her with the humans, and enjoy a normal life as a human. After coming to, he was on the outskirts of the Demon Realm, with a little girl holding his hand. He thus decided to raise the child as his own. Returning to the kingdom, he declined the offer of nobility from the king, and in return asked for a modest little home in which he could raise his daughter. \n\nThe game is heavily dependent on events, the plot aspect of these events will be detailed later.","Publisher":"Jinx","ReleaseDate":"2006-10-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"171450":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"프린세스메이커 5","Region":"Korea"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CyberFront","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"550d99f6-a49e-46e3-9526-849ace4253fc.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d14f4709-c141-4c9a-9b7a-21f8f3feb0ff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc68889e-5c88-4946-b245-2c360665c686.jpg","Region":"Korea","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Princess Maker 5 Portable","Overview":"In the parallel worlds that exist alongside modern Japan, there is unrest in the Human Kingdom, the Realm of Heaven, the Realm of Demons, the Faerie World and the Realm of the Spirits of the Stars.

But the rules change each time you face a new opponent, with a series of new modes (plus the basic modes from the first two \"Puyo\" games and also from \"Puyo Pop Fever\") ready to test your Puyo skills.\n\nIn addition to the traditional story mode, where a single player takes on 8 other characters in hopes of earning the medal, there is also the traditional battle mode, where up to 4 players (8 on the DS version) battle it out (by themselves or in teams) to the last.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2007-03-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"171452":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"HuneX Co., Ltd.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2e07ffe6-9897-447a-a6bd-bfdafae60f32.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"48977596-d856-418e-9c8a-690e48d5a12a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"PW: Project Witch","Overview":"The protagonist is a 4th grader with troubles socializing with his peers.

At first glance, he is a fairly ordinary young man who lives an (almost too) ordinary life. He lives at home with his two sisters, Mizubashou and Shirotsumegusa, constantly gets into arguments with his next door neighbor Hinagiku, goes to school with all three and spends the days enjoying life in a virtually perfect world.\n\nThere are, of course, some oddities. Firstly, the only humanoids in the world seem to be Ichihiko, his older sisters, Hinagiku and their teacher, Kobatomugi-sensei. Everyone else looks like something resembling old sci-fi movie drone robots that communicate by repeating the phrase \"oui monsieur\" known as saberhagen-class droids (and are understood the same way Star Wars characters understand the beeps coming from R2-D2). This is a world where it never rains. Where weather conditions are always convenient. Where Ichihiko's favorite shows are always on TV and his favorite foods are always served. Yes, this world is clearly fake.\n\nAs the story progresses, the player discovers that Ichihiko is actually the \"last mankind\" (in other words, the last human left in the universe). He was found in a stasis capsule by the robots that inhabit the spaceship Saint Exupéry-go. Feeling that he is too young to govern over the ship and perform his role in bringing about the second coming of humanity, the robot R-Mizubashou proposes that he be awakened and raised by them, and that a suitable \"happy\" world be built just for him; a world where he has a loving family, lots of friends and feels no hardships or pain.\n\nHaving been without any humans to serve for nearly a millennium, the robots draw upon on almost every possible source to build what is to be Ichihiko's perfect world. To this end, they have used data from \"older\" robots on board, books, movies and even manga. While the majority of the robots involved willfully continue the ruse (and do everything they can to dispose of dissenters), there are some who wish to tell the \"last mankind\" the truth.","Publisher":"views Co., Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"171454":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kadokawa Games","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"de9d60a7-a1ff-49f4-bb17-e242af49a740.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"70c45607-0f2c-4b23-8f16-aca2a650faf1.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"R-15 Portable","Overview":"The game's story centers around Taketo Akutagawa, a student with a secret: he is a talented pornographic novelist with a newspaper-serialized work.

The characters are taken from the Momoyama period in Japan. In the previous Taikō Risshiden IV, a character was selected from the choices of a samurai, a ninja or a merchant. In Taikō Risshiden V, new roles include a blademaster, a pirate, a doctor, a tea master, and a blacksmith, counting eight roles in total. The player meets various historical figures of the era in the game. \n\nThe game follows the card system used in Taikō Risshiden IV, with new profession added. A number of playable warlords are expanded for each version as 800 for Windows and 860 for the PlayStation 2. Non-combat characters include foreign missionaries, monks, and wives of the military lords. There are four overseas bases where pirates and merchants can travel to: Naha (Ryukyu, now part of Japan), Busan (Korea), Ningbo (Ming China), and Luzon (in the Philippines).\n\nThe military commander graphics were changed from the manga style of version III and IV to a graphic novel, or gekiga style, adopted from the format employed in a title named Nobunaga's Ambition. While each internal affairs and training sessions were settled in mini-games in Taikō Risshiden IV unless you change option in PlayStation 2 edition or later, in this version it is possible to opt out and skip those mini-games. However, when the player skips those mini-games, technical points will not be gained on ability score, and there are events that the player is challenged with the mini-games, even when opted to skip them.

The characters are taken from the Momoyama period in Japan. In the previous Taikō Risshiden IV, a character was selected from the choices of a samurai, a ninja or a merchant. In Taikō Risshiden V, new roles include a blademaster, a pirate, a doctor, a tea master, and a blacksmith, counting eight roles in total. The player meets various historical figures of the era in the game. \n\nThe game follows the card system used in Taikō Risshiden IV, with new profession added. A number of playable warlords are expanded for each version as 800 for Windows and 860 for the PlayStation 2. Non-combat characters include foreign missionaries, monks, and wives of the military lords. There are four overseas bases where pirates and merchants can travel to: Naha (Ryukyu, now part of Japan), Busan (Korea), Ningbo (Ming China), and Luzon (in the Philippines).\n\nThe military commander graphics were changed from the manga style of version III and IV to a graphic novel, or gekiga style, adopted from the format employed in a title named Nobunaga's Ambition. While each internal affairs and training sessions were settled in mini-games in Taikō Risshiden IV unless you change option in PlayStation 2 edition or later, in this version it is possible to opt out and skip those mini-games. However, when the player skips those mini-games, technical points will not be gained on ability score, and there are events that the player is challenged with the mini-games, even when opted to skip them.

You've known the secret.\nThere is a story of a boy who can see AYAKASHI, not visible to human eye.”\n\nIn the present world, crime rates keep on increasing every day. This is happening because evil spirits have crossed over from the spirit world to the human world. These spirits are invisible to the naked eyes. One day, Yūto Ishigami was pushed out of the third floor's window by a classmate who suddenly turned violent, but he miraculously survived without a single scratch. However, since that day, Yuuto began to see strange things. These strange things are known as \"Ayakashi\". The fact that he's seeing them is proof that the ability that was sleeping within him has been awakened.\n\nAs Yūto, the player will explore the school and look for objects that might be occupied by a spirit. Once the player finds an object that is believed to be possessed, the player can take a picture of it with the mobile phone. Each time the player takes a photo, 5 minutes of in-game time pass. During battles, the player can send an e-mail from the mobile phone with a particular picture attached to it to summon the respective spirit to aid Yūto.[2]\n\nTsukumonogatari emphasizes the \"power of words\" as part of its battle system. Yūto’s school is populated by several people, including his friends and the school staff themselves. The player can go around talking to different people at school, and engaging in conversation with them. Occasionally, they’ll narrate a proverb or a rumor or a myth to the player. These are \"words\".\n\nDifferent \"words\" can be attached to spirits during battles to give them various abilities, and they are vital when battling against the Ayakashi. When a battle begins, the player will be able to summon a spirit and add up to a maximum of three \"words\" to it to decide what abilities it will possess in battle.","Publisher":"FURYU Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tsukumonogatari"},"172245":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NetRevo","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"5badfda6-28f3-4b99-aabd-4d7ecbf9d1e8.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4b00931a-c877-4c38-aa17-cb22cb6a5de2.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tsuyo Kiss 2: Gakki Portable","Overview":"A retelling of Tsuyokiss which takes place a few months after Otome has started living together with Leo (before the game enters any routes) and introduces the transfer student, Celeb, who joined Leo's class.","Publisher":"NetRevo","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"172246":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NCS","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"28716cb4-d1af-4968-87b3-5433d45c55ca.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"afd2569d-f281-44bc-af48-91d98aa4f341.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Umezawa Yukari no Yasashii Igo","Overview":"Umezawa Yukari no Yasashii Igo is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by NCS, which was released in Japan in 2008.","Publisher":"NCS","ReleaseDate":"2008-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"172247":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alchemist","Genres":"Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"c6684e2f-2a99-4778-a9a1-406330d18488.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0e3e3ac9-0070-4ac9-90c4-d24d176ffdf3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Umineko no Naku Koro ni Portable 1","Overview":"Umineko no Naku Koro ni takes place in the year 1986 during the time frame of October 4 and October 5 on a secluded island named Rokkenjima (六軒島).

The eggs can only be manipulated when outside of the \"nest\" (the play area), which is accomplished by sliding the selected row of eggs to the left or right using the dpad. The order of the three eggs pushed out of the nest can be cycled left or right using the X and O buttons, respectively. The current row can be changed with the up and down directions on the dpad allowing them to be re-inserted on a different row to form lines of matching eggs.\n\nOnce a line of four eggs is formed a \"hatch\" is begun, giving the player a short time to create more lines of eggs to form a combo to score more points before the eggs hatch. When the \"hatch\" timer is up any eggs that formed part of a line will hatch and the little Piyos will fly off to collect on either side of the screen. An egg will hatch even if it is no longer part of a line of matching eggs, so long as it is not being held outside of the nest. The remaining eggs will fall to fill in the gaps. When enough points are scored the player's level increases.\n\nAn additional dimension is added to the controls by the use of the Sixaxis controller's motion-sensing abilities. By shaking the Sixaxis from side-to-side the eggs can be shaken to fall into gaps. Shaking the controller up-and-down will cause the eggs to jump about offering limited control in re-ordering the eggs beyond manipulating them three-at-a-time beyond the nest. If a hatch has started, shaking the controller will cause the eggs to hatch immediately. The maneuver can be particularly useful in the battle mode when the eggs are getting close to filling the nest, which would result in the end of the game.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2010-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Piyotama"},"173541":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Exkee","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"778fc1dc-8b6f-4636-afe4-786b44a5e639.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b39fdd15-52cc-4d93-93a3-20305f96e5cc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5233080c-ca70-4689-9926-2f9646db9d27.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7245ec08-8996-47d3-8c1d-b74cfebe1c77.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c37640d5-69e2-4704-8d90-5d1a2ed552f6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"be453826-5a87-4314-a090-1c2649432e43.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Voodoo Dice","Overview":"Roll the dice in a mystical world filled with exploration, puzzle solving, and adventure.

It was originally released in 1996 for the Neo Geo MVS arcade platform. The game is widely known for its sense of humor, fluid hand-drawn animation, and fast-paced two-player action.\n\nThe player(s) must shoot constantly at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of each level. At this point, the player confronts a boss, who is usually considerably larger and tougher than regular enemies. On the way through each level, the player can find numerous weapon upgrades and \"Metal Slug\" tanks. The tank is known as the SV-001 (\"SV\" stands for Super Vehicle), which not only increases the player's offense, but considerably adds to their defense.\n\nIn addition to shooting, the player can also perform melee attacks by using a knife. The player does not die simply by coming into contact with enemies, and correspondingly, many of the enemy troops also have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is also destructible, and occasionally, this reveals extra items or power-ups, although most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.\n\nDuring the course of a level, the player also encounters POWs, who, if freed, offer the player bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. At the end of each level, the player receives a scoring bonus based on the number of freed POWs. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs reverts to zero.\n\nThere are a total of six levels, in locations such as forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases. The vast majority of enemies are soldiers equipped with weaponry befitting their specific role. There are also several mechanized enemies, such as tanks, mobile artillery, aircraft, armored personnel carriers and technicals. Much of the game's humor comes from how the enemies are depicted; the player often encounters them as they are sunbathing, roasting food over a fire, or simply conversing amongst themselves. They also tend to scream loudly if they see the player, and often try to either run away or fight back.\n\nThe American version changed the color of the soldiers' blood from red to white.","Publisher":"SNK Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2010-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Slug_(1996_video_game)"},"186222":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Romance of the Three Kingdoms","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Koei","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"8ed9b3b8-0349-4ff4-8552-b0791942d908.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"88a17de7-8d30-4058-8b59-6490ed9fcb6b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"San Goku Shi V","Overview":"The series are based on the romanticized Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel and the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms, the storyline takes place during the Han Dynasty in China with many warring factions that included the Shu Han, Cao Wei and Eastern Wu kingdoms. Gameplay revolves around managing numerical statistics, each representing an attribute of a city or a character. A city is described by statistics such as stored grain supplies, vulnerability to disasters such as floods and earthquakes, treasury funds, domestic affairs and populace loyalty. Characters are numerically characterized by their leadership abilities, melee prowess, intellects and loyalty, as well as special traits or even magical abilities that can be called upon whether during wartime, diplomacy or domestic affairs. Players can increase these numbers before waging war on neighbouring territories or intending diplomatic efforts.\n\nWhile generally presented as a turn-based strategy game, the seventh, eighth and tenth editions offer role-playing features, allowing the player to play as a rank-and-file character instead of leading a kingdom.\n\nSeveral spin-offs based on the series include the tactical action hack and slash video game Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Tactics which is a hybrid of Dynasty Warriors and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as well as the three tactical role-playing games Sangokushi Eiketsuden (Liu Bei), Sangokushi Koumeiden (Zhuge Liang), and Sangokushi Sousouden (Cao Cao).
