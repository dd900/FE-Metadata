Convinced that if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise up against the current regime. The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze.\n\nThe player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms. The view of the game is isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they were in without having to replay the previous levels. There are no life bars, instead the player can take four hits before their character dies with five lives. After losing these five lives, the game will be over.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNIECnkS6I","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Eden Entertainment Software","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"2feafe2f-a788-4144-adf9-bb0134882788.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"5cac814d-d533-4433-a484-0baed96d6378.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"8a7c04c3-cd2f-4e66-9dfb-54dd934a9fcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"d3240ec8-d747-4b9b-9ab2-119cc1e4f47f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"a69fb2a4-4147-4608-b361-18907d9a9936.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"f0c5e84b-e1c3-4f49-b1b8-bf46213f67c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"7b3a721e-b0b3-4ba1-b897-ad40fb2ab2c3.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"90e4e90e-c33d-4634-b167-bf810d9990a8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"ef00565d-9b4a-4278-a277-372cb037d92c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"cb16632c-4d13-4092-84b5-124dcbcc8bd4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"f113c1f0-35f3-455c-a49a-f2933f73f7de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11835,"FileName":"b5b8bb04-59d7-4d35-807f-9eb2cbaf0c4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":11835,"AlternateName":"Arena","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11835,"AlternateName":"Arena: Maze of Death ~ Arena","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":11836,"Name":"Ariel: The Little Mermaid","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Disney's Ariel: The Little Mermaid is an Action game, developed by Blue Sky Software and published by Sega, which was released in 1992.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhr30i3gLCo","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"BlueSky Software","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"8ad6d44f-a013-4605-86cc-a85af878100d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"f5e98a70-67e0-4647-96b2-bebccc71e94b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"432d083d-0665-42b5-9d00-12976118499a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"f8b8f29c-4d5b-41a9-9bd0-0a972e56a074.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"d37cd279-2a87-4ca3-9874-9459269ffc92.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"1121c69a-ea14-4085-8489-084f562cfd94.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"dafd19cf-f0d1-4711-833e-f9b5a894c4a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"94903bf3-0453-4b10-841b-ed1355b02c96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"13436c0a-d6f2-45c5-a0f9-fe19a62381d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":11836,"FileName":"1750a03d-7ee4-4741-90a4-1d0254c1df6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11837,"Name":"Astérix and the Great Rescue","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"The game is based on the popular French comics series Astérix.

Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer.\n\nAt the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular.

However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.\n\nGameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: \"battle\" (attack), \"retreat\", \"spell\" and \"monster\". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the \"monster\" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ylN6ASyjeE","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"d7b3da2f-2e25-452e-b56d-1b3db4bcb595.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"9b46a54f-3d3c-421a-bfba-07fcf3a90075.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"05965f28-a8eb-4bc7-82b9-8c584ab4213c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"a29cca0d-4a1f-412b-b2f2-ab713884e218.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"819d637b-b169-4b47-be34-117ad60c7e23.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"29394f8c-388c-40c5-a500-46e3b9f096e3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"6a6d303c-f95a-4d6e-a8d0-5401c8173c3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"6c15ec21-6713-4fba-9f62-b32647a2caf1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"8ad68cce-5d21-4ece-bb1a-0ec2ec2004fc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"d4b3f77b-ce03-4757-b218-22c3eda5af41.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"a9c42e72-0030-4e04-a933-be15c6ba83a9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"34c73d3d-c8e3-4939-859d-a8b44ac61448.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"95fc330a-935b-4166-ac39-3f4706b8b692.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"5ce0be45-ad48-470c-9314-262230e57b0f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15969,"FileName":"6e7da271-e9c0-4792-83e3-dcd7c17f3024.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":15969,"AlternateName":"Arliel: Crystal Densetsu","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":24284,"Name":"Cutthroat Island","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sharpen your long swords for the ultimate high seas battle!

Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.\n\nAfter the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.\n\nThe first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrjrT9JiUJc","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"ce3059e0-3995-4f37-abbb-87475968b76c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"a0434008-489c-414d-ae84-6e66ce07b874.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"77d82f71-0833-4117-93be-195285b71ef4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"c7aaab8d-09b9-4961-8e22-a7fda17a42e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"5ee18456-bc22-4acc-a97f-d5fae99efa0e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"beeb1ac0-901c-4711-9973-6ae542868b62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"f27cb0c7-214d-474e-939b-9eaece438d2d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"7a9e5e17-6c72-4c40-aaad-3c7448b1c4b5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"6d227249-1b21-42c9-a62c-b83e66609928.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"ee8ce8e0-5beb-466f-b35c-f5d9ab5746ee.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"8ec6af34-4fa5-48a6-9d47-a2a15c6a76ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"bc582e9a-1080-403c-925b-932b1e725761.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"5aebdea0-25cb-453b-beb7-64a4f6ae6c37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21318,"FileName":"fe5ef229-2bba-487c-b042-7ae5856bbd24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27380,"Name":"Kaitou Saint Tail","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kaitō Saint Tail is a 2D top-down arcade game with several puzzle-solving minigames.

This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.\n\nThe game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:\n\nMode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.\n\nThe game has numerous cameos from Opa-Opa of Fantasy Zone fame.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"73292351-5a9a-4c54-b563-00f20337e155.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"3cf8d3bb-b393-4803-bf17-f199eb1e13ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"c3654c61-4189-4fe5-b8cc-cb677b5f1099.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"2da5b865-8ba0-4936-8ba0-b40d8b1d3c62.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"c05cd439-b1f2-44d7-b7bc-d6741ebffae6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"c6daab68-ee92-4690-b3de-669828898bec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":27381,"FileName":"03328063-e123-4627-94b6-4ed7522a42a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19235,"Name":"Kishin Douji Zenki","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Kishin Dōji Zenki is based on a TV and anime series.

In present time, this demon spirit, called Zenki, appears again, after having been sealed in a column by Enno Ozuno - Zenki was freed by Ozuno's descendant in present day, a school girl called Chiaki Enno. However, Zenki has only the form of an ill-mannered child, and Chiaki can only transform him into a useful form by using a magic bracelet. Together, Zenki and Chiaki must avert the threat caused by the seeds of Karuma, who started to appear and transform people into monsters.\n\nThe game is a platformer which lets you control either Chiaki or Zenki, which both have different abilities. While Chiaki can break stones with her powers to clear the way and look for power ups, Zenki has spinning attack. Like in Sega's Astérix games, you choose at the beginning of each level which character to play. Further, the level can be left to pick the other one. For boss fights, the game switches to a different mode reminiscent of one-on-one fighting games, where Zenki faces the opponent in a more powerful form.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtPgbj4BEI8","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Sega CS R&D","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1995-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"f695364c-fc64-4666-8f15-31c95a16cecb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"a1d30dd1-ea80-40e4-891e-a80b29507547.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"7c2cb823-6570-421d-afe5-cb15d956f684.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"f0148e13-5aa0-497f-bc2c-1345350a431d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"d9b7fc40-2780-43c7-b8b1-4206ee56710f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"ea0b66e6-e460-4929-95fb-49dff673e09e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"2fedc610-24fd-4427-9b9b-d93194aa5ec9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"3a3e34c9-8fa6-43ca-899b-806c06900eb0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"54d6fc1b-28be-4887-af17-9a8d438abd88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"f9b5edc1-6369-4ffc-be62-24bba4781e9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"cdea16e0-382a-4c8a-bba1-478b08cf0dcc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"05ca23b1-0cad-4546-ab19-e118881142ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"7005b128-d5e6-44f7-97e3-3cf6131490bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":19235,"FileName":"e30d5e7c-bc02-4cca-a188-a8ed746ac049.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":19235,"AlternateName":"Demon Child Zenki","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19235,"AlternateName":"Kishin Dōji Zenki","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":25124,"Name":"Klax","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"KLAX - the latest, greatest hit in the arcades - is now available for play on the GameGear!

Destructible blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power ups.

The player controls the ECO32-5 Cyborg and must fight all the other robots in the plant until finally meeting the Supervisor Droid. The controls consist of 3 buttons for punches and 3 buttons for kicks (one for each in the Game Gear version), and jumping, moving, crouching and blocking are performed with the directional pad. The Cyborg has two super moves, the Turbo Head Butt and the Shoulder Barge. The player can choose the difficulty, number of rounds and time limit for the fights, as well as turn turn the super moves off.\n\nThe game has three modes: mission, where the player fights each robot in a fixed order; training, where the player can fight any robot in any desired order; and two players versus mode (absent in the Game Gear version), where the second player chooses any of the enemy robots to fight with.

The series started on the Mega Drive and made its way to various other systems over the years. The game's title is based on the slang term for the severe friction burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the ground at high speed.\n\nIn an attempt to improve on the basic Hang-On concept, where the player's vehicle remains on the same horizontal plane and turns are essentially a matter of moving left or right, Road Rash requires that players contend with various grade changes. The physics reflect the act of going up or down a hill, as well as turning while climbing; this results in the ability to launch one's motorcycle great distances, resulting in crashes (and their animations). Aside from this, Road Rash has a standard system of obstacles including street signs, trees, poles, and livestock; and taking from OutRun, active traffic while racing against other bikers.\n\nWhat Road Rash really brings to the table is \"brawling\"; the player can fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or simple punches and kicks. The player initially starts off with just those basics, but can grab a weapon from another rider by timing a punch correctly. The list of weapons has grown with the games, starting from the clubs in the first Road Rash, and eventually including things like crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Whatever the weapon, successful attacks damage an opponent's stamina, and depleting this stamina will cause a biker to wipeout which can also damage the bike; this functions much like hitting a car or other major obstacle, and it all applies to you as much as to other racers (though in most of the games, you have more stamina than opponents).\n\nAs mentioned before, the last and most major obstacle are cops. The motorcycle police officers fight the player as another opponent and serve as gameplay enforcers by culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the world rather than race in it. Losing a fight with an officer or being caught by one while off one's motorcycle causes the player to be Busted, ending the race.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt9uGfb2uRI","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Racing","Developer":"Probe","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"57b03db6-2122-4b65-92cd-f87a224956f9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"cb8a703b-d284-4034-a5d3-aab562d0e756.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"89a1990f-3103-41fb-b3c8-7dc863d15c59.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"b3c91098-3677-4222-a979-75092ee1e8b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"b4fcde28-9483-46a4-b88f-d6a3a273a1e0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"144831b9-a9a9-4fb5-8952-bf4cca89bab9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"4bb3b4e1-64be-46e1-8d3c-61d1e722c59c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"e2019843-1d4f-44d5-b448-6c2a60859181.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"63cd3b9f-cfb0-4c26-9e4d-bb715d111fb7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"159057a7-421e-42ce-918d-0dd4dee66a75.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"c6b89ceb-3735-4e71-b110-3155712f6284.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"1ccfa565-3504-4d99-88e7-bf072af0bb68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19992,"FileName":"9317cfeb-469f-4396-8320-5dcc6a99e87c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25196,"Name":"RoboCop 3","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Old Detroit.

The players will race around a track against the other three characters for a top position, using 2 to accelerate, 1 to brake and the latter combined with a direction allows to drift corners, though abusing it will send the character into spinning out of control. Going out of the asphalt track drops the speed immediately and in the sidelines there are several obstacles that will stop the character altogether if they are hit. The Up direction on the directional pad can use rings collected on the track as a special move, unique to each character.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"ce2732d6-076e-428a-8bab-e7608e93ab72.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"a6accdc4-fbd3-4ec2-a50b-b104cea52d1b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"7ada14a6-0cb0-476e-814e-7d466452a442.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"62eb0e2a-0c3e-4851-bfce-e73369c8ba5c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"6c57cc39-7f62-405d-973b-d36734c48e4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"660c8649-9cf5-40d3-8786-fb81b6e2596b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"21d5f76c-5575-4322-b500-a794a9b545df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":26760,"FileName":"fc05c3fa-479e-4a7c-9c6a-a4c3abdcd9d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19062,"Name":"Sonic Drift 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Start your engines and prepare for the race of your life!

The main premise of the game is set on a football field, choosing plays on either offense or defense they than are answered a series of sports-related trivia questions. Answering more questions correctly in a certain amount of time will determine how well their quarterback will pass or how many yards their running back will gain. Alternatively, the same applies to the defense where if a player answers more trivia questions correctly, the better the chance of a sack, interception, etc.\n\nThere are eleven different sports categories that range from football, baseball, hockey and boxing clear up to college sports and even auto racing. Each question is given in multiple choice format and players are allowed five audibles (an alternate question) for each half. The player has the option of either competing against the computer A.I. or against a friend.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"Adrenalin Entertainment","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"34663088-b5e0-4dc1-9e8e-a3a741cfc979.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"8dfc2baa-d653-4e12-a91a-b1684acd05da.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"71d8e145-18a1-4dc2-a609-f8fca302b991.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"16bd5013-ee48-4052-b6e8-1cb282dba43d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"59ab8432-56d3-415f-9dce-ec3c851d2c81.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"750f6e43-08f9-4ae5-b121-038df61c8b67.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"a8595120-6d0e-4930-bbec-fe343e017d61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25221,"FileName":"50caacad-6268-42b0-badd-6f8c560a251a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25222,"Name":"Star Trek: Generations: Beyond the Nexus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.\n\nThe game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.\n\nOn away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.\n\nFinally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.\n\nThe second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Absolute Entertainment","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"46c30f44-d99d-4d11-850a-e6a949c7681d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"39792060-d811-4b8e-b1a0-6868bc62714a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"fb52034d-e07e-436f-bdab-7539169ab6f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"23c59481-aa8c-4a5e-93d7-d31cdda5bc12.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"922a3d54-6532-4d76-8e0b-0d2c4bf3a8ab.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"1ad23523-55c9-4ea8-b0b6-fdeb5de4aeb6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"7e4d647a-47bb-4430-a822-768acae88c39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25222,"FileName":"7bcf1167-7975-4516-9473-5517891b58f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":25223,"Name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation: Advanced Holodeck Tutorial","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Star Trek: TNG - AHT, the player will partake in a holodeck simulation on the U.S.S.

It has also been spotted under the name Street Blaster.\n\nThere is not thought to be an original Jang Pung, however it did receive a sequel in the form of Jang Pung 3.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxbG1iduLrE","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Open Corp.","Publisher":"Sieco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"f2689fea-d395-44dc-89f9-19664b3ad783.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"c506b039-1d54-455e-9725-4e33f65a9cb5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"b284b979-c3c7-4fe6-9bf3-7673ccae5e95.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"0d087b8e-e233-42d8-8142-d3d036bb815f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"96c342a1-2d43-45f6-a109-1df9e1524381.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"e72a3d4f-889e-40b4-8a2f-a5d312c12522.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"FileName":"eb9d2f88-e697-4c6c-87b9-b0a1af5dc114.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Korea"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":119074,"AlternateName":"Street Battle","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":119074,"AlternateName":"Jang Pung II","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119074,"AlternateName":"Street Blaster","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":119074,"AlternateName":"Street Fighter","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":133296,"Name":"Street Hero","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Janggun-ui Adeul (the official English title for the films is The General's Son), a gangster movie trilogy that could be called the Korean answer to The Godfather, to sum it up in one short sentence.\n\nJanggun-ui Adeul was renamed Street Hero and converted to a Game Gear cartridge for a US release by Innovation.

Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gjNpoV4B9E","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Eurocom","Publisher":"GameTek","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"32afd118-6447-49f7-b126-e4aeb51f7fe4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"c326fa1a-2ac2-44ff-ace4-5360fc75fb4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"f2f75090-d6ec-453f-afe7-a078bcec96a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"1c16796c-64ae-4168-83db-eb76e8924764.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"ac0aba3f-6021-48f4-a265-75540904af5b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"59ecca29-acc1-4b0b-b839-e02c6771cdfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":25324,"FileName":"e33577b4-8532-496e-841d-10260281ff22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":11828,"Name":"The Addams Family","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"THE ADDAMS FAMILY has been evicted!

The game though does take a different approach than games like Street Fighter, as you do not control the movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the amount of energy in a displayed \"move gauge\" which increases over the time. To perform a special attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates while it's not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their corresponding move.\n\nIn single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one' choice. However, not all fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords). Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and Sensui Shinobu.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Minato Giken","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"a6791ea9-3172-43c1-b63d-9a03e80a3128.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"cb2c6c0e-e0e0-4334-bbcc-5e81830b8817.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"ef35729a-07ba-4e1e-9ead-cdf8a5bb2288.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"48a48a67-a6c7-404f-b64d-436af3b16ff5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"c4ec2f91-d065-4927-b1e1-72cc8cf1e4a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"f39a6d8b-5042-48af-a978-9e6b137817e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20546,"FileName":"5fe4d0ad-c2d0-40d4-8a65-2269bc867f9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":20546,"AlternateName":"Yu Yu Hakusho 2: Gekitou!

If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Influence","Publisher":"Viacom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"3c11a8ca-d1d4-4c9a-8ffd-3b0203926e7b.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"acbcdbfa-1ed4-4990-8376-1e993df02761.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"c1db5c11-f8ed-470b-bc15-ebf7d6fb6cbe.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"4a81dffe-62a5-4fa2-8366-d4aa293f2ff2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"734c7585-d444-4786-ac16-2e7587320edb.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"79905c50-4977-42b1-a53d-1db94b70d318.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"f4fb7fc4-2553-4cfe-97e8-d9ed8cadc20d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14070,"FileName":"8e8723b7-2957-4e46-a313-eb6d4a6878b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196981,"Name":"Zoop'em Up ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/KtBI8mp6NVc","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Martin Konrad","Publisher":"SMS Power","ReleaseDate":"2002-03-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":196981,"FileName":"e11e98d0-b878-4817-b2c8-a2ec6ac58b78.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":196981,"FileName":"d936a667-1a8d-4d84-9df1-dea99953245d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196981,"FileName":"2883dd8c-ec72-413c-8ccd-df79639b4c8d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196981,"FileName":"c6c9a0ee-ae13-48d6-be61-9f98a19835a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":196981,"AlternateName":"Zoop'em Up by Martin Konrad","Region":"United States"}]}]}
