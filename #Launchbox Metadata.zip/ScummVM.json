The plot follows the adventure of Jason Roberts, whose brother was attacked during an expedition into the Amazon. Now Roberts starts his own expedition to help his brother and eventually race for a lost treasure.\n\nJason is moved with the keyboard, while actions are performed with a point & click interface, which means that the player combines a symbol from the command line or the inventory with another object or person in the game world. Most puzzles are inventory-based or multiple-choice dialogues, but there are also some action-based mini games, e.g. a canoe ride. Many puzzles require quick thinking (player character is killed if it takes the player too long to figure out the solution) and \"pixel hunting\" for small hot spots on the screen. During some sequences the player has to switch between Jason and the female lead character to progress.\n\nAn in-game hint system is available, but nevertheless it is possible to get stuck in a dead end, having missed an important item from a previous chapter.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Access Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Access Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"d3dc25ed-a3a9-4474-b35a-95d110988bdb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"a3649ead-dbd2-4994-8ea0-ee2453971836.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"9902413f-c29d-466a-a116-3410014a3826.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"86d84419-69b3-4ebe-8d1d-6f16b9214b2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"7c9fcef9-aa5a-4f2f-9b3e-0b1ca85f39d8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"fe47a366-108a-46bc-b2c2-4be975cb002f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"7cff072c-e08f-42be-9d5f-f8902426b50f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"f853c4f3-cb2d-4334-8f77-9d3a8fd7b21e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"8d4ca6c1-0d42-4aaa-bdd3-f3d4fd1c992a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"c9fc48ea-584f-455e-938d-38b18b09f429.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142965,"FileName":"fc41927a-5f87-4e78-bd6a-68d69b103573.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158447,"Name":"Backyard Baseball","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"In this first installment in the Backyard Sports series, the player's goal is to assemble a team of backyard kids and take them all the way to the championship - in this instance, the Ultra Grand Championship of the Universe.

Although several of the film's characters appear in the game, with the original actors returning to voice them, the film's protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film's soundtrack.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzSnSEmbyr8","Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Westwood Studios","Publisher":"Virgin Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1997-11-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"6cee19f1-3fd8-4d6f-9103-68e64da06584.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"98ad72ca-ef04-42e1-ad8a-f9cf58ad672a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"793b5209-fb1a-4a8e-a67a-5c4d9d0b3592.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"47be4bae-52bf-4307-bf38-c1c2abc24cc0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"99b00e11-cb2d-4a5a-ab29-2191fe8a546d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"74debc46-8c21-4de7-a1b1-840d648a70f8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"c9e052be-e2fe-417d-9396-b82f088c3d55.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"0b364af2-1405-4e44-abd1-cd86427233a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":169208,"FileName":"8a1e1d89-a2ea-40c1-933e-ecaa87b580c8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":142984,"Name":"Blue Force","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"You are Jake Ryan, rookie motorcycle cop.

Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict.\n\nCode-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra's other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command \"Look\" may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"120cb39e-d5f5-4c24-8a33-fc1399fbe5a3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"e64bdb6d-63d4-43dd-9440-ec7f69c812a2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"b5f23fb7-2f50-4695-b5ad-288026835e3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"17a0c52c-6957-4eef-b51c-f9d775a73ce4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"60d8aaaf-859f-4678-8252-ceaf65a83fab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"1ed8ed1f-3c57-405b-b672-dc2aa842e776.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"02b2a1c2-6359-4175-ac7e-3e5217c4e3b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"d0839381-7c47-4ad5-ba5b-076f9cbbf45d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142995,"FileName":"10960801-79ad-41e8-aa16-3017c8ee9759.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":142996,"Name":"Conquests of Camelot: The Search for the Grail","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land.\n\nConquests of Camelot is an adventure game that requires the player to input text commands, mostly by combining verbs and objects (such as \"look man\", \"take purse\", etc.). A few commands (such as \"ask about\") have keyboard shortcuts. Unlike most other adventures, the game does not focus extensively on inventory-based puzzles. Rather, it presents a diverse array of tasks depending on concrete situations. These involve exploration, solving riddles, gathering information, participating in arcade sequences such as jousting, and others. Rudimentary money management is present as well.\n\nMany problems have different solutions, and it is possible to reach the final part of the game even without having completed some of the essential quests (e.g. failing to save the knights). However, Arthur is being judged by the game in three different categories: skill (referring to the action sequences), wisdom (evaluating the amount of cultural information gathered), and soul (determining the moral value of Arthur's action). Failure to achieve a high score in the last category leads to a bad ending.\n\nThe game is set in a concrete historical period, but adds an alternate reality to it, assuming that pagan deities really existed, but were overshadowed by Christian worship. However, there are only a few references to real religious practices of the time or any historical characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"166b2868-4a8c-4a5a-ba26-874bd8d3dd3e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"c9777389-56c9-4e9e-990a-5a499a3091f1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"1efc8aa5-4ef8-410c-ac96-126abf4a3c89.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"878dbdcf-ec41-494a-a981-baed409a4572.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"14b50b92-6c81-43fe-82ee-0aebffc8a4bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"43b7e013-80fe-419b-acf1-7f7722215d3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"acd7df53-b54b-487a-b001-78a557030218.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"c3908b9d-8f86-4460-9e7d-3a2639e921f4.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"f1df6030-991f-487f-b5fe-dd2eb1ed591b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"84456616-d4f1-42b0-8f4f-5b6b58760742.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"5276a81c-c770-46c2-9f91-309c4ef309ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"2d4cd09f-5dd3-44bb-af3e-1ea5d4a1a9f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":142996,"FileName":"8ebc16b9-c081-413a-bba6-199ccd1fc031.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":142996,"AlternateName":"Conquests of Camelot: King Arthur, Quest for the Grail","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":142998,"Name":"Conquests of the Longbow: The Legend of Robin Hood","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"The year is 1193, and the Third Crusade has just ended. Richard the Lionheart, King of England, returns to Europe from the Holy Land. On the way, he is ambushed and abducted by the soldiers of the Austrian duke Leopold. The duke demands a large ransom to be paid in exchange for the king's freedom. However, the king's brother, Prince John, is content with the situation and plotting to take the throne for himself. That is when the legendary Robin Hood, one who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, decides to raise the money needed to liberate the king, with the help of his fellow outlaws of Sherwood Forest.\n\nConquests of the Longbow is an adventure game and a follow-up to Conquests of Camelot. It uses an icon-based interface common to most contemporary Sierra adventures. Like its spiritual predecessor, it differs from most other games in the genre by reducing traditional inventory-based puzzles in favor of exploration and varied tasks dictated by the situation at hand. These include talking to characters, gathering information, making decisions, solving riddles, or participating in mini-games such as combat, archery contest, and Nine Men's Morris (with adjustable difficulty).\n\nThe game is divided into days; each day is completed when certain tasks have been fulfilled. It is, however, possible to fail some of those tasks and still advance the plot. Several situations can be handled in different ways. The player's decisions affect Robin Hood's ranking towards the end of the game. Number of points scored, the amount of money collected for the ransom, and the fate of Robin's fellow outlaws are considered when awarding the rank. Depending on these factors the player reaches one of the four possible endings, ranging from Robin getting hanged to a happy conclusion of his love life.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"3032856d-2fb2-4fb0-9edb-ef4a9ad16fbc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"8339015f-99ef-4b7e-8c37-9bcd7902fc48.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"69292ec9-49df-47fb-8634-6eef924e9099.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"fc527327-31d4-4eaf-b650-af6900d3961d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"824cfbd6-d539-4a9f-80ba-75b1b8e31279.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"d1194b6a-0a36-4ece-b420-c4865245defc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"d3672173-505e-47bc-b766-01514b596ddf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"07841a11-b1e9-4b4d-aeae-38e74b42e585.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":142998,"FileName":"8db67d23-7a53-4280-b423-0b23a5da50eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":142998,"AlternateName":"Conquests of the Longbow: The Adventures of Robin Hood","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":136005,"Name":"Crazy Nick's Software Picks: King Graham's Board Game Challenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A board game challenge featuring two board games: Checkers and Backgammon.

The game was released on April 20, 1995 for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. It was Schafer's first game as project lead and head writer and designer, after having worked on other LucasArts titles including The Secret of Monkey Island (1990), Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991), and Day of the Tentacle (1993). Set in the near future, the game's story follows Ben, the leader of a biker gang, who is framed for the murder of a beloved motorcycle manufacturing mogul and seeks to clear his and his gang's names. A remastered version of the game was developed by Double Fine Productions and was released in April 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.\n\nFull Throttle was LucasArts' eleventh adventure game overall and the tenth to use the company's in-house game engine, SCUMM. It featured full motion video and action sequences, using LucasArts' INSANE animation engine, which was previously utilized in Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire. It was the first LucasArts game to be released for Microsoft Windows and the first to be distributed only on CD-ROM. It also introduced a contextual pie menu through which the player controls interactions with objects and characters. In contrast to other computer games of the era, which mostly relied on in-house talent for their voice acting, Full Throttle used mostly professional voice actors, including Roy Conrad as Ben, Mark Hamill as the villainous Adrian Ripburger, Hamilton Camp as the elderly Malcolm Corley, and Kath Soucie as Ben's ally Maureen. It was one of the few LucasArts games to use licensed music, featuring songs by San Francisco-area rock band The Gone Jackals.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"LucasArts","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"6b286d53-fbc9-4543-b697-9230219d96d1.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"621a985c-dd15-4986-9aa4-84d5eeeb2fb8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"96985f11-088d-45d9-866a-344791666e1a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"56aac5f3-65c5-4755-bd1c-46c23a1e7792.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"ffdf7093-c34d-4334-8090-fb1de3aaa89c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"5e84eed0-bd9c-44fc-b5ec-080e9265adba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"459e5456-f8ba-41cc-9f94-6e1f1d2c6810.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"15b90ec4-5bd6-430e-85c0-be9eb4e65922.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"4690a9cc-be2e-4fe6-8c99-02e2b4f58070.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"66729376-905d-4cfe-8dbf-b3acd6e40891.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"13408aed-2d98-42ed-b304-1dedc0e97c01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"01c43da5-1063-49c2-b6df-86f67e409d5a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"cc8e47b8-560b-496b-96ba-2e743716f1bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"0b650cd1-e442-4fa3-a00f-be1335171c0d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"d08709a1-8e52-47c6-9c44-e498dc909479.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"2a1b37a4-54aa-48bd-8a7b-913447500731.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"8044a701-e544-4644-9e94-32ed359a5c42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"1074fdca-3143-470f-8f5e-57f1b216e39f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"a000e14c-3c4a-47ab-9c53-bdc9b2f18903.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143030,"FileName":"2879f1e8-0417-4d2a-b068-661650d0bc01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143031,"Name":"Future Wars: Adventures in Time","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"In the year 1989, a simple window cleaner is working outside of a skyscraper. Intending to play a prank on his angry boss, the unlikely hero discovers a secret passage leading to a time machine along with mysterious alien documents. Operating the device transports the protagonist to the year 1304, where he is given a seemingly ordinary task of rescuing a lady in danger. However, he soon finds out about a much more serious threat of a global alien invasion. The hero has to travel to the remote future of the 44th century and eventually to the even more remote past of the Cretaceous period to foil their plans.\n\nFuture Wars is a graphic adventure game, and the first to use Delphine's proprietary Cinematique point-and-click interface. A right click brings up the verb menu. After choosing one of the six commands, the player points the mouse over the desired target and executes the action with a left click. Small objects are depicted by enlarged drawings once they have been discovered; however, many of them are well-hidden and often require precise positioning on the part of the player character to discover. The game has a linear story advancement, and it is possible to die or become irrevocably stuck by failing to locate a crucial item in one of the previous locations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Delphine Software","Publisher":"Interplay","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"228c1af0-720f-4c9f-ab23-9b48ca442291.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"930a455b-7c34-462c-b008-c06dc9e63a12.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"e7b78cbc-4118-4a54-976c-1ac6f33ebf5d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"b515e3e9-1e1e-4678-b0d9-e63c90b83772.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"f65dbbc3-fb31-40ea-a1e8-325ab5d1c0ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"0f9669a8-3686-4a63-9660-d6fe72007299.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"1b971cad-1b22-43f1-863b-eb439fcca98b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"b4fcbc1f-b1cd-4664-a3f4-0e52ca49c7b1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143031,"FileName":"7e2b2497-d755-43f3-bb99-b0df3b83449b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143033,"Name":"Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"He started out writing a book on voodoo, now he's fighting for his very soul.\n\nGabriel Knight is the last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight the dark forces of the supernatural.

The great archaeologist and adventurer has to solve a grand mystery once again, aided by his trusty whip, his sharp wit, and his courage. A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A young woman who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on a grand journey across the globe.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a puzzle-solving adventure game conceived in the spirit of Indiana Jones movies; however, it is not based on a specific movie, introducing a new, independent story. The game utilizes LucasArts' SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a few simple hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis, some of which can be avoided.\n\nThe middle part of the game can be played in three \"modes\": co-operation (Indy and Sophia), adventure (Indy alone), and action (Indy alone, with less puzzles and more action). In each mode there are different locations to visit, different puzzles to solve, and different characters to meet. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to all the conversations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"7aea3622-f20f-4385-918b-53236bf3eca3.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"63779b0e-a5af-4c8d-8b29-202514778e23.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"61ccd5d5-7d30-4de1-8515-00f54d2418df.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"6a0aef15-900e-42a0-a66b-a91e4df524ea.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"033f8e8b-0455-4a87-8e2e-0297cab83004.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"f70de6fe-19e1-4165-9579-53e31859045d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"8498883a-d424-49ab-81ff-2b043e49c3f9.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"a1455497-f4ff-4c6f-bc8c-4678c630801f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"c694bea1-317b-4e35-b5c9-0e09f6fdfefd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"4d4b7284-927a-4dbd-8229-63b7cccf9c26.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"07ecb73f-6c60-4311-86ba-d176b66fe1b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"fcf3564f-4838-4a2a-9ae6-d02d2a118788.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"972ad89a-efa6-4530-9f18-c4e798fb7a92.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"21a910ea-5648-45fa-9e96-35c5a3b41482.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"f2c8bacb-7da9-4ebb-9f83-899c80327692.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"bc862b73-d6c7-4d78-a2be-0090e2a20e87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"b2073faf-ad9d-43b3-85a3-e550b6eeffd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"0de60ed9-9b83-4826-af6e-96b1f6410ec6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"8c6c6b2a-0712-4f26-a9ee-412d2b4d5de6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"292c9cf3-139a-4bd4-a887-804a4b1b58d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143050,"FileName":"9f5c3ec8-5233-48ff-829c-3cf690a2dfdc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143049,"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It is 1938 and adventurer Indiana Jones is joined by his father on this quest, preventing Adolf Hitler from capturing the Holy Grail.

As opposed to earlier graphic adventures, the player is able to navigate the protagonist on screen in eight directions, creating an effect of three-dimensional exploration. The player character can also be obscured from view when hiding behind an object, is subjected to gravity, and has different animations for actions such as picking up an item, falling, swimming, etc. Graham can be moved around with arrow keys and perform various actions when the player types commands, normally consisting of noun and verb combinations (e.g. \"Take flower\", \"Talk man\", etc.).\n\nThe game world consists of a cyclic outdoor area with places of interest (houses, characters, etc.) that must be found through exploration. Much of the kingdom is accessible to Graham from the beginning, and there are only a few restrictions imposed on traveling. In order to complete the game, the player has to procure certain items and use them in correct situations or with specific characters. Some of the puzzles rely on fairy tales, and a good knowledge of those makes them easier to solve.\n\nThe game awards the player points for most of the actions he makes Graham perform. Since some of those are not crucial to completion, it is quite possible to finish the game without having attained the full score. Some of the tasks in the game have multiple solutions, though the game may grant the player less points if he chooses the simpler one. Many hazards await Graham on his journey, and death is frequent if the player is not careful. The game can also be rendered unwinnable by failing to collect a specific item or wasting it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"2df856f4-8d57-4198-9250-1d441056f143.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"55f1ab21-1fd7-4a06-813c-c5d8a4aa01e6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"61701fa6-684a-49e6-9af8-3c49fd89c9a3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"9ba899c8-0b0c-4c9a-88a6-6523c8741a95.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"cf475c1c-33d4-4b4e-ad72-99773976a601.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"45442a9b-0753-4c20-a0c7-4e0c0610f535.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"384395e5-b5c0-43aa-b873-cfd0bc4d2fad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"d3c2a7aa-f129-46fa-ae2e-1b74318a48c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"cad82def-f041-4230-acb4-d5201a6c7746.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"2f7a125c-c641-4dd1-aad1-2a8aac28f66c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"e5521f0a-88a4-4c2d-8cd9-3747e5838a1d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"2b4bae61-f264-4ea4-8a88-6bd5302482a7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"d8f4ec79-92d6-4b5a-8698-bbfccd2c4049.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"fd7169ab-9b84-4c2f-bd85-7ade1aee54b4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"6d1cb999-641b-4f72-8628-c599f97783fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143060,"FileName":"a926925e-78a0-4902-882d-00967a560cae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143060,"AlternateName":"Kings Quest: Quest for the Crown","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":158409,"Name":"King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Roberta Williams' King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown is a remake of King's Quest.

It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.\n\nMeanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.\n\nKing's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas.\n\nThere are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions.

Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte.\n\nKing's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is similar to the first two installments of the series, with a large interconnected world open for exploration and no time limit imposed. The game is the first in the series to have a day and night cycle; certain actions can be performed only during a specific time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1988-08-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"dd8cca54-f741-4083-b9cd-2d89ea3d0e5f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"b3f5e795-5ef0-48cf-b542-ce6841574ad3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"4b34b28a-ed22-4164-a511-6094112a00d4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"0d076956-28e0-4c56-928e-55d2ab33bc00.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"d229d6cb-7e2f-441c-8576-bd8a2bd59112.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"b17bfb81-1385-4452-a76d-6d149bfecdce.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"363bc475-6115-4b52-a99e-1a8646f5be36.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"856665ec-8ae1-408f-95f5-b21f8692a423.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"f93b4a7e-fab9-47ab-a675-b4bb785b03fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"576f24c7-2050-4635-b762-18c6912fe431.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"ca983e9b-bea7-4702-92dc-5209dcec5a80.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143067,"FileName":"6d0edb1d-eb4d-42a1-bb62-039569ab08cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143067,"AlternateName":"King's Quest 4 - The Perils of Rosella","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143061,"Name":"King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.\n\nAs with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-09T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"e675e52a-2faa-4335-93b7-bb5a9811a58c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"d252d843-0b9f-4143-aeb0-ca1e4dc45141.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"77e4dfaa-8a96-479e-8292-aec3a87a5efa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"6ee911b0-24da-4a2c-a96a-0c4882be2108.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"79f9103d-89ec-4d76-8a88-82d5cf09ea6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"f2afec66-23ee-4f53-94ec-4423c34242a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"22bd3ace-92ef-4d97-a119-5f23e46c2c79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"fa7f3c12-8863-4fb4-8ca1-9b400fd0d553.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"505f609e-ca60-4ee4-a994-40bbfbab90ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"7797fda2-fc84-4de5-879f-c301392102d7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"4dca07ce-0c85-4841-93b2-e08683d13e69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"cbf945b7-efbf-4d46-a9ab-0f221c0ca66b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"042b9091-17b2-427c-8e95-2bd2ead1ff74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143061,"FileName":"5a97b885-c558-4585-af91-bd9efac66206.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143061,"AlternateName":"King's Quest 5 - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143062,"Name":"King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.\n\nLike its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs (\"walk\", \"examine\", \"use\", \"talk\", etc.).\n\nThe CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a pre-rendered introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJzHHUOfYjc","Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"60a9d1ed-f2d1-4c0c-ac8c-b94b35bedd65.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"8918a13b-6a2c-4d03-a04b-ba8573e2d928.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"a565416d-f471-4463-b67f-c28522d7ba93.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"f2234721-b351-4639-9e3b-92468fc99ba8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"99f0374a-3d84-4c91-9627-e89d3ac9eb32.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"f1b3ff8b-eb63-4825-b8c8-5178b4adf841.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"84bb9fae-1d3f-4549-9957-7512f1613796.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"7812d747-817c-4f53-8e31-fb9690d1dd6f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"a86ea556-33ec-4109-a63c-1494caea999c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"0c5d8bc7-524e-4bd9-9b86-4c10e30fb034.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"99d63fcf-d523-425e-a0b9-344a250b9345.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"b75c8018-263b-4b56-8b64-685ccf9be34b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"64b68dc9-a5b0-4cb9-8d7c-f8a02a71b805.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"1c289c9c-fe36-4d72-9306-acb4d6f520f5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143062,"FileName":"1d950e51-00bf-4ef4-9b92-8f5012eff0e0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143062,"AlternateName":"King's Quest 6 - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143063,"Name":"King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Queen Valanice of Daventry has always thought that getting married would be the best course of action for her daughter Rosella.

The game is divided into chapters, alternating between the queen and the princess as protagonists. As opposed to the realistic drawing style of all the preceding game, it has brightly colored visuals reminiscent of Walt Disney cartoons.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"5c1395d7-c7aa-4fa1-b069-520c3681a997.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"3b907c2b-c5a5-45ae-81f2-c563ffa3ed48.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"61ca739b-a0c1-449b-a6ac-74aead87364e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"10f7fea8-a905-4ace-982e-d27e4077cfce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"436a5418-ece1-4dba-b3b0-3d142b607226.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"3b6b32c7-e1e7-47bd-adfe-1bf6f65ba0df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"36838145-35bc-44d3-91b8-c1636364f996.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"d4e17203-a2dc-4862-b663-fddc7f82f823.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"33290dd2-57fd-4e97-a738-bdf0e8cf31e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"fdf01028-7791-47a6-a57f-a8398eddb8c0.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"8978ee40-ef6f-4d57-90a5-e5249f6e2384.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"00041723-f85b-446f-a41c-50393078011c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"c93174ff-ec51-4678-ba79-5296db247ef1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"47697411-a552-475d-9756-431e869fb737.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"41629363-9b74-461c-a927-0161ceb5a650.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143063,"FileName":"c21dbf1f-cd63-4d03-9014-37d0abd36018.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143063,"AlternateName":"King's Quest 7 - The Princeless Bride","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":174428,"Name":"Książę i Tchórz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Książę i Tchórz (The Prince and the Coward) is a 2D point and click adventure.

Laura Bow is a young student attending the Tulane University in New Orleans, and an aspiring journalist. Her friend Lillian invites her to spend a weekend in a mansion belonging to her uncle, Colonel Henri Dijon, a veteran of Spanish-American war and the owner of a large, but decaying sugar plantation on a secluded island. During the dinner Laura meets members of Lillian's extended family and their alleged friends. As Laura begins to explore the mansion and talk to its inhabitants, she unravels old family feuds and realizes some of those people - if not all - have their own plans and schemes. It all gets much worse when strange accidents and murders start to occur. Laura must investigate those gruesome events and find the culprit.\n\nThe Colonel's Bequest is a detective mystery adventure game very similar in style and presentation to Agatha Christie's novels. The game world is confined to the island and consists of numerous interconnected areas, such as various rooms in the mansion, garden, smaller structures, etc. The player is free to explore much of the game's world right from the beginning, with only a few areas being initially inaccessible. The game's clock advances a quarter of an hour each time Laura performs an action pertaining to the plot. Characters have their own schedules and clues are often obtained by discretely observing their actions.\n\nThe player interacts with the environment by typing verb-object command combinations (such as \"Look Garden\", \"Talk Colonel\", etc.). Some of the most common actions have keyboard shortcuts. The gameplay largely focuses on exploration. Much of the plot stays in the background and can be uncovered by talking to the characters about various topics (mostly other people). There is an inventory and a few puzzles, but they play a much less prominent role in the game compared to other adventures by Sierra. It is possible to complete the game without having discovered the entire plot or even without having identified the murderer. There is no scoring system, but after the game is finished the player is given a detective ranking and told about story branches or other elements he might have missed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"b9010800-89c9-4da3-980e-0459196aeffc.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"fc14315a-6cd8-423e-966b-255d6e16fe84.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"13c11232-5dc8-4ccb-9c8d-0d252531fec4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"4e4d9f0b-3f4b-4bec-bbc2-aaafa2a7f51b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"93021613-e95d-4593-b7be-c653cebf690f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"376ea818-eccf-44a3-87ce-ed170eb1c480.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"aa5ca96a-61c2-46fc-b86c-8fd30b2cf8a2.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"9e81623f-737f-4351-ae78-b5e5fcdeadea.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"ec841d2d-dc7a-44b0-9633-8e4e716a9ebb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14201,"FileName":"7783bc3f-f523-4589-bf5e-6166e82826fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":14201,"AlternateName":"The Colonel's Bequest","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":14201,"AlternateName":"Laura Bow 1: The Colonels Bequest","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":14202,"Name":"Laura Bow: The Dagger of Amon Ra","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"One year after the events described in The Colonel's Bequest, Laura Bow, fresh out of college, is hired by a New York newspaper to write a story about the newest exhibit acquired by the local Leyendecker Museum, an ancient Egyptian dagger. However, during a party to celebrate the opening of the museum's new section, someone is murdered, the dagger is stolen, and Laura, after asking to be allowed to investigate, is locked in with the rest of the guests. This sets the stage for a series of murders, and it is up to Laura to find the person responsible for them.\n\nThe Dagger of Amon Ra plays similarly to the The Colonel's Bequest, focusing primarily on exploration and clue-gathering rather than on solving puzzles, although there are more instances of inventory item collection and usage in the sequel. With the exception of the introductory act, the entire game is set in the museum. The player navigates Laura through its rooms and interacts with characters to gather information and uncover their true motives. The game's clock advances when it is triggered by certain actions or simply by moving from location to location. Some information and events may only be available in specific places and at specific times. Near the end of the game Laura will be asked to make a case to to the coroner, which involves answering a series of questions concerning the crimes. Depending on his playing style, clues discovered, and deductive skills, the player may or may not have the correct answers to all the questions.\n\nUnlike its predecessor - and like most other contemporary Sierra adventures - the game utilizes an icon-based interface instead of typing verb-object commands to interact with the environments. Topics can also be chosen from a list when the player selects the \"Ask\" command. The CD version features full speech, including narration.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"02262bbe-a861-4157-8aa1-114937b9a3d4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"8cc69c02-e4a9-4629-a979-d89029c88bbe.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"740b71f7-a8ca-4231-91be-6a1d41e0a844.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"8ff06c64-dc86-46f6-811d-44b720dacee2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"d352b1d5-b9df-4bd3-a993-9f6b12b12d39.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"680c3d76-9b71-4b6e-b065-da3ec5560935.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"15629c3f-b4e8-4f70-ad3e-9c292f2589e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14202,"FileName":"61b9163d-3288-4092-a348-989e1771263f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":14202,"AlternateName":"Laura Bow 2: The Dagger of Amon-Ra","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143066,"Name":"Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2: Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X!","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Almost twenty years passed since the inhabitants of Earth defeated the Leather Goddesses of Phobos.

He wins a weekend at the Spa Resort, La Costa Lotta. Naturally, there are some beautiful women in the spa who are just dreaming about such a wonderful, handsome man as Larry!

Communities and states comprised of people united by a common trade were created. The Guild of Weavers has achieved such mastery in their trade that they discovered the secret of weaving the very fabric of reality. They were treated with suspicion by other guilds, who eventually accused them of practicing witchcraft and banned them to a secluded island, which they called Loom.\n\nBobbin Threadbare is a young man from the Guild of Weavers. He is outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times, though he does not know why. On his seventeenth birthday he is summoned by the Elders of the guild, who intend to decide his fate. However, shortly thereafter all the inhabitants of the village except Bobbin are turned into swans. Bobbin finds out that he is the child of the Great Loom, found by Lady Cygna, who tried to use the loom's powers to save the guild. Bobbin's stepmother Dame Hetchel teaches him the art of weaving magical drafts, and Bobbin embarks on a journey to find the lost flock, and the answers to his questions.\n\nLoom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called \"drafts\" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.\n\nEach draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be \"reversed\", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.\n\nThe game features three difficulty levels, differentiating them by changing the way the interface works. The easiest level displays names of the notes as well as marking the correspondent areas on the distaff; Standard level features the distaff with the marks at the bottom of the screen, but no written notes; whereas Expert does not display the marks at all, requiring the player to memorize and play the drafts by ear.\n\nThe CD DOS version of the game has enhanced 256-color graphics, audio tracks, and full voice acting. However, it also removes a few close-up scenes and conversations. The FM Towns version preserves these scenes and includes similar graphical and musical enhancements, but has no voice acting.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"e6b16be0-ee1e-4e7a-9ca6-fa58137e9b29.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"10db40dc-f9e8-449d-a292-22b3ad882bdc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"50bf6132-b6c5-4daa-95fd-3b6a57bdfc55.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"d0a6a511-fe8c-4348-80bc-634187b2f479.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"c5280a8c-1e50-448f-ab07-69ed12f1de6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"36b8e0bb-b318-4157-8ebe-9045f527c1e8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"0adf59a0-c8e5-4a16-82a6-1e8d431ec04a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"b7d549f7-85fa-4207-9efc-f723bb2fc0cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"814c8089-d3b5-4427-9c54-a22e5569952b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"88968f24-5fc2-447d-922f-032b81aae8d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151338,"FileName":"6116f6f7-4087-4d9e-abfb-d22a98cb6741.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143130,"Name":"Lost in Time","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"He Plotted Your Doom Centuries Before You Were Born.\n\nNow you must race across time to outwit a murderous fiend, exploring hostile jungles, luxurious chateaus, and a past fraught with danger.

Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.\n\nPlayers start by choosing two students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as \"OPEN Door\"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":173048,"FileName":"09615866-4377-4504-aa02-c3477b627f19.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":173048,"FileName":"83e7b6fe-3bea-4a60-9e88-793e173c3ad9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":173048,"FileName":"5ff20c86-4a8c-4a87-aa63-ee3c0f9ec610.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137569,"Name":"Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Purple Tentacle, one of the crazy Dr. Fred's creations, drinks contaminated water from Dr. Fred's Sludge-o-matic.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use.\n\nHero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories.\n\nThe main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics.\n\nThe game features a day/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1989-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"0ad8f015-3d19-4d3e-8372-78b4858267e1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"9f919d59-fb25-443b-a332-e241c22c051e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"af624395-d55c-4dea-a122-23b03d7e673a.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"af583f65-792e-43e3-98c9-89b85701de56.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"c15bb05f-c75a-4393-82e1-4f2fcc80c119.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"64a23e2e-06ac-441e-afe0-9b28091fd5e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"61725ea8-8832-4232-9fb1-a1f95f6308f3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"4a26ebbc-8f15-4187-bb7d-cee16a87aa71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"ba68136f-a410-459e-bcd1-df4598ff9512.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143038,"FileName":"5066ac7c-4f44-4a30-93b8-fb26e0759c11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143038,"AlternateName":"Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143222,"Name":"Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero (VGA Remake)","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero is a remake of Heros Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero.\n\nThe remake features 256-color VGA graphics. Locations have been re-drawn, and character portraits appear during conversations. This version also has an icon-based interface instead of the text input of the original, very similar to the one used by Sierra for their adventure titles. The player selects dialogue choices from a dialogue menu, as opposed to typing in conversation topics in the earlier release. A few changes have been made to the dialogue, adding (or altering) some of the easter eggs and references to other games.\n\nCombat now features clay models for the enemies and stop-motion animation. The perspective has been switched to an over-the-shoulder view farther away from the player. Battle commands (two types of attacks, parry, and dodge) are displayed as icons on a shield in the corner of the screen. The player can switch to the spell menu at any time, and also click the middle of the screen to escape from combat.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"2194f656-1f02-48fa-9d04-03c053a22b43.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"5ab3f9fb-b24b-45cc-80c2-53bffcb21671.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"08f2ab4a-4cd8-4aa1-8402-fd6207dc2c63.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"c7072a9c-7dac-4a7d-9652-3ea2525e4d2a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"a91f59a9-d9cc-4de2-a1ce-247563859cfd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"c884d5fe-1bbc-449f-80fe-3033fed02671.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"4fdece92-e87d-4e0f-8b62-1c2d725dc156.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"be122794-c8f0-41ed-9841-9ca64a83ab19.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"899892c3-62bf-457d-b472-b38ea3203620.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"f2546bba-ad53-49b7-9943-b7d105529179.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143222,"FileName":"72e21859-af8d-4f2f-9aeb-49382c11bf89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143222,"AlternateName":"Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":149409,"Name":"Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Trial by Fire is the sequel to Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero. It takes place in the town Shapeir and the desert surrounding it, in a Middle East-like environment. It seems that the powerful elemental spirits have been troubling the Shapeir folk recently. Something, or someone, is behind those troubles. It is the hero's task to find out what is going on, get acquainted with the many inhabitants of Shapeir, and prove once more that he is worthy of his heroic title.\n\nLike its predecessor, Trial by Fire is a hybrid game that incorporates elements from adventure and role-playing genres. It has a text-based interface, puzzles to solve, inventory items, characters to talk to, as well as pure RPG elements such as character growth system and battles. Player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a wizard, and can also become a paladin during the course of the game if he follows a strict moral code.\n\nReal-time combat is presented on separate screens and offers more options than the previous title. There are several types of high, mid-level, and low attacks, as well as parrying and dodging. The hero raises his combat proficiency and other skills by fighting enemies, training, and performing various actions that influence the corresponding parameters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"fd8f5685-d6a0-4fec-a6a1-cfc12152a296.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"d8e68848-62e8-4665-8b47-20d87dbc9bce.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"0277f9a8-808c-4dd5-b9bd-0fef6d14e2f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"bf2cd731-0ebe-431e-b64c-c111c095c142.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"04e35e36-278f-4630-a288-0a07206e28d1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"71c6600c-459f-4621-b29f-d5e253651c38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":149409,"FileName":"b328677d-4af2-416b-83a9-d925734cb378.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":149409,"AlternateName":"Quest for Glory 2: Trial by Fire","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143223,"Name":"Quest for Glory III: Wages of War","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wages of War is the third game in the Quest for Glory series. It is set in the Africa-like world of Tarna, where the hero travels with paladin Rakeesh, his new Liontaur friend he has met in the previous game. Shortly after his arrival, the hero learns about the conflict between the human Simbani tribe and the seemingly malevolent neighboring Leopardmen. It is now time for our hero to become a skillful diplomat and prevent an upcoming war between the two nations.\n\nThe basic gameplay system is similar to that of the two preceding games. The game has an adventure-like structure and gameplay elements, including puzzles to solve, inventory items to use, and characters to talk to, as well as a role-playing system with combat and character development. As in the predecessors, the player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a mage; in this installment, the paladin class is selectable from the beginning of the game (unlike the previous game, where the hero could only earn the title of a paladin during the course of the story). Saved characters from the previous game can be imported.\n\nLike in the earlier Quest for Glory games, the main character's parameters increase directly after battles or by repeatedly performing various actions. New to the series is an overworld map on which the hero travels between locations. Hostile encounters may occur randomly while traversing the map. Combat system is similar to the predecessors, with real-time battles where the player selects various offensive and defensive options.\n\nGraphics engine and interface in this installment are the same as in the remake of the first game: it has 256-color graphics and an icon-based interface which was used by Sierra for their contemporary adventure games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1992-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"78d8c7ae-8454-49ed-ae15-c772a901f0de.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"ab1c4325-8407-4249-81b3-bbd3af969bb8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"a26bab54-f4fb-412f-b865-1a099aa1f8f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"e5ab0155-abbe-460d-be83-3b7cb7cfdf4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"4a2146f5-2135-4acd-b092-0068e6016400.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"e1f776d0-a6f4-4bbb-9272-a467926022df.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"c3fd2bde-1d06-4b1f-b52e-3c5f9b2c59bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"4a8c317e-867f-4ef8-a519-e93bf2a9433b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"9fafae33-0430-48e5-a262-e65c5f192426.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"2742b21f-4e57-41bd-ac3a-0b144f640188.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"ede82927-0229-4527-975e-94b59644bd4c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143223,"FileName":"9850f8b6-d829-4d3f-9da2-d96a1234a78b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143223,"AlternateName":"Quest for Glory 3 - Wages of War","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143224,"Name":"Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shadows of Darkness is the fourth Quest for Glory game. It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.\n\nLike the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).\n\nCombat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1993-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"557db079-2330-4e4d-9527-10bdfb094bfb.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"63820e50-e9e9-434a-9271-335d8fcf2584.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"a2753231-d9bd-4286-a07c-9c37a06340a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"ed70ff91-555d-46da-8e7d-4176084610e5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"84d9c54f-854b-4caf-8657-c4b69eda09a2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"b6caac47-9e6b-40b7-8eaf-9665f4d1ae55.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"feea266e-c0f7-435f-9491-50a54f78adf1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"ba789753-111e-4f36-afd2-4e9dd9a283d4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"d8adbeb5-8ba7-4544-8a90-7d3bb5e42d1b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"860bb386-9aa5-4d78-a299-5ccdbdedbaa3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143224,"FileName":"066a8228-b171-4152-a726-5c9f6b7904f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143224,"AlternateName":"Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143224,"AlternateName":"Quest for Glory 4 - Shadows of Darkness","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143213,"Name":"Rama","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An immense alien craft, from the distant depths of space, has suddenly and unexpectedly entered our solar system.

Like its predecessor, Riven is heavy on puzzles, which rarely include using inventory items, but usually involve understanding and manipulating the complex environments and machinery of the game world.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cyan","Publisher":"Red Orb Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"77135fee-31fb-4d25-9b1b-a5b25048df66.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"7f508e5b-3212-40ce-b764-9adc211e768b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"7853abdb-867d-4050-b1ae-a5ed232f8df4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"263ec2ae-3f4c-4a0a-8722-02ca536d190e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"c5df6de4-9826-45b5-a906-819e1c7d0880.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"e563ab43-7b64-455d-a180-3da7fca01871.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"0d8bced4-a306-4fef-ad6b-522704280c53.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"bfca14a4-6d5e-4d7f-86eb-97a5df67386d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"b0672c9f-233f-4d4e-bec1-1bf70ff742dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"cf0fa95d-38db-4c4a-ac9c-951808b8df44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143173,"FileName":"c0c0b801-aa4c-44d3-a595-3b544a4a2c38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158394,"Name":"Roberta Williams' Mixed-Up Mother Goose","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"This is a totally rewritten version of the original Mixed Up Mother Goose, featuring enhanced MIDI soundtrack, VGA graphics, complete digitized speech along with improved animations and a few other goodies.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158394,"FileName":"b0888986-ae3f-4d4c-ab42-be2c07e43fcb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158394,"FileName":"00efe820-940c-4fac-b073-9419de1f59f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":158394,"FileName":"02b58a0b-7593-4c6f-a19b-10c6900ff104.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":158394,"FileName":"caa552fd-4550-4e45-aaef-75aa84cea798.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158394,"FileName":"5a7609e5-8142-4c1f-b143-0bbaf169ef12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158394,"FileName":"e07b404f-3bfd-43d9-b994-5965bd8695a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143240,"Name":"Rodneys Funscreen","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Rodney's Funscreen is an early children's game designed by Rodney Greenblat, later responsible for the art in the Parappa the Rapper series.

Upon the completion of a rescue mission from the clutches of a mad scientist, the duo drives through the opening credits and immediately receives a new assignment: Bruno the Bigfoot is missing from the circus and seems to have kidnapped Trixie, the Giraffe-Neck Girl. Sam and Max are on the case and will follow the mystery all across the United States, even if it takes them to such locations as The World's Largest Ball of Twine and The Mount Rushmore Dinosaur Tarpit.\n\nSam & Max Hit the Road is a puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure game. The player directly controls Sam, though Max will usually follow closely behind and is even available to use directly as an item in the inventory. Sam is able to be directed anywhere on the screen, look at objects, try to use objects, try to speak to objects and use items from his inventory on objects. Sam and Max must unravel the mystery piece by piece in order to unlock new locations on their map. They can travel between these locations at any time by using the car keys on their police car.\n\nDuring conversation, the player is able to make Sam ask questions of persons, speak non-sequitur exclamations, or ask about specific objects, people, and locations (which are also unlocked as clues are discovered). The verb interface from previous LucasArts adventure games has been modified to icon-based commands, allowing the entire screen to be used for the playing area, similarly to Sierra titles.\n\nThe game also features a variety of mini-games, which can be accessed at any time once found. These include Highway-Surfing: a game where the player must jump over exit signs on the interstate, Car Bomb: a variant of Battleship, a Sam & Max coloring book, a Sam & Max dress-up game, and a Whac-a-Mole variant entitled Wak-A-Rat. The CD version of the game includes voice-overs for all the conversations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"LucasArts","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"9b468e11-c1bc-472e-bac2-26103eecef6b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"0edebace-c515-43e3-bb27-bb0f0adcad04.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"a7727074-68ea-4ac0-93ef-0f15bbe6c5cf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"c35ed1e6-0660-4a9c-8595-a0ab152b5283.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"b0072f95-7d29-4941-a61d-4057651c40de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"122f4194-cd97-4e25-bbd5-892919b0eec0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"47f135ba-1a94-4fa2-86a7-b836cc698825.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"46b0b4ff-1fc6-4f57-8ea5-9b8e3e85ad2c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"0ff84484-0994-4b12-b2e1-e87b69da29ef.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"a0120f75-6803-4684-83e0-2f0a5c2e84de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"580396d4-7114-40fd-8509-7b306b1ab4e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143237,"FileName":"c001cbb4-ab60-4d8d-938a-f86a80a8ae8a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136024,"Name":"Sfinx","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"Wacek and Andzia, a pair of school friends, are told by an old Professor that a flying saucer crashed somewhere on Earth.

Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis.\n\nSpace Quest V: The Next Mutation is an adventure game in the Space Quest series. Like its brethren, it is characterized by humorous writing and situations, as well as plenty of opportunities for the hero to die horribly. The game is entirely mouse-controlled: the player interacts with the world by clicking on locations, people and objects on the screen, cycling between various actions (walking, looking, touching or taking, talking, etc.), by clicking the right mouse button or using the icon bar. The latter also contains icons that allow the player to access Roger's inventory, quit the game or change the settings.\n\nCommands for smelling and tasting have been removed, but a special icon for giving orders has been added. It can be used on any object or character in the game, but its actual purpose is to issue specific commands to the crew members: Roger's garbage scow, the Eureka, has a crew over which he presides. The game is plot-driven and contains cutscenes done in a comic book-like style. Plot development is linear, but each planet the protagonist visits usually consists of several screens and contains its own objectives and puzzles. There are also hazardous situations that may occur on the spaceship itself and must be dealt with.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Dynamix","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"fe966d5d-04d7-4f05-933c-3a6b7dea60a9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"df53f040-1249-4f77-a416-fae99bb0a277.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"3481b276-1f36-49c2-a285-505fc7bd426c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"cf59564f-8076-48a2-bccd-08f7a58c1452.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"9862e934-c80f-4fdf-b0f0-0cd3218d46c8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"bce9bfdb-4e94-4670-a672-250b99462a50.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"b43c41e7-0679-4bc8-b87a-c88c414c32d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"8fda5620-7041-4102-8646-7abe6fb48b73.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"0e589320-87d5-43ba-836b-73c0b67773c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143308,"FileName":"995bb9df-1ccf-4ea7-afd5-0ad7fe24756a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143308,"AlternateName":"Space Quest 5: The Next Mutation","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143303,"Name":"Space Quest: Chapter I: The Sarien Encounter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Blast off to the wild worlds of outer space in Space Quest - Chapter One, The Sarien Encounter.

Will they ever discover the secret of this strange world and find a way to get home?\n\nThe Dig is a point-and-click adventure game with a simple one-cursor interface. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based, tending to be somewhat more complex than in most preceding LucasArts' adventure games. There are also a few logic-based puzzles, which require understanding and manipulation of alien technology and life forms on the planet. Traditional branching dialogue system is utilized; however, the game focuses more on puzzle-solving than on conversations to advance the plot.\n\nThe game's story is influenced by science fiction literature and movies, and strives to be realistic, departing from the comedy style of LucasArts' adventures. Despite that, humorous elements are present in some of the dialogues and text descriptions. The game utilizes hand-drawn graphics with a few pre-rendered 3D images.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"LucasArts","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"7e6b4d8d-1950-4fc8-8e99-261d1db4a865.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"45975609-3d69-49eb-9578-cf1a46d68616.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"f1537094-2ad9-4ce4-b4ba-58a139c953ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"b5d4108a-7d10-4061-bebe-b561dea70bc9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"3ca96edc-0b2c-4ca4-a41d-02c90dd08485.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"6644c525-e062-4b4b-9338-50572d8d0b56.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"da4cc1ed-161d-40ef-b7b8-e089621e13f3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"285134e5-ce80-467d-9077-5bab24f31c03.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"23c5f4b9-a696-4a06-b4e8-f488c57e1156.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"f3d70df0-ca7c-42b6-8a4e-f064c580bf77.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"5371b3f7-473a-4ae9-b1a6-4a78c4d4c412.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"0dd26308-a84f-4133-b765-b341b6adc3ff.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"b5c18369-64c4-44ac-bc5d-16282a3591dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137570,"FileName":"7c199609-9607-49c0-b2be-279ca6bfbd5a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143018,"Name":"The Feeble Files","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"This is a humorous point and click adventure game from the creator of the Simon the Sorcerer series of games.

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that it featured all of its animation done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets, rather than 2- or 3-dimensional computer graphics, like many other games at its time. The gameplay consists mostly of the player guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance in the game. As the player advances through different areas of the game, there are various video sequences that help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, The Neverhood aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aO2Z61bT6I","Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"The Neverhood, Inc.","Publisher":"DreamWorks Interactive","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"18e50b1a-f14a-4a32-b973-dbf0ec94ea98.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"280e0b12-b4cf-41e5-868d-702684d287b9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"f5a3a0df-fa59-438a-95ea-719145eb36df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"85e367d4-3d24-4de8-8eab-52468c0c2791.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"c34a86a2-1cb6-4b75-8fd2-653152efa02b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"0661b08d-a35a-461b-bac9-37ce0f89fda0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"3762a092-2fdd-4357-97bf-62518b1b1dd6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"c8adb596-697d-4414-a94f-73d67128d3b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"22a92670-33f7-4188-bc61-b2ede9c95afa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"efae1d2a-50f0-478b-9f63-ebfbefc8f8d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"2c286ec7-1edd-416a-8d8a-8747ba61dfe4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"452dacd8-2470-479a-9462-c924b7ad1071.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143174,"FileName":"d5004d2f-06ad-4dd9-85e1-31e144645ddf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143174,"AlternateName":"The Neverhood Chronicles","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143325,"Name":"The Prophecy","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"This point and click adventure takes a fantasy setting, in which you play a Wizard deemed to be ‘good’ taking on a less good one.

It was the second game to use the SCUMM engine, after Maniac Mansion. The project was led by David Fox, with Matthew Alan Kane as the co-designer and co-programmer. Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that). After having a psychedelic dream one day, Zak realizes that something is wrong -- space aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth. Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Maniac Mansion.\n\nThe FM Towns version, released in 1991, has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"ScummVM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Fujitsu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"2e4b71d9-97bf-4a0e-a0c3-401cf49f48ac.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"439905b0-8bd7-483b-a3d2-b893b2801f20.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"a1800617-ea06-493b-968f-e95bcf9d6661.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"340cc420-83a9-42a2-bcb3-74700c4913ee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"494ae48a-18fe-4db5-875d-7b58235af127.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"ceef97b8-7610-4f0e-86be-80d642aced20.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"f6b27e57-d590-4eaa-9ba6-746c1cf4c47e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143328,"FileName":"5f4ec216-18bb-477c-80c4-fc157a4cbddc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":143328,"AlternateName":"Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":143329,"Name":"Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands is a graphical first person adventure game in the style of Myst, mixing logic puzzles with live-action FMV sequences which advance the story.
