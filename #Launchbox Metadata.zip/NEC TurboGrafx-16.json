There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you.

The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.\n\nControl of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes.

The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress.

After a few seconds, the enemies respawn and resume their chase of the player.\n\nThe five-player option was new to any incarnation of Lode Runner, and operates in a very similar manner to Bomberman, except with hole drilling instead of bombing.","MaxPlayers":"5","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"ad5e1bb0-0bc1-4cc0-a8f7-a9c683d8fefc.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"800bbe15-5969-469e-8afa-b9c32edf57d0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"e1aa73ff-a759-49da-87dd-b7361f075d93.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"6a08e357-7c0e-4dc8-9c9d-033b9f85816a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"5952a28c-c99b-4119-b381-44b1e1da766c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"e202a99c-22cd-4f79-82a9-84b4f9eff94c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"caddaa2d-5c8c-422d-9b7a-a3255e6b17b8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"39812b3f-2b1c-4dc3-83c6-2b9e7e15dc4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20244,"FileName":"2d4b7462-4bc1-445e-ba43-d1fafe7a5c2a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8189,"Name":"Battle Royale","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"It's wrestling mayhem out of control!

One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end to the monster invasion.\n\nBenkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as \"Talk\" or \"Search\", rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"c6d20bc6-62d0-45ab-968c-2bf50d9526e7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"fc17eedd-703c-490b-8e9c-902a612cd406.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"693345dc-63d6-461f-a86d-850deca873e3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"07b18154-b7e9-4a7b-a833-4e29785f7ae8.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"ab154320-798e-4cd9-98db-2e947bb6dd8f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"0ede9fef-ff46-40bb-ad03-de0573b13811.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":20245,"FileName":"8262db16-b47b-4f24-ba49-1b61d7d6ac83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":120103,"Name":"Bikkuriman World","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Despite being Hudson’s Vol.2, this was in fact released almost a month before The Kung Fu.

You start the game with barely a thread on and are given a sword by some wise looking dude who lives in a tree. It is then your task to travel through the various platform-based levels defeating monsters and evil bosses along the way. Each enemy you kill leaves behind a coin or money bag (these are also at various hidden locations if you jump at the right spot) and shops will offer you armour, shields, weaponry and go-faster shoes. You can also pop into a bar and top up your energy if you can afford it.

Knight Sabers 2034  is a PC Engine graphic adventure game based on the anime OVA series of the same name.\n\nThe anime/game is set in the near future of 2032, which has seen Tokyo split into two by a massive earthquake. Corporations rule the country, production-line humanoid robots named \"boomers\" are being used by villains to commit crimes, and the beleaguered police are too under-budgeted and incompetent to handle it all. The all-female mercenary team the Knight Sabers, who use powerful exosuits called \"Hard Suits\", are the city's best defense.\n\nThe game operates similarly to other adventure games of the era. The player is given a selection of commands that they can use to interact with the world, including talking to NPCs, picking up and using objects in their inventory and moving to other areas. At any time the player can look and listen for extra context clues. The commands are in English, but the game's story and dialogue text is entirely Japanese. The game will occasionally switch protagonists, starting with Nene Romanova and moving to Priss, Linna and Sylia at various points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Spiel","Publisher":"Naxat Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"73b269d7-6bf1-4fe6-afe8-767a4ce16c6e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"95220461-49c0-4f41-851f-3ab65dc2e102.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"b04013f7-8b89-40a5-aec5-8d24e43e6058.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"e8af14fb-e474-4e71-b4e5-7cf9f19ddda2.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"79f0a865-10c0-4ee0-9c14-337b185aed00.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"2b45f217-5bd6-4d4f-8e76-8e9842112b36.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"3c538686-9d29-49f8-965a-3da2c4515b3b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":15198,"FileName":"3418d5fb-8940-40ef-b24a-5aa8a0cc6c1c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":15198,"AlternateName":"Bubblegum Crash!: Knight Sabers 2034","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15198,"AlternateName":"Bubblegum Crash!: Knight Sabers 2034","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":20249,"Name":"Bullfight: Ring no Haja","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Select your boxer, select your manager and duke it out for the championship.

He's also a monumental lecher who only accepts beautiful female clients and will do anything to get a peek at their bodies. But keeping watch on him is his partner Kaori, sister to his ex-partner who was killed on one fateful night. Kaori has talents herself, being able to produce enormous mallets seemingly from thin air whenever Ryo is acting up around the ladies - and she isn't afraid to use them.\n\nCity Hunter is based on the very popular manga/anime by Tsukasa Hojo. The game itself is a kind of action/adventure split into several different 'stories', of which you can choose in any order (with the exception of the final chapter). Gameplay mostly involves running around buildings, shooting the bad guys that constantly appear ahead of you and trying out the doorways scattered around. These doors often lead to separate rooms, sometimes with that essential character in that you need to talk to to progress the story. Aside from armed mobsters, you'll also have to navigate around laser beams, crushing machines and spikes that shoot from the ground. Around each level you will also find a nurse to heal you - although stumbling into a room with a semi-naked gal inside has pretty much the same effect. As you progress through the levels, you also gain extra weaponry - the bazooka being particularly useful in a crowded room.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBaHnbwccP0","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"30f33704-4f68-4333-9b70-a2e9f0218e53.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"75d86e42-7a01-4c89-b0c8-e049a611fc44.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"12867615-75bd-4c59-9fae-5e6b2bb4dd39.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"f00088de-239c-4e67-9b6d-062265583d6a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"d94aff0a-8dbc-40b2-a1cd-e8a61b503c68.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"db4af1a2-ccc1-4630-b9f5-90a0f2247db9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"e1455d3b-bee5-4221-b308-9839f00fa10e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18402,"FileName":"9390fb8e-5b0a-4f6d-9292-52a7df52e793.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23255,"Name":"Columns","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.\n\nAs well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Shin-Nihon Laser Soft Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"dd87a06e-86f5-4a3d-907b-592305338054.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"ba53191d-6ca1-4d52-bd31-abe213389a35.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"85b98082-0575-45b7-b7ba-e0d0a09bcc85.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"69fefb7b-fa80-4c94-b16d-5a090f1b65bc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"8de5e8e0-27a5-465b-96f9-8ee5d8b948a9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"f3a26454-88a0-40a1-aa69-8b4481e5f569.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"18027cda-246b-4d33-8108-96300dccd125.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23255,"FileName":"cc37e371-01a9-445e-b0b4-53bda8f0ced0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18403,"Name":"Coryoon: Child of Dragon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Horizontal shoot 'em up that casts you as a baby dragon out to free a princess from the clutches of an evil....well, you get the idea.

There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.\n\nThe Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends.

The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only six are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them.

The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress.

The game is on a fast seasonal cycle - a minute represents a month - and various crops do better (or worse) depending on the time of the year.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Salio","Publisher":"Salio","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"5bc8fcff-0a14-4122-a03c-4b3f384f2afa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"35eb1e20-e240-464e-bbb1-2a10ba406263.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"35858d75-bbd3-4c15-ac2e-5b65fe07a421.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"2a0ddbfb-5e9d-456c-a712-ca730a7b82fa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"fb0f0257-736a-4585-9b4a-8b7b735aa57d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"240824db-58f9-4713-9d5b-3f045c1d355e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"407865d1-56a7-485f-a719-604ea7ad09db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":103949,"FileName":"c6ff3fde-b687-4034-8fa2-ebcd7fbd53f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32840,"Name":"Daisenpu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Daisenpu is a vertical shooter by Nec Interchannel and conversion of the arcade game of the same name (also known as Twin Hawk) originally released by Toaplan in 1989. In the year 193X, country R is overwhelmed by hostile enemy forces and the small oasis town 'S' is the main target of the attack. A handful of survivors escape to the jungle and start working on a counter attack - but they are soon discovered and are now running out of time, and they must launch the Daisenpu squadron before it is fully operational. The player takes control of a fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy territory, attack ground targets such as tanks, turrets and warships (the game curiously doesn't feature any flying enemies and no obstacles to fly into, beside enemy bullets). The plane starts equipped with a limited double-shot machine gun that can be slowly upgraded throughout the game by collecting power-pods left behind by small trucks. But the originality of Daisenpu lies elsewhere - the player can call a small squadron of six planes and have them fly in formation, shooting anything in sight and crashing into an enemy unit when defeated. The squadron can also commit a Kamikaze attack at anytime and destroy ground units, or combine to release a devastative bomb-attack. Finally, Daisenpu offers an unusual feature - levels do not pause between them and reveal instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Center Tech","Publisher":"NEC","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"2a03c148-1abf-44cd-9899-0b252f271f25.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"46203810-7683-47e7-a8a5-a6a255562295.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"d648603f-8313-4f42-a719-ae7f68b75327.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"b0f97bf5-b960-4a84-b5fb-30927d0f7e51.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"7946d716-7883-410a-98ce-5f5f07233926.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"9b76f6a7-f5af-4040-adc8-c433cbf83825.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"2b654bd9-fb53-4ce4-91da-e7a14cd6e029.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"FileName":"d6bdebc2-d907-484b-8197-9c576166fd93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":32840,"AlternateName":"Daisenpuu","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32840,"AlternateName":"Twin Hawk","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32840,"AlternateName":"Daisenpuu","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32840,"AlternateName":"Daisenpuu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":27809,"Name":"Darius Alpha","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"One of the rarest games for the PC Engine, Darius Alpha was only offered to those who bought both the CD and HuCard versions of Darius Plus (Which doesn't make much sense, considering how similar the two versions are).

The same version could also be played on the SuperGrafx and had special features that would enhance the experience when played on that system in particular - similar to how certain Game Boy games would be enhanced when used with the Super Game Boy peripheral.

A new charge-shot feature has been added to your basic arsenal, and the game features single and 2-player cooperative gameplay.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-28T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"7b52778c-5e81-4f01-a56d-db9c9b45a810.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"5a064c79-c72e-4c01-99c4-483ba2b9c022.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"c904ba47-891d-45a1-900e-062dc75d6447.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"79294672-3534-445b-9b7c-af4227db4fa8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"6980de4e-97b4-4f5c-a7d2-52e91922ecf0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"12b0c23d-4ccd-4694-b1f0-ab282604e8f1.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"ed5fd86e-dc37-40f0-9a18-b1eee33b3cd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23257,"FileName":"c51f3aca-6603-4cab-906e-56b54cfc2162.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5663,"Name":"Devil's Crush","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Play video pinball that will set you on fire!

As John McClane, it is the player's job to stop the terrorists that have taken over Nakatomi Plaza in downtown LA, as per the plot of the 1988 movie upon which the game is based.\n\nThe game takes several liberties with the source material, starting McClane off in what appears to be a jungle before moving him to a Vietnamese river full of tall bamboo before finally reaching the basement of Nakatomi Plaza.\n\nMcClane can fire in eight directions, once he finds a weapon, and can move and jump through each of the game's top-down stages. Occasionally, he'll need to use his jump to avoid obstacles on the ground, such as pitfalls. He can gain extra armor by finding colored vests; once he's low on health, he'll lose the standard white vest to reveal an injured torso.\n\nAs well as the basic machine gun and shotgun, John can also find weapons with a lot more power but far smaller ammunition counts such as flamethrowers and rocket launchers.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","Publisher":"Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"f2c6bc15-c5da-4341-9c42-98f5df3e70db.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"c3d37a66-2175-434c-8b41-ea2b0aa289bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"bb6100fb-6959-44a5-81b4-082ebc5a9bed.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"20ee5be8-f93e-469f-b817-e1d91cef43ea.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"e36da074-c4f7-4182-a2c9-0bd27aa00b68.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"ef61cbba-39e8-4f84-8733-72466c764523.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"0619638c-447d-4cb2-aaef-d92fc206001e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"4003a4e2-08ba-4a9b-a2ff-42349979ede8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"c594ed4c-df71-4939-a410-d4c0e334c9fb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"bb9b7fea-bfd9-4e03-84f1-de535d228206.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"48eee1df-5668-48bf-a2f7-a0cdd81cf082.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"9d446241-da54-4a30-9afc-8f24fb0cbefe.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"aba62e5f-ce7e-479f-bc2a-5c0f45cc4c84.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":23276,"FileName":"121ef49d-2fa4-4e29-b59f-d359d0fbab7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":23277,"Name":"Digital Champ: Battle Boxing","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Take to the ring and fight against strangely familiar looking opponents in this first-person boxing game.

All this is done over scenery ranging from woodlands to strangely un-fantasy like hi-tech fortresses.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Tenky","Publisher":"NCS","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"d1b03e26-731f-4801-a12c-70bc8e1a5f3d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"3d0cbefa-b002-4ede-bddf-dc33c28a3925.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"308d1406-e32c-4d62-b59c-8d75fe55cce0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"96b8f411-0d35-4fac-85af-149625a26ff1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"2a0f5bf8-c2ad-4b1c-be22-f69386b096fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"cfa73acc-fffb-4518-a18e-5be45fa72d1d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"1222d8df-f00c-4aac-b3c1-a5fd85eb5dc1.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"68eb6adc-063d-4b25-b6d1-e5f0f0fdc74e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18443,"FileName":"60043eda-c08b-4c4e-90ea-897f3f391442.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32829,"Name":"Dragon Saber","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Whereas Dragon Spirit was a multi-format conversion, only Turbo-Grafx / PC Engine users initially got to play the lesser-known sequel at home. Gameplay-wise, little has changed from the original, as both games are vertically-scrolling shoot 'em ups putting you in control of a dragon. You are flying over built-up land, complete with rivers and their banks. The enemies and waves can be shot or avoided - shooting them reveals extra points as well as the occasional power-up. Ground units are shooting at you but can't be shot back, so be careful which parts of the screen you occupy at which times. The game now supports two-player simultaneous gameplay: Huey, the blue dragon, and Siria, the red dragon, are player one and player two respectively.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Now Production","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"a52a8876-f3ff-491f-96f8-82ee3488503d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"6d36ba90-b79d-48a0-ac73-04b95179d30a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"f6dfcacb-4379-43de-a22e-c343c7b600e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"2b4c7864-5ce8-4a31-967b-257986bccb5b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"df9312d2-3bef-4553-b901-cd3687a0fe78.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"b6499dfb-f716-43ff-8254-bc252dedf5a6.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"860ba557-9e18-4ead-88cd-2d66ab280cb1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32829,"FileName":"c1b1bff2-afed-4ae2-996e-cccbc9208f44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":32829,"AlternateName":"Doragon Seiba","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32829,"AlternateName":"Dragon Saber: After Story of Dragon Spirit","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":5666,"Name":"Dragon Spirit","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Amur, the spirit of the dragon, lives within you.

From a top-down perspective and decorated with cute \"deformed\" graphics, it may offer a serious challenge. There are essentially two race instances: first you have to beat the clock in a single lap to qualify for a good position in the race, and second you have to beat your opponents. You also have to keep an eye on your car's condition, as the tyres and body wear out, so part of your strategy must consider pit stops.\n\nDespite its looks, F-1 Dream is not a parody game. Released in 1988, it's in fact very respectful towards the sport, featuring little details which add realism to it. This includes several real brands advertised in the game, and others which have one or two letters changed in the logo, but are very easy to recognize. So it is with your opponents, featuring the great Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost or Nigel Mansell. The car behavior also features skids when speeding at corners, gears, and damage.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"NEC Interchannel","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"ff571785-f48a-4ef7-a6d8-4554e1b9c0e6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"8a3c8333-1d0b-477f-8a22-9ada60214d9c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"57072162-a98d-4e44-aef4-d36c9c8aae9c.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"ce7e284f-e985-42b1-a133-4d99f57eb3c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"99a74f78-b988-4589-b826-3ac49ad43316.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"952c72b5-caa2-4517-b6c5-bcbb3aba1e5a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"aabde337-77df-4f4a-aafe-fd4dec6478a0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104627,"FileName":"7b8bf01a-bc3f-4096-9d9e-33ed064f796e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":106152,"Name":"F-1 Pilot","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"F-1 Pilot is a F1 racing game for the PC Engine, one that depicts the racing from the driver's seat of the vehicle.

By pushing RUN then selecting your power with BUTTON I, you get the chance to do such things as show hidden power-ups and become invincible for a short time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYjQY6McqSY","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Sankindo","Publisher":"FACE","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"a1d24849-bf35-4959-9605-d7fd104ca60c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"297de559-2531-401f-97bd-19a01ca12355.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"ec9fd9b5-eab1-4d2d-95e4-eba972b9b807.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"452d86ed-ed62-42f9-ac0d-ca5dddafb2f8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"c7abc89e-50a3-43e3-9406-25a15800975e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"3acea2a5-1cbe-4c46-b742-e334cfb3616a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"1def29d6-95e8-442a-a241-8ee2f67b89ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":30101,"FileName":"bacf8802-29ad-4c13-a2be-8483030bc16a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":30101,"AlternateName":"Alice in Wonderland","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":106939,"Name":"Gai Flame","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gai Flame (or Gaiflame) is sci-fi, turn-based strategy, with giant, heavy armed humanoid robots.

The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monshō is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a69UhcQT7Cc","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"NCS","Publisher":"NCS","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"d3d65fc2-1175-464a-89a5-5cd83ca7f012.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"6e592c98-76ec-498b-9984-054a6c440eb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"65c22f29-71a1-4fa7-9ab0-ae3e442c501f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"6fb229ab-c22d-4d54-af54-c5d3cd2c0bb3.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"a8d6a6ea-93b9-47a1-839e-107ee2865d06.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"99b560e0-57e3-43aa-a493-520043316677.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32834,"FileName":"d0f3b6ab-8f81-427a-b164-abf1bfed7c26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":32834,"AlternateName":"The Crest of Gaia","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":5671,"Name":"Galaga '90","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Galaga is a smouldering planet that often erupts with angry mutants and misfits.

But this time around he's not flying or shooting balls of energy - instead, he must run along a roadway divided into four lanes, each moving at different speeds. And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!). Hanii on the Road consists of many levels and features a non-linear structure with interconnected paths to follow, as well as bosses.

And since this is two-on-two hockey, the action is fast and furious as you try to outscore and outslug your opponent in four-player hockey action.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"07ea48f9-82ad-4694-8a3e-800f19f5627a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"57b126f9-6b8f-46d2-bf20-f06767b2f30a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"79b7501d-bea1-492a-8d67-ca7a515228d3.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"1b92f962-ce20-416a-98cc-d7e7a9407f6d.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"0a23d4d4-ce11-49ca-b929-5fdc38dc3728.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"2b4bc498-2bb6-4890-ab45-34fe0170be73.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"cb4a998a-297b-471b-afc1-0ad8b117cb37.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"123fa3a5-5b0c-4d8a-a164-a16d1bb31cdb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"23974455-641b-4633-b361-357f46de0a81.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"a86083b7-368b-4266-9790-ad1a2c40a6fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"9736923e-0912-42d4-8262-62d5c5dac067.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"df96b6a8-17a1-4e29-a6b4-24025b6921ca.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"8d0d16a0-0e3a-4d49-bafa-bd782f7ec5ed.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8209,"FileName":"31f71b8c-f650-4c73-9fea-cb2458bfbbb1.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8209,"AlternateName":"Hit the Ice: VHL: The Official Video Hockey League","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8209,"AlternateName":"Hit The Ice","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":34717,"Name":"Honoo no Toukyuuji: Dodge Danpei","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Honoo no Toukyuuji: Dodge Danpei is a dodgeball game that is based on a shounen serialized manga about a highschool dodgeball team.

The player takes control of the OF-1, a powerful Orbit Fighter ship codenamed Daidalos on a mission to annihilate the Moon defense system which suddenly went out of control. The rather unique feature of Image Fight is the \"simulation mode\" (called 'Image Fight') that precedes the \"real battle\" (called 'Real Fight'). The game counts a grand total of eight zones - the first five are Combat Training Stages and happen in a virtual space where the player must at least achieve a whooping 90% destruction ratio. If successful, the Real Combat reveals itself and the player gets launched in outer space and fly through three more stages. Just like with any traditional shooter, the ship can be upgraded by collecting flying capsules. They come in two flavors - the first are colored pods (blue and red) which hang around the ship and either fire straight ahead or in the opposite direction the fighter is facing. Those pods can also be thrown at the enemies to inflict more damage. The other kind are various devices that attach at the front of the ship and greatly improve its fire power - they include Bubble lasers, Homing Lasers, V Lasers or the powerful Drill Laser. Sadly, only one can be collected at the same time and the only way to dispose of them is to get hit. Finally, the speed of the ship can be adjusted anytime during the game and the resulting blast of energy can even be used to damage enemy ships.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Irem","Publisher":"Hudson","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"3b3ab346-7835-49f3-92f6-85913da17479.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"3669facd-855b-4ab4-ac79-5474bd293b25.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"a2c47879-a973-4152-b989-fc59594d62c6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"de3cddf4-4394-4921-b5be-c4d7b10e760a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"b51e0d45-443c-44b7-8a8f-2c59a34e4294.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"f7893b0f-6f3f-4939-a179-2a2260437a50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32835,"FileName":"3794034a-6f7c-4226-89c3-fc4fe285c28e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":8210,"Name":"Impossamole","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"For Monty Mole, a day at the beach turns into the adventure of his life when he's beamed aboard an alien spacecraft.

To ensure victory, the Gods had to sacrifice part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that had both good and bad in it - the \"Evil Holy Sword\" Necromancer. The demons were forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven. Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept this plan for co-existence. They have murdered the king of the human continent Ishumeria, and it's time for the nameless hero of this story to seek out the legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world.\n\nJaseiken Necromancer plays like a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game: top-down navigation, linear story progression, turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies, automatic leveling up, etc. A somewhat unusual (for the time) feature is the player's ability to choose two companions for the hero among six possible ones. These warriors are introduced to the hero after he accepts his quest, and the player can build a party of three, trying to balance between physical and magical skills they possess.\n\nThe game is also notable for its rather dark themes, uncommon for the representatives of its genre at that time. Enemies mostly include demonic creatures, and their death animation contains graphical gore.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-22T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34809,"FileName":"36e076f7-f02f-47f0-86ea-b7be6693a422.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34809,"FileName":"16e17f1a-20bc-487f-b063-1f9550e23c8f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34809,"FileName":"889205c8-d3be-4179-a8fc-e567f6ff18ca.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34809,"FileName":"7ff461e0-080c-4d0f-b381-ef3d02afe2a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34809,"FileName":"fe14a9ac-c875-4bfe-88c3-12646c4d1f50.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34809,"FileName":"82e925db-1fe6-4a48-9cc3-a3c3d8192ff3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":34809,"AlternateName":"Necromancer","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":18411,"Name":"Jigoku Meguri","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"In this cute but spooky platformer, the player takes control of a small and completely bald Buddhist monk, the high priest bonze Kackremboh, who is on a perilous journey through the depths of Hell.

One day, the hero meets a man who tells him a sad story: monsters have kidnapped his granddaughter, and locked her away in a tower. Apparently, the monsters also took away nine other young girls, and have some evil plans in mind. The hero agrees to venture into the tower's labyrinth and succeed where no other adventurer could...\n\nLady Sword is a first-person solo dungeon crawler. The player navigates the hero through the complex, maze-like corridors of the tower (with an auto-map feature), trying to find the right way to the stairs to the next floor. Fake walls, teleporters, one-way doors, items that must be collected to unlock hidden passages, boss enemies, etc., are there to make this task harder than it looks. Regular enemies pop out randomly, and must be defeated in a very simple turn-based combat.\n\nThere is no damage feedback for the hero (though the player can see exactly how badly the hero himself is hurt), no weapons, armor, or items for combat usage. The player can heal the hero's wounds by selecting \"sleep\" from the menu. Sleeping restores the hero to full HP; but if he rests too much, a tough demon will appear and attack.\n\nCharacter growth is handled via direct stat increasing; there are no \"levels\", and the hero's HP, attack and defense power, as well as agility, increase gradually the more he fights.\n\nOn each floor, a digitized photo of a young woman will greet the hero and encourage the player to explore further - at the stairs to the next floor, should the hero overcome all the obstacles, the player will be able to see the girl naked.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Games Express","Publisher":"Games Express","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"26720a29-9b81-4976-9b41-92497f3be07f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"bc2aca5f-0661-4958-860a-62403e3ed5e1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"5d206e8e-9051-4fd9-9144-c5c60175ca66.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"cc227831-5555-470e-8bfd-f0e35009868a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"8fe0c789-94b5-45f8-ab7c-26b698657712.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"20b6c05b-c75f-4aa1-9975-23ec9cc9e00e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34807,"FileName":"865e7f7b-fd3f-4a99-bb25-4991afd28a0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":34807,"AlternateName":"Lady Sword","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34807,"AlternateName":"Lady Sword: The 10 Captive Maidens","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":8216,"Name":"Legend of Hero Tonma","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Legend of Hero Tonma is an action game that puts players in control of the magic-user Tonma, whose role – as was typical for game heroes of the day – is to travel to another world and save the princess.

It was ported to the Famicom by Bothtec in 1988. Micro Cabin then ported the game one final time to the PC Engine in 1989. The game is based on the popular manga and anime series of the same name, Maison Ikkoku.\n\nThe story is a bitter-sweet comedic romance involving a group of madcap people who live in a boarding house in 1980s Tokyo. The story focuses primarily on the gradual developing relationships between Yusaku Godai, a poor student down on his luck, and Kyoko Otonashi, a young, recently-widowed boarding house manager.\n\nIn the game, you take the role of Godai performing various missions that deal with the storyline of Maison Ikkoku. You have to avoid Yotsuya's pranks, save money to throw a party, proclaim your love for Kyoko and other things. The action takes place all over Tokeizaka and not just the boarding house. Players can visit Soichiro's grave, Chachamaru, the train station and many other familiar locales.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"090b6053-d79d-4555-a117-2ebbc159777b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"c6b27323-41ae-4762-a77d-5da47433c080.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"6d070350-b57e-4dfb-9617-aa57fdcbb047.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"d3637bda-68de-426e-9dda-a3bb5761d72a.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"c1b1421a-7383-483e-8879-7da737588cbd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"1a553d34-709d-40b3-bf4a-e15ca78ecc10.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"7845b2f9-c2fc-431c-9bd2-c27d6b49e235.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33507,"FileName":"8bd1e024-b542-4d96-9783-711163889c18.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":120225,"Name":"Makai Hakkenden Shada","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The story of this game is loosely based on the 19th century Japanese epic novel Nanso Satomi Hakkenden (\"Tale of Eight Dogs\") by Kyokutei Bakin. In the game, the player controls a young warrior named Shin. The elder of his home village tells him that a magical artifact known as the Statue of the Four Gods has been stolen. This artifact was sealing away the spirit of the evil Tamazusa. To prevent Tamazusa's resurrection, Shin must find seven other warriors. Only when they are united can the evil be defeated once and for all...\n\nDespite the premise of eight warriors, Makai Hakkenden Shada is an action RPG in which the player controls only Shin. The game is similar to the better-known Ys games in many ways. As in Ys, the hero fights enemies simply by \"bumping\" into them. Defeated enemies produce money, which can be spent in villages to purchase weapons and various types of armor, and experience points. Once a set amount of those is accumulated, the hero gains a level.\n\nLater in the game Shin receives spells and special techniques, which must be executed actively, by pressing a button. There is also a \"search\" command in the game, which is required to use to solve certain situations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Data East Corporation","Publisher":"Data East Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1989-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"7ab55d9f-a1f2-405d-af50-3afeb6703619.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"86a6934a-728a-4d37-81e9-21076df140f5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"1ee9cc38-be7f-40b2-a378-d52a737e9e43.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"391e3eee-fa2f-4070-942e-862e3a950970.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"eda734ee-ce71-48a1-9c48-dc27b11740dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"54954030-9295-4d91-b135-0fc577c61971.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":120225,"FileName":"dc2845ad-d8b7-4d95-91ff-1df3deb8ede7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30102,"Name":"Makai Prince Dorabocchan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Makai Prince Dorabocchan (\"Demon Prince Dorabo\") is a 2D platformer for the PC Engine.

But a mysterious organization that calls itself Mars began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as FW, into the depths of the ruins, to face the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge...\n\nOut Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are also machines and robots of different kinds.\n\nBefore venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot's energy. Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points.\n\nA somewhat unusual feature is double leveling: the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m2yYPQlk8M","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Sunsoft","ReleaseDate":"1989-03-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"bc99e39d-04f7-4e66-8c59-6fbb70b5378c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"9e7ba72a-0743-4d9d-a629-18f00f4ec85f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"a64b4f24-c78b-4ef6-b255-9a8038924836.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"b4ff49ad-8b3a-4837-90e9-c838c3054259.JPG","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"3a892a3f-ac89-49a5-87ef-6a2754d1eac0.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"fdbd440b-ba88-48f2-a0b9-b4b78aa586b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"f6ff76b3-f8f7-4e9a-95bf-cee262cd3a0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"d81d4a9b-a979-4b0c-8ec3-33a720a1201f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121283,"FileName":"a47c6b28-af4d-4b4d-a219-c9bdc02b575f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":121283,"AlternateName":"Out Live: It's Far a Future on Planet","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":26094,"Name":"Out Run","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Barrel down the straightaway and bank your way into turns as you master the world's most challenging raceway.

The player can also choose between different formations and after successful matches athletes can be substituted. The most unusual aspect of the game is the power rating which is lowered when using the power mode which allows faster movement and forceful shots. However, the power does only get completely refilled after a match so it needs to be used with care. Because the activation of this mode takes up a button, there is no dedicated passing button to be found. The distance of a shot is chosen by pressing the fire button quickly or holding it.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-02q4CEfwU4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"West One","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"96bdf6ae-676c-41bf-9921-5769bb8f4aec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"73080c1b-de94-498a-8395-1fbb907a5333.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"a8619361-82ae-43cc-a166-7ff2b7fe7a2e.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"2afcada4-ad30-4bb7-b9f4-6afa4c66f7a7.JPG","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"3ba6ef96-9c45-40fb-a43c-d1d440d7af65.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"bc4e3975-56ff-4f3a-ae48-94eed730a9fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"e1be7459-cd48-450c-a5e8-b6386534e6f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121355,"FileName":"b9ea3e88-39ac-4b75-b3d4-334568b4f370.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":121356,"Name":"Power Gate","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Power Gate is a horizontal shoot 'em up developed by Make and published by Pack-in-Video.\n\nThe game is a fairly standard example of its genre, with a handful of power-ups that include bombs for attacking ground targets, as well as more powerful weapons that can only be used once apiece.

The Bydo Empire, a mysterious alien civilization and life form, is about to take over the Earth and the solar system. The R-9 star fighter seems to be humanity's only hope against the invasion and the small ship is sent to stop the massive threat. The fighter can use an arsenal of weapons including a standard Vulcan gun and ballistic missiles. But the real super-weapon of the ship is the force - a glowing orb made from alien technology and its basic function it to float near the R-9 and to protect it. It can however be upgraded throughout the game or charged up to fire powerful blasts of energy. Another important feature of the Force is the way how it can be shot in whatever direction it's facing - this tactic is often necessary to take down the various bosses or simply wreak havoc to the Bydo Empire. Unlike the American edition of the game, R-Type was released in Japan on two HuCards and the version tested here only includes the last four stages from the arcade game (The Den, Transport System, A City in Decay and A Star Occupied by the Bydo Empire).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsLzgHL9r8o","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Irem Corp.","Publisher":"Irem Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1988-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":176935,"FileName":"5ab5de2e-dc00-4721-86c8-5adebf0a09d8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176935,"FileName":"52d66428-b857-4cc5-8518-bf8be43e9685.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176935,"FileName":"b72d6faf-3260-4b1f-9c05-bd96826aab83.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":176935,"FileName":"60d83624-4c74-4b6e-b249-c700ec0e714b.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176935,"FileName":"13ae0723-31d0-43ea-a250-b1a991fc7355.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":176935,"AlternateName":"R-TYPE Part 2","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176935,"AlternateName":"R-Type Part 2","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":121383,"Name":"Ryukyu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ryukyu is an unusual puzzle game produced by Ascii Corporation and published by Face.

The game field is made of a uniform \"five by five\" grid. Playing cards are dropped from the top of the field and fill up these empty spaces. When a row, a column or a diagonal of five cards is filled, the game awards the player points for creating poker hands (card combinations) such as pairs, straights or flushes. The goal of the game is to gain the maximum amount of points and maybe achieve a perfect Clear. Ryukyu offers different play modes - solo modes often give the player an opportunity to reveal a picture with a cute girl in bikini made of mosaic tiles (if only they can manage to cleanup the field and unlock them all).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDLP7NFEBrA","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"ASCII Corporation","Publisher":"FACE","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-26T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"57a8a44e-e115-4ed4-a67f-0ed143d2ed70.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"024fac7c-66b5-4e03-82ef-380ee35544a7.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"105d98e0-50bc-418c-92ab-28dce88a9713.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"6e99dbfb-0874-4784-94b7-8ca9012e03b2.JPG","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"381d2004-abb8-47d9-bc94-de8527a3585d.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"1c1c5878-161a-4bbc-a73c-4b25069b03dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"ceacb531-2f91-42d8-b43f-e857a67b2892.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121383,"FileName":"0cbae60f-aec1-40df-b57c-db2be026db9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":121383,"AlternateName":"Ryuukyuu","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":121383,"AlternateName":"Ryuukyuu","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":121383,"AlternateName":"Ryuukyuu","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":29049,"Name":"S.C.I: Special Criminal Investigation","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor's daughter, and Chase Special Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are believed to be involved in the kidnapping.

All boss fights are fought in this form, after which the player moves onto the next world as the straw hat boy again.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvPuqg3qz-w","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","Publisher":"Tonkin House","ReleaseDate":"1989-10-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"6534e5a0-0b5f-4a66-8808-cdffc7289536.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"2309518c-464f-4258-97d6-7304b6e9d71f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"ef33d597-9170-4088-8a25-20e6eee4af61.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"c175a558-3ffc-4e66-86fb-3d23c666a883.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"3f6f78ef-1f3b-48dc-9478-87c084caa277.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"a874b3c0-26dd-4cad-8315-4f5386df7296.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"5b1f4ff0-8486-4228-8b61-33134449e67e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121399,"FileName":"07eb65b4-47a1-4d8f-bac6-b16f03ca80d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":121399,"AlternateName":"Dragon Fighter","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":121399,"AlternateName":"Tatsunoko Fighter","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":32833,"Name":"Tatsujin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The evil Dogurava, commander of an alien army known as the Gidans, is attacking the planet Borogo.

The player controls a fighter craft that has to eliminate the enemies with primary weapons or bombs.

Beside increased attack power, the weapons also may gain additional properties when powering up (e.g. the Power Shot creates a shield around the player-controlled aircraft). Other power-up effects include increasing the ship's maneuvering speed up to four times, increasing the number of bombs, and gaining additional lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeLhcTs1NfY","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sting","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"aa28ecee-1050-47f2-afc5-97597f012baa.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"0ce0cc22-e05d-4d74-a9e6-bfe9f0cca7e0.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"1920b13e-495b-40fd-a834-6086196b7022.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"03aecd7b-62d5-4947-a562-199652d65959.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"48449ac1-69a9-460d-b27d-7b2cb95c3466.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"684417bb-b040-4156-8a5a-d0038d704732.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"84dee30a-a394-4788-8973-54d16eb95e92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":32833,"FileName":"520370d2-8cbc-4cc5-87e2-e8c0052d171f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":32833,"AlternateName":"Truxton","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":132783,"Name":"Ten no Koe Bank","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"An accessory that was released for the NEC PC Engine video game console in 1991.

Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPN4cKVillo","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Beat 'em Up","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","Publisher":"NEC","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"f4215115-e790-4db5-a39b-364e2d1530d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"554efdee-d16d-4dae-a507-b52030a740d1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"4035c0bf-8267-49e1-a7d7-e7b877372e42.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"6aaf98a4-acdb-4c6b-a9fc-7c10b73582c4.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"d6c488f9-e88a-43ce-a92f-190f66a41e8f.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"92660b35-d654-406a-845a-fa58b875cdb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"af462b3b-15c6-4c40-8a8d-01db45c2d701.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"50a2cf68-a700-4623-9ac9-913f0b02cd25.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"fd37b1b0-9c58-4af2-8793-b8cdc9891976.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"0f1953b6-c4e4-4c88-b692-42d0f81762a7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"8954f405-609c-4d31-a85b-5ed9cbc87d00.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"c7000d3d-a29e-4ae9-8985-dee07aadef5e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"e0d56c94-9ec3-414b-98c8-fa95772f1eee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"8ddcbace-25d0-4f4a-8693-06f375762315.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"FileName":"5608c847-965e-4608-ad02-eaee60e25121.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5683,"AlternateName":"Tora e no Michi","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":5683,"AlternateName":"Tora heno Michi","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":8238,"Name":"Time Cruise","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Time Cruise is a pinball game from FACE with a sci-fi theme and multiple tables.

Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.\n\nThe labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.\n\nTitan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels).

Volfied is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an ship/object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along. When not cutting the ship is protected by a shield the shield decreases over time and when it hits zero the enemies can also kill you when not cutting.\n\nThe player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points. Most levels contain power-up blocks these power-ups can be claimed when the area around it is removed. Possible power-ups are increased speed (S), time frees for the enemies (T), pause you shield from counting down (P), a laser to shoot the smaller enemies (L), all smaller enemies are killed instantly (C) and a weapon to kill the boss (a red tomato only found in blocks with the red light).\n\nThis game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=firsRUHuIFo","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"2da5ca79-3337-43e8-a908-aebe52251171.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"174a574d-8d80-4130-803f-cb4b0d356621.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"d363a436-497d-451a-99e8-93798960f546.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"7dd38117-d422-432a-8c57-d958970a5e2f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"bbb11854-4e59-489c-b2b3-1d8f99ecf47f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"3cdfef95-399a-4d53-8cfb-c4292eecfc98.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"a89ccb74-6656-49de-8f84-ad86771be902.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"58f92208-d827-4c8f-8187-1c5d004a7346.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"1c5d0326-9f92-41a2-a210-5afec229418a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":101392,"FileName":"834f6e41-75f1-466f-8028-674546108bd5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18419,"Name":"W Ring: The Double Rings","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"W Ring is a horizontally scrolling shooter in which the player sits in a space ship and shoots a lot of enemies, preferably without being hit by their deadly shots or touch.

The basic goal for both is to have the lowest amount of hits after 18 holes, but in the second mode there are penalty points assigned for every hit above the hole's limit.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWztW0mywO4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Data East Corporation","Publisher":"Data East Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1989-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"6253f632-8808-4d45-a7e2-089c5ffc7b98.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"af781cad-87d4-4969-8fdb-68a1543f3d85.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"d668103f-db2b-4545-b08d-d669e9f2d8bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"3805458b-1b1a-4aa0-8b42-7e621f6bedaa.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"bbd87300-9a32-4348-9aa0-1489693de7af.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"2fd8f28a-3524-4477-9c6b-cd6222b66ae4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":121412,"FileName":"ce4eefaa-1ae6-4f24-8612-84d5ea3204cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180063,"Name":"Wonder Boy in Monster Land","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Eleven years have gone by since Tom-Tom rescued his girlfriend Tanya from the clutches of the evil King. Word of Tom-Tom's dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.\n\nEventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land's last hope.\n\nThere are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he'll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Escape","Publisher":"Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":180063,"FileName":"b0548136-02cc-44fe-93c3-5bb1e3a805eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180063,"FileName":"e7cff7b0-d187-4954-8bc3-58f26439ce3d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":180063,"FileName":"d7295ae4-ac50-4ccf-90a1-a245d38db2a5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":121414,"Name":"Wonder Momo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wonder Momo is an action game starring a girl named Momo.

Depending on just how well he behaves in this afterlife you can see up to 5 different endings, which involve everything from re-incarnation to eternal damnation in hell.\n\nYōkai Dōchūki plays as a side-scrolling action platformer, in which you control Tarosuke as he jumps around the game world, avoiding pitfalls and other traps. Enemies can be defeated by the use of a ki-based projectile attack and, once defeated, monsters leave behind money which can be exchanged in-game for health and other unique power-ups. Bosses are based on several Buddhist tales; being much too powerful for Tarosuke, he must invoke his guardian spirit to defeat such demons, which involves finding a shrine and praying until it is summoned.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=268vNmO93YM","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"abc2d770-4e62-4c92-854b-076746b17b57.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"07f07055-e2e6-4c29-a3a2-58fdd5c6efe3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"24cdca47-1f4b-424a-9b2d-8600718742fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"24f7baef-29ba-4086-9b15-ca18538d7309.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"9b185173-7564-4512-9319-9541b2ca6e7a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"31e4340d-3f50-4804-a25b-e3eda6d7ff7a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"fc560971-7847-477d-9ce7-29d3770924dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":104177,"FileName":"5b6b7336-da8b-4cc9-bd39-f3ec8ce4d9a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":104177,"AlternateName":"Yōkai Dōchūki","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":111646,"Name":"Yuu Yuu Jinsei: Victory Life","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Yū Yū Jinsei: Victory Life is a video game adaption of the board game \"The Game of Life\" for up to five players, either controlled by human or computer players.

A versus mode allows players to compete against each other or computer AI in first-person-view races; however, the game's main mode is the Story Mode, which has strong simulation elements. The player takes the role of a young racer, competing in tournaments and gradually advancing in rank. It is possible to buy car parts or whole vehicles, as well as customize cars. Money is obtained from prizes or by doing part-time jobs. These jobs are sometimes designed as mini-games; for example, working as a security guard involves inspecting rooms in a first-person environment. It is also possible to play simple arcade games such as UFO catcher or Turbo Racing.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9S5pyGUyg4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Media Rings","Publisher":"Media Rings","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"882fe444-374b-4e73-a016-39ef21c3cb21.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"35660699-296a-4b15-b618-f214ca926bc3.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"6b16dea7-cb94-474f-a6fd-c8ee36895f52.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"aa66f8ad-4103-48c3-a95c-789dbcf57b34.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"f90ff164-8fc7-4d61-8d57-ce2edc29c6a2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"5604998f-fcf8-4f09-acae-3da11769a5de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":111220,"FileName":"2bd40c03-3625-46cb-b06f-0762826dff1a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":111220,"AlternateName":"Zero 4 Champ","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":32159,"Name":"Zipang","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Action block puzzle game, known in another guise as Solomon's Key.
