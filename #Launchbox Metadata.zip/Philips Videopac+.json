Two players (Pussycat and Hounddog) take turns dropping colored (red or green) discs in an eight-column six-row grid. The object is to place 4 discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.\n\nAn strategic indicator number on the right side of the screen, besides each name, will show the chances of each player to get four discs in a row. The higher the number, the higher the chances. If the number reads 125 it means the player is just one move away from winning. The strategic indicator can be turned off by pressing CLEAR.\n\nWhen playing against the computer, two variations with three skill levels are available:\n\nPlaying against Microcat I, II or III (selected by pressing 1, 2 or 3). Microcat uses a micro-sensor (represented by a µ sign) which will stop over each column calculating its chances. The disc will be dropped where the µ stops. The higher the skill level, the bigger the sensor and calculation times.\n\nPlaying against Microdog I, II or III (selected by pressing 5, 6 or 7) is similar to playing against Microcat (with the skill levels and µ sensor), but the player can also ask for computer assistance on moves. Whenever player's Pussycat appears, pressing 1, 2 or 3, depending on the skill level, will make the PRESS ENTER text appear along the micro sensor. Once pressed, the computer will take over and will continue until the player presses again 0 and ENTER when Pussycat appears.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ueOax7aIA","Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Philips","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22809,"FileName":"25732d32-1f66-43e6-8243-3a9bc0fe412e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22809,"FileName":"b3c301a5-71df-46d4-965d-3c5bc361d204.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22809,"FileName":"7ff67c92-0354-4941-9202-3dabed4346fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22809,"FileName":"b8289369-8447-4f05-9847-07f797335d7e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133833,"Name":"Air Battle","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Air Battle is a flight simulator set in the World War I era.

Once in the air, the player must try to take down the most enemy planes possible, while avoiding hitting friendly planes. The enemy planes have white tail sections while friendly have yellow tail sections.

The player can see incoming planes through a radar in the middle of the panel.\n\nThe player gains points for hitting or taking down enemy planes, but will also be penalized by hitting or taking down friendly planes. There are four levels of difficulty, starting at zero points, 200 points, 500 points and 1000 points. The levels can also be selected directly from the game start, by pressing \"0\", \"1\", \"2\" or \"3\" to start.\n\nThere's a fuel meter at the left of the panel and a ammunition meter at the right.

The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers.\n\nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.\n\nThe game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.\n\nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.\n\nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.\n\nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)\n\nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).\n\nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.\n\nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.\n\nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Philips","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseDate":"1981-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22833,"FileName":"1c38aa44-d6f2-4df9-84f5-0486baf23d94.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22833,"FileName":"2774d04a-5998-4eb6-bac2-29f0190a4438.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22833,"FileName":"32cf53ac-9047-40bc-a84b-63118376736b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22833,"FileName":"c909181a-6815-4cd9-a6ce-56e72bfe6e82.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22834,"Name":"Cosmic Conflict","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Press 1 on the alpha-numeric keyboard.

The spies are in possession of secret information and must try to leave the country with them, by air or by sea. The police officers have to stop their plan. The airport and the port are blocked by the police, and individuals interested in traveling must present a code which only the police knows.\n\nThe main screen represents a town, with U-shaped boxes with numbers from one to nine inside representing buildings. At the beginning of the game, the player controlling the police must define the code which blocks the airport and port (represented by an airplane and a ship). The code must be a word of five letters. As the player enters each letter, he or she must assign a building to store that letter, by entering its number. Once all letters are stored, the game begins. The player controlling the spies must choose one of them and start moving around the town searching for the letters. While moving, the selected spy becomes invisible so the police officer won't see which way the spy takes. At one turn, movement can only be vertical or horizontal, so if the player chooses to move horizontally, he or she will only be able to move vertically in the next turn. At the bottom of the screen, a red character will be shown walking and little green bars will pass him by, telling how many \"spaces\" he has moved. Each turn may last five to 60 seconds, depending on the choice the players made at the beginning of the game (different durations can be set for each player). The turn ends when the time is over or when the player presses a button. The player controlling the police officers chooses one of them and starts moving, trying to catch the spies. When the player thinks the police character is in the same space the spy is, he or she must press the action button. If the spy is really there, he is captured, if not, the player controlling the police officers just ends his or her turn.\n\nThe game ends when the police captures both spies or when one of the spies gets to the airport or the port and enters the correct word.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22932,"FileName":"54a05618-ed1a-4196-927d-da19f6f19002.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22932,"FileName":"772423de-ac2e-4a7d-8358-1ad5762db6d9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22932,"FileName":"f4a8a5b7-cf99-47a2-a26b-0871e05a7c03.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22932,"FileName":"f7064e21-cb0a-4fe6-8700-f96b7a4db8f9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22930,"Name":"Jumping Acrobats","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"P.T.

A Martian space ship is orbiting the earth and a big laser cannon is being built on Earth and it is the player's mission to hold the Martian threat until the laser cannon is complete. To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.\n\nIn Martian Threat the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.\n\nThe game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22927,"FileName":"cf3d54c3-24e7-40a3-b115-2a6615582264.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22927,"FileName":"3394a0ee-37aa-4597-ba46-942aeb299136.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22927,"FileName":"38bd0cbd-53c3-4ce5-9182-357ef393bbfc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22926,"Name":"Mathematician / Echo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Math-A-Magic! is an \"electronic arithmetic teacher\".

Two men appear at the lower right and left of the screen. They are activated by the hand\ncontrols.\n4. The object of the game is to tag as many monkeys as you can with your man - without\ngetting tagged back.\n5. The left hand control maneuvers the man at the lower left of the screen. The right hand control\nactivates the man at the lower right of the screen.\n6. Push the joystick to the right to make your man go to the right. Push the joystick to the left to\nmake your man go to the left.\n7. Push the joystick forward and press the action button to make your man jump up to the next\nhighest level of monkey bars. Push the joystick forward at an angle and press the action button\nto make your man jump on a diagonal. The men can only jump up one level of monkey bars at\na time. One man can give the other a boost. If one jumps on the head of the other, he can reach\nthe next highest level of monkey bars on his next jump.\n8. A man tags a monkey by catching it and pressing the action button. The tagged monkey will\njump away in the direction the joystick is held at the instant the action button is pressed. If you\ncatch a monkey and delay pressing the action button, the monkey will jump away without a\ntag being scored.\n9. Players score one point for every monkey tagged. The game score appears at the lower left of\nthe screen. The highest score in a series of games appears just above the game score. If both\nhand controls are being used, the men play as a team and the score displays their total points.\nYou are not competing with another player - you are competing with the computer.\n10. When a monkey is tagged, it will turn red and try to tag one of the men. If a man is tagged by a\nred monkey, he will freeze in position and is out of the game.\n11. The higher the game score, the longer the monkeys will stay red and the harder it will be for\nthe men to avoid getting caught.\n12. A new game will start automatically when both men have been tagged by red monkeys. The\nmonkey bars will be displayed in a completely different arrangement at the beginning of each\nnew game.\n13. Every game automatically starts at the first skill level. When ten points have been scored, the\ncomputer will automatically change to the next highest skill level to provide greater challenge.\nThe third skill level will be presented when 30 points have been scored. The monkeys stay red\nlonger and are more difficult to evade with every increase in skill level.\n14. If you wish to play at the second skill level before scoring ten points, press the + key once.

The goal is to escape from it through a constantly moving hatch in the attic. His job will be made harder by the ghosts who are still lingering around the house. The player has to climb three floors to reach the attic, and there is one ghost for each floor.\n\nThe ghosts become invisible as they cross the house's walls. While invisible they are harmless, so they have to make themselves visible to catch the visitor. They'll become invisible again if they cross the house walls again. If they catch the visitor, he'll lose one of his lives. But once the visitor has past the ghost's floor, the ghost will be paralyzed and can be caught by the visitor.\n\nBesides the ghosts, other dangers threaten the visitor. A thunderstorm is breaking out and flashes of lightning hit the mansion, creating lightning balls which will roll through the floor the visitor is in. The flashes will also make the invisible ghosts visible while the lightnings strike. Besides, the visitor can't be standing still for too long or a trap door will open and he'll fall through it, losing a life. To make things even more difficult, there will be also a randomly placed obstacle blocking the visitor's way.\n\nThe player starts with three lives and gains one each time he escapes the mansion. As the player grows on points from reaching the attic or capturing the ghosts, the game gets more difficult. The number of obstacles increase and the exit becomes invisible unless the player captures a ghost. In higher difficulty levels catching a ghost won't be enough, as the player will have to also get the house's ground plan, which appears on a chest after he captures a ghost.\n\nThe game can be played by 2 players, one of them controlling the ghosts in the house.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2SKmFUpGqk","Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Philips","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22867,"FileName":"870393d7-9978-4b74-89d3-ff6e613336e5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22867,"FileName":"40e92153-9e70-4b32-a294-37d5ef3a37f2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22867,"FileName":"6680593a-8c94-4ec6-af10-9b4c53ced939.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22867,"FileName":"35c43e6a-91b1-44f2-b770-84f9b95891dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22869,"Name":"Norseman","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Norseman the player controls a Viking warrior trying to defend the magic Golden Viking Helmet.\n\nThe screen shows a courtyard divided in hexagons. The player has to protect the Golden Viking Helmet, which is at the bottom of the screen, from the attack of five different kinds of enemies. Each wave of enemies is composed of 5 of them. The enemies will appear in the top of the screen and will move toward the bottom of the screen; they can only move down (or diagonally down), and once they reach the bottom or the side of the screen they will reappear on the top or the opposite side. The Viking can move in all six directions, and will also reappear on the opposite side whenever he reaches the border. In order to attack, the Viking has to move inside the hexagon the enemy is in before the enemy moves against him first. As the enemies can only move downwards, approaching them from the 3 upper sides is advised.\n\nWhen an enemy dies, the corpse remains in the hexagon, making it impossible to move through it. Well placed corpses can function as a trap for other enemies, as they can only move downwards. The player can also get trapped by surrounding corpses. Once all 5 enemies are dead, a new wave of enemies comes. Each new wave has different enemies, in the following order: giants, octopuses, dragons, skeletons and bats. Once all waves are beaten, the game restarts from the first wave in a greater difficulty, while retaining the player's score. If the player dies or the Golden Viking Helmet is stolen, the game is over.\n\nThe game has 10 variations:\nGame 0: 1 helmet, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\nGame 1: 2 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\nGame 2: 3 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.\nGame 3: Same as game 0, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\nGame 4: As game 1, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\nGame 5: As game 2, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.\nGame 6: 1 helmet, monsters will come from all directions: two monsters moving from top to bottom, and one each from left to right, from right to left and from the bottom to the top.

The galleys can catapult rocks to destroy Archimedes mirror in order to approach the tower without risk. The longer the player holds the button, the farther the rock goes; the rocks can also have its route altered during flight if the player moves the joystick up or down. If the mirror is broken, Archimedes can get a new one by leaving off the right side of the screen. Archimedes can move the mirror up or down to aim the reflection against one of the three approaching galleys. If a galley is hit twice by the sun light it will catch fire, and a new one will appear on the left side of the screen to replace it.

The sun rises in the left and sets in the right, and sometimes a cloud passes by, blocking some sun rays. The game can end in three ways: when the time runs out, when one player scores 99 points or when the three galleys reach the bottom of the tower.

The Keynesians are deeply interested in the 20th Century economic life, and they build more than a trillion different mazes populated by robots representing the economic factors of that time. Starting with $500,000, the players must turn it into a million so they can return for their time, or else be doomed to roam the Keynesian mazes forever!\n\nIn this game, the players play against the Keynesian robots in seven kinds of mazes, called Income, Reward, Investment, Expenses, Thief, Taxes and Inflation. In the first three kinds of mazes, the player must try to catch the robots in order to gain money. In the last four kinds of mazes, the players must run from the robots, as they lose money if caught.\n\nIn both kinds of mazes, a money counter will appear at the bottom of the screen, showing different values of money each time a maze is started. The counter will start to decrease and the players will win (if they catch the robots in the three first kinds of mazes) or lose (if they are caught by the robots in the last four kinds of mazes) the amount of money shown.\n\nThe players' characters are two times taller than the robots, thus sometimes the players must duck to pass through certain portions of the mazes (by pressing the action button). While ducking the players move at 2/3 the normal speed. If they try to pass through a low ceiling portion without ducking, they'll move at half the speed. Touching the walls of a maze will make it harder to move, and touching the opponent player while touching the a will make him lose control.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22917,"FileName":"762d2c61-2dee-40e5-8851-7ac31783ca3e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22917,"FileName":"fac9947d-fb0e-42ee-bb49-0863c49b43ea.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22917,"FileName":"e05abc4c-7531-4bcf-b35c-8653d7908df8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":22917,"FileName":"11e220ae-6e61-4c62-aa53-e5ffb805e598.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22917,"AlternateName":"Prendre l'Argent et Fuir","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":158354,"Name":"Terrahawks","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The player has just attracted the attention of Spyrus the Deathless, the Timelord of Chaos, and his only defense is his Time Machine's laser cannon.

The keyboard overlay is used by the Ringmaster to interface with the computer when your heroes enter the castles choosing what type of labyrinth in which you will do battle. Combat is controlled by using the computer joysticks.\n\nThere are four heroes: a warrior with a magic sword, a wizard with various spells, a changeling who can become invisible and a phantom who can walk through and hide in walls. The four labyrinths are dungeons, infernoes, crystal caverns and shifting halls. The four monsters are orcs, bloodthirsts (bats), tyrantulus (spiders) and dragons.\n\nGameplay pits the Ringmaster against up to four players. The Ringmaster controls the game by hiding the rings, choosing the dungeons and can even enter into combat. Before the game starts the hero players decide how many turns it will take to complete the quest for the ten rings either 50, 75 or 100 turns. Turns are based on castle visits and combat and if you don't complete your quest within the amount of turns you choose you lose. The hero players can start from any designated starting point on the game board and begin their quest for the rings.","MaxPlayers":"5","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUPoXqqWAeM","Platform":"Philips Videopac+","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Ed Averett","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171414,"FileName":"104fef61-0cdc-4093-81ce-f46960f12cc8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"FileName":"3da769eb-80e2-485b-a788-0ac9ae0e0fe5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171414,"FileName":"c7ed0dda-7c60-43a5-b3c4-287c6fc451d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"La Quête des Anneaux","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Speurtocht naar de Ringen","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Sormusten Etsintä","Region":"Finland"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"La búsqueda de los Anillos","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Jakten På De Magiska Ringarna","Region":"Sweden"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Jagten på Ringene","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Em Busca dos Anéis Perdidos","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Die Suche Nach Den Ringen","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":171414,"AlternateName":"Caccia al Tesoro","Region":"Italy"}]},{"DatabaseID":22891,"Name":"Trans American Rally","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Trans American Rally the object is to cover as large a distance as possible with the available fuel.
