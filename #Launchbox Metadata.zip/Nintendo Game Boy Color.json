Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Tiertex Design Studios","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"257ff572-9925-4fd5-83ff-b817cf6b1229.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"abf7c914-bf23-47fe-8fac-aab2bf3667f4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"e7288052-e7de-4478-bfe0-af8450fa163b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"de8964b3-8262-4470-9e81-7c731bf7d663.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"18f81163-c25a-439c-9e10-94a0df083c57.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"cf8b7233-d567-43ac-84df-987365c1d0a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"74044229-e9e5-477f-a8d7-408ac7b49ac3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"5517c7c9-7fc1-47e3-9f97-421074ed30e9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"37709a6e-6264-43ee-a53b-9e4697ab851b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"daa6b8d8-40b0-4eef-b8b9-d731b22d5805.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"dbfbb04e-fc6a-4bea-9371-0884d19ed6ed.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"858a051c-cfa0-4f50-8d38-b2a65a307af2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"6240e09d-8eb1-4a3f-ac14-9ecb7e1ec186.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8600,"FileName":"f1948b34-cd05-4449-90e3-515b00fa0729.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8600,"AlternateName":"Bichos: Una Aventura en Miniatura","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":17449,"Name":"Action Man: Search for Base X","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Alex \"Action Man\" Mann makes a stop over onto the Game Boy Color where once again he must stop the world from falling into the clutches of the evil Dr. X.

Like that game, it is a simplified adaptation of a PC game (Army Men II) to the Game Boy Color.\n\nThe game is very similar to its predecessor. Players control green army soldier Sarge through a number of missions, with the goal usually being to destroy a number of tan army enemies. The missions are organized into two campaigns (Field and Assault), each consisting of three to four maps with three to five missions each, for a total of 31 missions in the game, with a boot camp training mission also available. Some of the maps are directly based on those in Army Men II, others have been newly designed. Unlike in Army Men II, all missions take place in the \"real\" world, where the plastic toy soldiers find themselves in environments like (relative to their size) huge gardens, kitchens or garages.\n\nGameplay is unchanged from the predecessor. Seen from a top-down perspective, players control only Sarge, without a support squad as seen in the PC game. Sarge can pick up various weapons like flamethrowers, mortars and grenades in addition to his standard gun with unlimited ammo, but can carry only three items total. It is again also possible to enter and use vehicles. An overview map of the level shows both Sarge's and the enemies' positions.\n\nThe game introduces a two-player mode via link cable, with two game modes: deathmatch and capture-the-flag.

Their goal is to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.\n\nThis title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the \"Instant Fun\" option. They vary from a \"Memory\" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as \"Throw a Roman Mini Game\".\n\nBoth Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn_ratQ4Msw","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Rebellion Developments Ltd.","Publisher":"Infogrames Europe SA","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"ce884fb0-48ed-4f99-ab96-60c2c4251107.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"83e51894-dec1-4c8a-8b55-2cba6119fadf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"00940a04-4ca7-42d9-ad75-0a26a2d686c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"ce4234fa-d723-42cb-980b-c4196505fb8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"5aeea7ee-ef22-4728-88e7-38c90a588ebd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"9ac110ad-072a-4e20-85aa-b8e0848783d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"92ed22b2-c382-46d7-9ec5-5f3aea92c48e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"fa5985dd-f592-43fe-b022-2c6088c24e0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"249cd498-f9e3-443b-bbf1-e03607798d4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"8075ac4c-cdd4-484d-af70-5bf4b578289a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"cc788fa0-daf1-4422-8aa7-07d77cc21996.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"FileName":"7d205ea9-8f07-461a-a148-42df5737b2da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":24358,"AlternateName":"Asterix: Search for Dogmatix","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24358,"AlternateName":"Astérix: Auf der Suche nach Idefix","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":24358,"AlternateName":"Asterix: Sur la Trace D'Idefix","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":25445,"Name":"Asteroids","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your spaceship is trapped in a deadly asteroid belt.

BABE AND FRIENDS, a single-player puzzle game for Game Boy Color, has the little porcine hero guiding his herd through 40 levels that span such locations as the farm, the airport, and the city. In each level there is a checkered flag, to which Babe must take a herd. The sheep aren't very good at finding their own paths, so Babe has to walk them through every step of the way. Clear obstacles, set up roadblocks to make detours, and generally do what you have to in order to make a safe route for the sheep. Watch out for obstructions such as carts in the airport and rushing rivers on the farm. Detailed still-screens of all of Babe's friends appear between the levels to move the story along. A password save system is included if you need to take a break from the brain-bending action. Can Babe save the day once again?","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Aqua Pacific","Publisher":"Crave","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"3b7134e2-060f-4c02-a747-3cb860a42bf9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"dd271952-8380-45b3-bc38-fb9d02747bd3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"df4f06a5-c60f-4084-a88b-a661d9172bd8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"be0edfa9-74a5-4a1b-828d-d32a5429cf1b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"efc64474-94fb-448c-82ae-903ca00743f9.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"113665d0-08cb-4096-9820-60189fbaa7ff.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"4b2ebfee-03e2-4d48-9c5b-7f2d350fe629.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"c6dafbbf-9db6-4b87-a8ab-3945158fe568.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21884,"FileName":"481b11c8-281e-4287-9c7f-5b9b7aaa56b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33068,"Name":"Baby Felix: Halloween","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Baby Felix Halloween is a platformer developed by Bit Managers and published by Light & Shadow Productions for the Game Boy Color platform.

He somehow, though, breaks a chip supposedly used to control him, and he escapes Go's laboratory as well as destroying it, while he now realizes that he is now bipedal and can speak human language. He comes to terms with his predicament, while maintaining his lifestyle as an average housecat. However, Go feels that Kuro is ungrateful to him, and he and the Nyan-Nyan Army, including the most well-known Mi, set out to find and kill him, though they eventually surrender and decide to live a more peaceful life.\n\nOften, Kuro will save his owners and the city from trouble. He has multiple adversaries, including Go's Nyan-Nyan Army. Dr. Go and Mi help Kuro out in the toughest situations. Throughout the course of the series, there are phantasmal and extraordinary predicaments that Kuro and his friends must solve.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXNuVzXedHk","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2000-03-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"1897f65e-8a85-4751-891d-6e3a66b114f9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"1f8d9ea0-013c-4845-af96-4b0df83ef93c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"9200d934-2cab-4a05-966d-bdfc38ba5874.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"09da2cba-51b6-4416-bce7-f8b7f8905c1a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"56a3dd94-c030-4cef-ad13-eb14b0af5bdc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"774a4c93-125c-466b-9fdc-9bb50fa1e0a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167141,"FileName":"bc642435-4169-4b39-8663-80a2b95125eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167334,"Name":"Daa!

If it is, the game displays a screen showing a Game Boy Color sending an infrared signal to a Furby. If you point the Game Boy Color's infrared port at any Adult Furby and press A while on this screen, it will fart if the game was beaten on easy, play hide and seek or yawn if the song was beaten on medium, and dance if it was beaten on hard.

It was released exclusively in German-speaking regions, where the characters are very popular, and is thus only available with German on-screen text; as the game is not very text-heavy, however, it can be played without understanding the language.\n\nThe game is a relatively simple side-scrolling platformer. It stars the anthropomorphic hippopotamus Max Mutig (\"Max Courageous\"), who sets out on a journey to lift the secret around his home island's volcano, which has recently become active again and is causing destruction. In order to do so, he must venture through six areas, consisting of three levels each and filled with various enemies and hazards, which must be avoided or eliminated by various means, as well as fire, which can be doused by spitting water at it.

The working title during the game's development was Game Boy Wars Pocket Tactics during development.[1]\n\nThe gameplay of Game Boy Wars 3 is a departure from the previous Game Boy Wars titles, being modeled after the Nectaris series of war simulators that were also produced by Hudson. For example, indirect attack units can now move and attack at the same time in one turn. In contrast to the previous Game Boy Wars titles, having the required fund is not enough to produce certain units. The player must provide construction materials to the factories and cities as well. To do that, the player must deploy construction units to these sites and built the materials. These construction units can be used to cut down trees and create roads.\n\nGame Boy Wars 3 features a Beginner Mode, which gives the player a 16-part tutorial on how to play the game, as well as a Standard Mode in which the player can fight against the CPU or another player in one of 60 maps. There's also a Campaign Mode in which the player must fight through over 45 different maps that are dictated by a storyline, which has several branching points determined by the player's performance. A feature exclusive in the Campaign Mode is the ability to redeploy surviving units from a previous battle into the next one. Units gain experience points through combat, allowing them to be promoted from one of five ranks (D, C, B, A, and S), increasing their strength. Units who reach an S rank can be transformed into a new type of unit.\n\nOn release, Famitsu magazine scored Game Boy Wars 3 a 31 out of 40.[1]","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":"2001-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19081,"FileName":"e838f8bb-753f-49ca-83d8-69c9b5e3c831.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19081,"FileName":"240c98c6-64b9-4c63-a619-0a90069b6e0b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19081,"FileName":"49299880-6daf-4203-828a-99133c7ab95f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19081,"FileName":"e5f2d516-f671-4dd2-aba0-f84956311720.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":19081,"FileName":"19fcba40-f85e-4f3c-96c6-3460e5e89555.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":140821,"Name":"Game Conveni 21","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Game Conveni 21 is a Strategy game, published by Starfish, which was released in Japan in 2000.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Starfish","Publisher":"Starfish","ReleaseDate":"2000-05-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":140821,"FileName":"1c3718da-bf83-4f87-9541-e82975eb5c4f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140821,"FileName":"e3d9b210-98fb-49f9-acab-349e5b0b6782.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140821,"FileName":"c05c8ff4-7765-4b1c-b313-fade291f2f60.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":140821,"FileName":"d3cca769-0971-4f27-8d08-1f7a3b568b37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":105249,"Name":"Ganbare Goemon: Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ganbare Goemon: Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! is an Action game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2000.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":105249,"FileName":"95929f13-49d6-4c4f-b7c5-522e1b938495.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105249,"FileName":"cd31955d-7519-4199-8847-80c1cfd450eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105249,"FileName":"a02f80be-fd4e-4b57-87a3-73b7c031e9d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105249,"FileName":"3ce91620-fff3-4d67-b251-3da41d09efee.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105249,"FileName":"2f58e076-55d8-4a5c-80b4-02bbb816c042.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105249,"FileName":"317bf858-3df7-4eb5-bae2-f777360fb8ce.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":105249,"AlternateName":"Ganbare Goemon: Seikuushi Dynamites Arawaru!!","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105249,"AlternateName":"Ganbare Goemon: Seikuushi Dynamites Arawaru!!","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":167206,"Name":"Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke Dōchū Tobidase Nabe-Bugyō!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ganbare Goemon - Mononoke Douchuu Tobidase Nabebugyou!

Every table also has a special quest which rewards many points, e.g. collecting (i.e. bumping into) rockets and then hitting a special target.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Tarantula Studios","Publisher":"Starfish","ReleaseDate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"d4dded99-e978-4b4f-89ad-179835faf682.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"ec7a9dd2-e068-4a33-b441-adea0e7b9d56.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"e57d471c-7f62-4bb9-9057-47df23916031.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"1643cdb9-7bf4-4f73-bffc-ff257c16e620.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"b2e9e772-672d-4661-b8d7-667d326a499c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"6e0f0945-96cf-429a-aba1-a26758aee1d6.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"f5cd3eb2-0e6f-4dab-8e85-f05219f3c183.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17466,"FileName":"d22e62e1-5741-4032-a5a8-c53c4b708058.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167419,"Name":"Honkaku Hanafuda GB","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsd6lDwVdLU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Altron","ReleaseDate":"2000-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167419,"FileName":"8897f920-e751-43d4-9e02-2a82f0199bdd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167419,"FileName":"577c01e6-703c-44eb-9afc-dab12ec593f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167420,"Name":"Honkaku Shougi: Shougi Ou","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EASl3y1wq64","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Culture Brain","ReleaseDate":"2000-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167420,"FileName":"caa7a982-c9d1-4cf4-b7f3-14f0207c45b5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167420,"FileName":"d943b91b-7010-40c4-bf6f-27e99ae7d15e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167420,"FileName":"2495d95c-484f-4b27-97d4-de5833518a81.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167418,"Name":"Honkaku Taisen Shougi Ayumu","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A shogi game for Game Boy Color from Culture Brain.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxUf6XWmhq8","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Culture Brain","Publisher":"Culture Brain","ReleaseDate":"2000-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167418,"FileName":"0e725f59-170d-4180-9745-83a773d27bd4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167418,"FileName":"a715b166-7e39-48c6-8a9e-894f185e4f74.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167418,"FileName":"7cec3753-cb0e-44a3-94ef-78cd0916ff7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167418,"FileName":"e5283bf9-40e8-4b70-91f6-873435e03412.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167421,"Name":"Honkaku Yonin Uchi Mahjong: Mahjong Ou ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Four player mahjong game for one human player.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McusfRSN3uU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Warashi","ReleaseDate":"1999-02-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167421,"FileName":"aae7d37c-5c82-4247-a0f2-021395c385d2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167421,"FileName":"555579a8-c371-4631-befd-1f8c05e896c5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167421,"FileName":"aeb0f941-82f3-46db-ab70-1361c4b398d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167421,"FileName":"98f656ed-d24a-4738-bcc6-0122d22073c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21915,"Name":"Hot Wheels: Stunt Track Driver","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The little die-cast cars from Matchbox make their way to the Game Boy Color with HOT WHEELS STUNT TRACK DRIVER.

Each area has three stages to complete, with a boss at the end of every third stage, and can be revisited after completion.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Sintax","Publisher":"sintax","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183080,"FileName":"6862096a-e8ad-4ec9-a656-3ecf8b6944d0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183080,"FileName":"19284dd1-3aaa-4ff4-8a13-f9e6c331b329.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183080,"FileName":"c098e17e-c260-4a9c-9415-aeb07ff5339c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183080,"AlternateName":"Ice Age II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":167423,"Name":"Ide Yousuke no Mahjong Kyoushitsu GB","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwSneLWFasU","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Board Game","Developer":"Athena Co.","Publisher":"Athena","ReleaseDate":"2000-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167423,"FileName":"d43acf9e-553c-4fb5-b653-dc803ddbcf8a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167423,"FileName":"550364d6-a0a9-4e06-81ab-b7444eb8590f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167423,"FileName":"b26d7692-6206-49a0-aeff-abb5b40cd9d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167423,"FileName":"fc4b4b98-a26f-4c61-81a3-377c11f75b8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22004,"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Communists are trying to reassemble a machine that will open the door to a parallel universe.

Despite its true blue retro heritage and troubled development history, Infinity is a bit more than a time capsule curio – it brings some of its interesting new ideas and twists on the conventions of the time and is worth a play to see into the mists of what could have been.\n\nWhile pretty much blatantly a derivative of classic JRPGs, Infinity still had a few surprises in store. Like all good JRPGs, early on you, the stoic knight type, are issued a quest by the king that you won’t refuse.\n\nThe game makes no attempt to hide the fact that you’re pretty much screwed over into doing a task for a megalomaniacal king that you have no love for. Charmed, I’m sure. Your first companion isn’t a plucky young girl or mysterious knight, either, but rather a greedy prick who refuses to do shit for you until he gets a fat paycheck first.\n\nDeveloped by a group of 17 year olds back in 2000, Infinity is clearly a passion project from impressionable youths who wanted to make the dream RPG. The project initially had interest from a publisher – which is impressive for a group of teenagers before the internet era. Alas, its timing was ill-fated thanks to the untimely release of the Gameboy Advance; interest in releasing a Gameboy Color game diminished and the project eventually dropped. Decades later, the band got back together again and decided to release the game itself plus the source code to the public.\n\nInfinity’s combat isn't perfect, and is far too frequent, but it does have a few interesting ideas. Combat is semi-tactical, allowing you to position your characters (but only one step at a time), which adds some welcome depth to combat. It’s reminiscent, albeit simpler, than the combat of Treasure Hunter G, or perhaps an imaginary version of Chrono Trigger‘s battles where you could actually have some control over where your characters stood.\n\nThere’s the usual variety of special and elemental attacks, from fireballs to waves of water, and, thankfully, it all animates fast enough so as not to drag on too long. Battles also tend to start in relatively close quarters too, meaning you don’t have to spend multiple turns positioning, and can usually get right into it. This gives the frequent battles a decent pace – something that can otherwise be the death knell of many a JRPG (retro or otherwise).\n\nThere are some oddities with the combat, though. For one thing, it’s not at all immediately obvious that you can move in battle. This is because although the normal maps and battle areas look like a standard overhead view common to games of the era, it’s actually all treated like an isometric view, meaning you can only initiate a move by holding diagonal directions or.. up and down… but not left nor right – why? Who knows, but it’s all a bit wonky and unintuitive, at least until you realize what’s going on.\n\nThe developers, Afinix Software, are currently toying with the idea of reviewing the project. They estimate that Infinity’s source code is around 90% complete, and said that if they don’t finish the game anytime soon, someone else can.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Affinix Software","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"4967e7df-11d8-4caa-a2e2-12b65368e7f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"303f14ee-a252-4e9b-9436-e7a3f3b0fdc0.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"1a928605-d5c7-40a2-9169-21378a482e03.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"d90c5a07-4b14-4409-9f20-cc708f8b0942.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"058bf527-ab89-4d85-b087-8967cd9e60e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"8fefa195-6a97-4cc3-a59e-cd89a8d0385f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"66072040-90ad-4273-a2a7-dd232385a9c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"1deaa1bd-7c71-41b7-a146-bb7b459384c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":137589,"FileName":"13066758-82c2-4f1e-8440-eb66e52538bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22005,"Name":"Inspector Gadget: Operation Madkactus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The evil Dr. Claw is about to unleash the deadly MadKactus virus on the world, and it's up to Inspector Gadget to stop him.

Compared to the rest of the Beyblade franchise, this game represents some unique ideas and concepts that were never carried on into the main Beyblade series itself. It bears more of a resemblance to Pokémon in style and is the only game within the Beyblade franchise which is a true \"J-RPG\" style. The player goes around the storyline collecting bits and beyblade parts while fighting enemies and progressing throught the game.\n\nEach bit-beast has its own unique attack (though some do nothing until their bits upgrade themselves to their final form) and like Pokémon certain ones also evolve when the bits reach a certain experience (there are 3 stages like Pokemon).\n\nAt the start of the game, there are limited things Tyson can do. After getting the rank of \"C\", the player is given TP, the currency of the game allowing them to purchase items, after winning battles TP is now also awarded not just experience for the Bits. The WBA buildings also become available, here you can exchange stores Beyblades, connect to other players or look at each buildings list of trades.\n\nEach bit also has a typing which contributes a little bit of the battle against other types, much like in pokemon. The types include fire, devil, fighting, rock, electricity,\n\nTyson has also a \"Power meter\" powered by \"POW\" that goes down over time, requiring him to purchase items to restore it. This represents strain on his arms. If the meter runs dry, he faints and returns to his home of origins.

At John Romero's request, the title was adapted to the platform as a top-down dungeon crawler, in the style of early Zelda games such as the NES original and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Ion Storm","Publisher":"Kemco","ReleaseDate":"2000-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"1bdf61d1-ddb6-4132-9119-23fb893c0d60.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"2f43bc54-ad67-4921-943a-66825ed3b9cc.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"8bcf8bd0-e366-40ad-bffb-b487efb49a03.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"46d8312f-1219-4e89-b316-495b7a1acfa7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"823bc587-ac32-4557-8a6a-28094599982e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"93088637-b8ac-48a2-9922-1a3b41dca2f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"32beaf3a-b98e-46fd-a397-493f9762ac3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"da6589f6-914b-46a0-87c8-0bf62504d7aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"a6e6a9b7-b06a-4ae6-998d-988296b67289.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"26ae6f23-8601-4e6d-aca8-2481d3825f89.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"f40102e2-cc15-4e9d-b085-20a67531762e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"63ee2fe8-eaa2-443a-bbb5-aa4312953a42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8611,"FileName":"e07afa9b-5c71-4823-8e7d-11f8f06c6b57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8611,"AlternateName":"Daikatana GB","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8611,"AlternateName":"Daikatana","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":167433,"Name":"Joryuu Janshi ni Chousen GB: Watashi-tachi ni Chousen Shitene!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTtKGAUudzc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Culture Brain","Publisher":"Culture Brain","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167433,"FileName":"f27b8221-aeeb-4703-9cde-14985fc0ed3e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167433,"FileName":"e13d832a-7a07-4694-a82c-b4f2bb54ec25.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Korea"},{"DatabaseID":167433,"FileName":"77cbe52f-f695-44d9-863a-c5c056c36c25.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22008,"Name":"JumpStart: Dino Adventure Field Trip","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"JumpStart: Dino Adventure Field Trip is an Action game, developed by Digital Illusions and published by Knowledge Adventure Inc., which was released in 2001.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Education","Developer":"Digital Illusions","Publisher":"Knowledge Adventure Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2001-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22008,"FileName":"c296859e-145d-4f9f-95be-233b16a5197e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22008,"FileName":"27720847-afcf-411c-943e-e4eabb991c98.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22008,"FileName":"44a27a1e-dafc-4015-bd7c-fb328ae271ad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22008,"FileName":"9b42becd-ba6c-45e2-af1a-4a52a0455e2e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22008,"FileName":"fcca9917-e64b-4af9-9052-0019807473bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22008,"FileName":"65294ad6-ba59-45b9-bbcc-b0b8c4baa1a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132457,"Name":"Jurassic Boy 2","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":"Jurassic Boy 2, known as Chao Yin Su Xun Meng Long (超音速迅猛龍, literally Supersonic Raptor) in Chinese, is a clone of Sonic the Hedgehog made and released by Sachen.

Ringside commentary is provided via voice samples of Mills Lane.\n\nGame modes include Slugfest, Career and Vs Mode (via link cable). In Slugfest mode, players select one of the legends and take on the other nine in a ladder of matches. In Career mode, players create their own boxer by picking nickname and weight and setting stats from a point pool. The career then progresses through a variety of divisions with fights against smaller opponents, with the hope of progressing far enough to take on the champions. Between matches, stats can be increased through training sessions. Progress is saved via passwords.\n\nThe fights are displayed in a 2D scrolling view of the ring, with the fighters drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of punches by combining the A, B and Start buttons with the D-Pad.

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\n\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhB2ktEyTsk","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"9f6d8401-0471-458a-9806-6894deaacf43.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"43972a44-ae69-477b-b120-c55df216461a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"bb4c8072-89a5-4c1f-a06b-8b046cf903ef.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"4fab7d44-12ae-43ad-91ad-83c87cbed487.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"034abe2d-0fd2-44f6-9b6b-25f380538509.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"6632c8a1-8e64-45c4-a110-9dcbbace833e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"5d3ee81b-8892-40ac-b055-ed953e557e10.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"e3f7b4ac-a338-4ba0-8846-2ef65b160a88.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"6b77930e-9579-4d3c-a110-7ffa8d7544dc.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"7a288452-2eda-4d03-ba81-f7a259bbef47.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"4d038849-25a8-41cd-9474-f31bcc7de3b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8802,"FileName":"25da2e78-5e2f-4b71-b36f-18f75c7aedcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8802,"AlternateName":"Bakusou Senki Metal Walker GB: Koutetsu no Yuujou","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":167479,"Name":"Metamode","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAKDy50ewjA","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":"2000-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167479,"FileName":"787e34dd-d906-43e8-9c43-2314fae4efff.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167479,"FileName":"f494090b-e82b-4a2f-8258-68c1f742ac94.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167479,"FileName":"9aff15fd-f612-41d8-bf6d-9c218bbf1bcf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21845,"Name":"Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The thrills and excitement of international women's soccer comes to the Game Boy Color with MIA HAMM SOCCER SHOOTOUT.

A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.\n\nSpring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.\n\nLineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.\n\nFinty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.\n\nColor Collision. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time. The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.\n\nRat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Conspiracy Entertainment","Publisher":"Classified Games","ReleaseDate":"2000-10-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"f5d4cd1c-19c2-4864-b6cd-44e12327ec4c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"34da89b5-20f5-4ed2-a567-4a5ef5cc4487.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"0937496e-72d9-4c9c-b013-4d195f3e8f26.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"407e42a2-c185-4394-ac30-4a276431cfd6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"69a1607a-3d82-405c-b0b9-068be02a1ad3.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"ffc84079-5d97-4799-a76c-90fd36e27da0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"fb77459a-512e-41c8-8b38-b6456491a388.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"6cce5712-0e59-4cbd-9197-97fc09542cfb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"861ad09a-65d0-4dc2-ac70-a79623dbf6b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"8cea8634-1b11-4dc3-ac6d-803a46054366.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"2753d0a4-6bbd-49e9-b16f-e35b3d5fadff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"34c33069-5ee9-44d4-aeb7-9d87f36a1c20.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"6f31eaad-3259-4def-80f0-4d57f54ca5c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"283a4aa4-0f94-4380-8b57-f70e48cdc57a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"7081e38f-ea2a-4c38-881c-414907d0b559.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"d1f9a72a-5507-43f6-b890-1f05223d5359.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"aa7abe1b-accb-4125-bb94-98885b0a172b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"cfae9b8d-0f97-4cda-a87f-9ebbef605f26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"e4d52d66-7c59-4296-9d0b-a3fd56891a7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"FileName":"d934b5dd-12a4-4724-b64c-3e9b9c349fc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":21959,"AlternateName":"Microsoft: The 6-in-1 Puzzle Collection Entertainment Pack","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21959,"AlternateName":"Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":21960,"Name":"Microsoft: The Best of Entertainment Pack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Microsoft: The Best of Entertainment Pack is a Puzzle game, developed by Microsoft , Cryo Interactive and Saffire Corporation and published by Classified Games, which was released in 2001.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"Microsoft","Publisher":"Microsoft Home","ReleaseDate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":21960,"FileName":"e2f2defe-d1b9-464f-be10-dfc19a605d8f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21960,"FileName":"6fcf4a09-b589-43c1-880d-9a366ffaf5ce.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":21960,"FileName":"4e587a2a-8925-4084-a63b-cf9a2705bfac.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21960,"FileName":"77a41f7b-04db-4e3e-a75a-d5baa8203192.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21960,"FileName":"80c6e75a-77bb-4cee-811a-501e89186bdf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":21960,"FileName":"fb2775c8-477e-494b-a69c-8331fe8be7d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22030,"Name":"Millennium Winter Sports","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"MILLENNIUM WINTER SPORTS allows you to experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in eight winter sports.

This included games relevant to the Mario series, such as Mobile Golf and the Japanese version of Mario Kart: Super Circuit.\n\nThe Mobile Trainer's main purpose was as operation software for configuring the Game Boy Color with the user's mobile phone.

People prayed to God for help, and God created new life forms. However, new life forms brought new troubles, so God became exasperated and sealed them in \"disc stones\". Many years have passed since then and God entrusted the humans with the secret of \"disc stones\". Today people still continue searching for these missing \"disc stones\" to unlock the lifeforms within. In the anime, the monsters were created by scientists.\nIt is said that the \"disc stones\" are almost impossible to find among the ancient ruins. It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone.

The trailer park in question is inhabited by an eclectic bunch of oddball residents and seems to be led by an elusive character called Bill. After an unsuccessful attempt at delivering the pizza you’re keen to leave, but there’s a mysterious girl that you’d like to rescue from this nightmarish place first.\n\nTaking around 15 minutes to play through, it’s an excellent little horror game with a very unsettling atmosphere and an intriguing story that contains some great twists. The pixel artwork is particularly impressive, with each of the residents rendered in all their grotesque beauty. It does a great job of allowing you to get to know the personalities of each resident and getting to know them as people, which makes the ending that much more poignant. Highly recommended.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7E_a0gKQmc","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Horror","Developer":"Ben Jelter","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197459,"FileName":"4a82a3d2-f768-4ce5-b0bb-a26894160097.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176511,"Name":"Othello Millennium","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Othello Millennium is a board game developed by Tomcat System and published by Tsukuda Original for the Game Boy Color platform.

Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.\n\nThis is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.\n\nBe careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"15f14a59-a8ea-4fed-9acd-38516ed87fd3.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"6fb6b59e-fc42-4f3a-a089-ef620412fa46.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"64fd4b73-bc69-4677-9f63-ab60633e427e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"0a2e4412-a3c3-42a8-b9d4-59335a6332ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"61b171cb-a97e-41ab-8ed8-6cd3e3a7ab95.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"e9e1935d-c740-46f0-a8f4-62788844bde3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"a6c9338a-6e19-42e7-b353-7e8a9d766264.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"6068581a-fc2a-40f4-9952-4a20a7f003fe.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"10fda590-4633-48bf-82d5-0f6392a916d9.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"1a64dec2-30d7-44b9-a660-6faf76b0192b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8638,"FileName":"07bcf42d-30c6-4b7a-a67d-5f80b92aca71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":21830,"Name":"Pocket Bowling","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The action and excitement of using a big ball to knock down white pins comes to the Game Boy Color with POCKET BOWLING.

As the blob-like \"puyos\" start falling in your play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several \"garbage\" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.\n\nNew for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage.

It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.\n\nLike the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed \"likely\" by website IGN in 2001, the game has not been made available outside Japan.

As a Gen I spinoff game, the game features sprites of all 150 Pokémon available in Pokémon Red/Green/Blue. The game was planned to be compatible with Game Boy Printer, with the sprites being printable by being viewed on the in-game Pokédex.\n\nThe game is divided into 11 levels, each one featuring 15 puzzles (with the final one being locked). Once 8 puzzles are completed (halfway the level), the 15th puzzle would be unlocked. A perfect completion of each puzzle occurs by solving the puzzle within the time limit determined to it, with a Master Ball as the reward; otherwise, a normal Poké Ball would be awarded.\n\nThere is a variety of themes (music / border) assigned to certain Pokémon, which appears as Ash's partner in the level select map.

Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.\n\n\"Evolution Mode,\" when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up.

Some Pokémon, like Houndour, Murkrow, and Misdreavus, are available at sensible locations in Johto without having to wait for Kanto.\n• Added: Leafeon, Glaceon, Sylveon, Togekiss, Weavile, Honchkrow, Mismagius, Electivire, Magmortar, Magnezone, Tangrowth, Rhyperior, Porygon-Z, Yanmega, Gliscor, Mamoswine, and Munchlax.\n• Removed: Spearow, Fearow, Lickitung, Goldeen, Seaking, Hoppip, Skiploom, Jumpluff, Shuckle, Aipom, Stantler, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Smoochum, and Delibird. (I miss them too. :( )\n• New evolution methods work, like Eevee evolving into Glaceon near Ice Rock, or Yanma evolving into Yanmega when knowing AncientPower.\n• Item trade evolutions (like Seadra holding a Dragon Scale) now evolve by leveling up while holding the item.\n• Machoke, Graveler, Haunter, and Kadabra evolve by having sufficient stat exp in Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special respectively (five Protein, Iron, Carbos, or Calcium is enough).\n• Magneton evolves into Magnezone near the Lodestone in Rock Tunnel.\nMoves:\n• Added: Aerial Ace, Air Slash, Aqua Tail, Astonish, Avalanche, Bug Buzz, Bulk Up, Bullet Punch, Calm Mind, Dark Pulse, DazzlinGleam, Disarm Voice, Dragon Claw, Dragon Dance, Dragon Pulse, Drain Kiss, Earth Power, Energy Ball, Extrasensory, Fairy Wind, Flare Blitz, Flash Cannon, Focus Blast, Gunk Shot, Hail, Hex, Hone Claws, Hurricane, Hyper Voice, Ice Shard, Icicle Crash, Iron Head, Metal Sound, Moonblast, Nasty Plot, Night Slash, Play Rough, Poison Jab, Power Gem, Psystrike, Seed Bomb, Shadow Claw, Stone Edge, Water Pulse, Wild Charge, Will-O-Wisp, X-Scissor, and Zen Headbutt.\n• Removed: Acid Armor, Amnesia, Barrage, Beat Up, Bide, Bind, Bone Club, Bone Rush, Bubble, Clamp, Comet Punch, Constrict, Conversion2, Cotton Spore, Detect, Fissure, Frustration, Guillotine, Horn Drill, Jump Kick, Kinesis, Lovely Kiss, Meditate, Mega Kick, Mega Punch, Mimic, Mind Reader, Mirror Move, Poison Gas, Powder Snow, Present, Psych Up, Psywave, Razor Wind, Rolling Kick, Sharpen, Skull Bash, Smog, Snore, Spider Web, Spite, Sweet Scent, Synthesis, Tail Whip, Vice Grip, and Withdraw.\n• Learnsets have been updated close to Gen VI, with missing moves replaced by similar, egg, TM, or event-exclusive moves.\nBattle mechanics:\n• The Fairy type, with the Pink Bow as its type-enhancing item.\n• Type chart, base stats, and move attributes all updated to Gen VI.\n• Physical/Special/Status split.\n• Natures (determined from DVs since personality values don't exist in Gen II) thanks to FredrIQ.\n• Gain experience from catching Pokémon.\n• Play low-pitched cries when a player or foe Pokémon faints.\n• Money loss formula from Gen V.\n• Shiny Pokémon now have an odd Attack DV, 2, 3, 7, or 11 Defense, 5 or 13 Speed, and a perfect 15 Special; so 1 in 1,024 Pokémon is shiny.\n• Type-enhancing items raise by 20%, not 10%.\n• Many battle mechanics have been updated to Gen VI, but not all. (For example, Waterfall has a 20% flinch chance, but sound-based moves don't bypass Substitute. Yet.)\n• Wild Pokémon have more common held items (50% chance for a common one and 5% for a rare one). Giving an Amulet Coin to your lead Pokémon increases this to 60% and 10%.\nOverworld mechanics:\n• Hold B to use Running Shoes, or turn on the Option to always use them.\n• Unlimited-use TMs.\n• Continuous Repel system.\n• Cure poison when it reaches 1 HP outside a battle.\n• Eggs hatch at level 1.\n• Trees randomly give 1, 2, or 3 Berries.\n• Surf at Bicycle/Running Shoes speed.\n• Maximum $9,999,999 money and 50,000 coins.\n• Maximum 30 items and 16 Balls in your bag pocket.\n• Bill calls to switch boxes when one is full.\nNuzlocke mode:\n• Available in the Option menu at any time.\n• A fainted Pokémon can't be revived, by items, Pokémon Centers, or events. The only exception is your first rival battle, when you just have your starter.\n• You can only catch the first Pokémon you encounter in a new location. \"Location\" is defined with the Town Map mechanics, so Sprout Tower is separate from Violet City, but multiple floors of Union Cave or multiple sections of the Safari Zone count as one location. And nothing is counted until you receive your first five Poké Balls.\n• Every Pokémon gets a nickname, no asking whether you want to or not. Of course, you can cancel out to give the default name.\n• The dupes clause is in effect. If you've caught a Pidgey and encounter one on a new route, it won't count unless you catch it.\n• The shiny clause is also in effect. Shinies can always be caught.\n• Gift Pokémon do not count as encounters. Static encounters like Sudowoodo, Snorlax, and Suicune do.\nMaps:\n• Restored locations from R/B/Y and HG/SS: Viridian Forest, Pewter Museum, Celadon Hotel, Silph Co., Pokémon Mansion, Seafoam Islands, Cerulean Cave, Goldenrod PokéCom Center, and Bellchime Trail.\n• Original locations, including Cinnabar Volcano, a new floor of Rock Tunnel, Cherrygrove Bay, Goldenrod Harbor, Route 35 Coast, the Ecruteak Shrine from Pokémon Christmas, custom-designed PokéWalker routes, and others.\n• Decorative features added to cities and routes, often from HG/SS.\n• HG/SS-style Town Map.\nEvents:\n• Team Rocket has another plan to thwart.\n• Random Wonder Trades in the Goldenrod PokéCom Center, including random held items and original trainers.\n• Catching all 26 Unown is worthwhile…\n• Move Reminder in the same house as the Move Deleter.

(No more GameBoy Printer support.)\n• The Mystery Gift girl in Goldenrod Dept. Store gives you a random Berry once a day. (No more Mystery Gift support.)\n• The Poké Seer is replaced by the Stats Judge.\n• Lt. Surge's electric fences are back.\n• Celadon Dept. Store now has a TV Game floor and a Home Decor wing.\n• Revised in-game trades.\n• Revised Game Corner prizes.\n• Revised Buena's Password prizes.\n• The Odd Egg is always shiny, with an equal chance to be either gender.\n• Three of Prof. Oak's aides give you items as you complete the Pokédex.\n• Bill's grandpa gives you one of each evolutionary stone in Goldenrod City. Later they can be bought in Celadon Dept. Store.\n• Eusine shows you the legendary beasts in Celadon City in case you haven't found them roaming.\n• Respawn any fainted legendaries (except for Celebi) after beating the Elite Four. (Suicune roams instead of appearing in Bell Tower.) (Also respawns Sudowoodo.)\nTrainers:\n• Lyra from HG/SS is your friendly rival. She battles you and gives you some items throughout the game.\n• The four Rocket Executives from HG/SS are introduced.\n• New trainer classes: Elder, Rich Boy, Schoolgirl, Cowgirl, Battle Girl, Hex Maniac, Guitarist♀, Officer♀, Sr. & Jr., Couple, Breeder, PI, Dragon Tamer, Ace Duo, and Roughneck.\n• Battle Lorelei, Agatha, Bill, Valerie, and some other special characters.\n• Battle Cal in Viridian City's Trainer House if you're a girl, Kay if you're a boy.\n• Rematch the Elite Four at higher levels after earning all 16 badges.\n• Rematch Gym Leaders and other special trainers in the Fighting Dojo after earning all 16 badges.\n• Battle Tower has new trainers.\n• A few NPC trainers have shiny Pokémon.\n• Breeders can be rebattled like in B2/W2.\nItems:\n• Revised set of 65 TMs and 8 HMs.\n• Four new Poké Balls from Devon Corp.\n• Dome Fossil, Helix Fossil, and Old Amber.

It is an enhanced version of Pokémon Red and Blue, loosely based on the anime and is part of the first generation of the Pokémon video game series. Along with the release of Pokémon Yellow, a special edition yellow Pokémon-themed Game Boy Color was also released.\n\nLike its predecessors, it is a third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and a menu interface, in which the player configures their party of Pokémon, items, or gameplay settings. The player uses their Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During battle, the player may select one of up to four moves for their Pokémon to use, use an item, switch their active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have health points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon's level dictates its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYN9CKsrbts","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Game Freak","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"0e3ee813-fb4c-43aa-b640-bfd2e0fcc081.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"2509b768-ce67-4d63-b1d8-330f75a49fc2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"78473e61-c121-44f0-ab1a-91aa40b467c6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"b6711f08-5566-4e0e-9528-474e6dcfe8c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"200e7b60-22be-4d97-856e-2d12ba6c277d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"d5748994-1ead-4b84-929a-86bbb8c3c556.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"c8f5ae24-e7d3-4429-bdb3-4303e65e4124.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"5b68aed9-c0ab-45b7-b1ee-72818947765a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182181,"FileName":"7aef429f-f7d8-432e-aa37-bcd384da15cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":182181,"AlternateName":"Pokémon Edición Amarilla: Edición Especial Pikachu","Region":"Spain"}]},{"DatabaseID":22049,"Name":"Polaris SnoCross","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Get on a snowmobile and drive your way to victory with POLARIS SNOCROSS.

Gems \"fall in\" from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy.\n\nThe player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over.\n\nThe arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh_qDbO65XQ","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Evolution Entertainment","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"5be7f0e3-b7b5-4c32-9e91-b9875b47d2e7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"c349c330-db15-41a8-8319-b08ebf8fbe99.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"f40c57b3-6419-4f62-82a3-1cb4b8d8cc0a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"a9b524e3-26e4-41b2-a1c5-69d1dd51aacd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"bbe43eb4-ce4c-4177-be76-a1786b4d8338.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"7b5763a9-bbce-4049-8da5-040bf13eca23.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"79344fcc-2388-471b-bcc0-97427eb87b0c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"a4fe93c2-51e7-4a10-87da-44b5c881b04f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33090,"FileName":"b291d84d-670d-4df4-b9f7-0e247a876d9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167131,"Name":"Pumuckls Abenteuer bei den Piraten","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRbuTFUXXZw","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"NEON Software GmbH","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"1999-05-12T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167131,"FileName":"d3bab8b4-f7f0-47f8-b828-6c0437527fbd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":167131,"FileName":"203b4b0c-20b2-40bb-b706-33ee952b4dd8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167133,"Name":"Pumuckls Abenteuer im Geisterschloss","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"NEON Software GmbH","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167133,"FileName":"4644fc02-af50-4cc9-a4ba-9c543dcc9a4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":167133,"FileName":"556e3252-ce56-44d8-b896-acb846fa480f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":167133,"AlternateName":"Pumuckls Abenteuer im Geisterschloß","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":167546,"Name":"Puyo Puyo Gaiden: Puyo Wars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Puyo Puyo Gaiden: Puyo Wars is a turn-based strategy game released for the Game Boy Color.

Based on the coin-operated classic, QIX, this GBC sequel to the puzzle-based original offers similar gaming styles and a few welcome updates. In this take, you'll use a cursor to draw boxes on the screen, avoiding the Qix. If you can draw a compete box without the Qix touching its perimeter, that area of the screen will disappear and get you one step closer to advancing. Adding an element of story, QIX ADVENTURE casts you in the role of Speedy, a treasure hunter who's traveled to a mysterious island. Each level that you pass will help you in your quest to rid the island of all its strange creatures. Easy to learn but extremely difficult to master, QIX ADVENTURE is addicting fun for puzzle lovers and other gamers. Are you quick enough for Qix?

Choose one of three different monsters (each a gargantuan tower of rage), and then join your counterparts as you wreak holy terror on city after city. You'll stomp buildings, crush cars, and even take down innocent pedestrians in your strides to do as much damage as possible. Parents can rest assured: although the game's focus is on tearing apart the scenery, there's little of the blood and gore that pervades many video games these days. There are more than 130 stages to romp through in this tribute to silver screen terrors, and each level presents all-new challenges and more difficult gameplay.

There are plenty of clues hidden throughout the game's expansive levels, but if you're not careful the bad guys might get to you before you can solve the mysteries.

It’s Scrabble, right? True, but not as we know it. Ubi Soft has finally reproduced one of the world’s most popular board games for the handheld gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color. \n\nVisually, there’s really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The game consists of a series of white tiles each with their own letter and value. Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random letters, make a word out of 'em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional. \n\nSeven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest scoring word possible. Clearly, letters such as Q, X and Z have a greater value, but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited. Once you’ve chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or vertical fashion. Certain spaces on the board contain score boosters that will increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is particularly useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the process once your opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the highest scoring player wins. \n\nSo there you have it. It’s Scrabble on a handheld, and it’s brilliant.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Runecraft","Publisher":"Ubisoft, Mattel","ReleaseDate":"2001-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33096,"FileName":"1721a332-310f-4b83-a87b-4c1c7d5b5bc2.png","Type":"Box -

All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels.

This is very uncommon with unlicensed titles.\n\nThe second thing of note is that unlike the official The King of Fighters Game Boy games, that the characters are actually set up into teams instead of having random characters from all the teams. The only ones not set to teams are Iori and Shingo, who did not have teams in The King of Fighters '97.\n\nWhile many of the characters are taken from the previous official King of Fighters ports done by Takara, several of them are new sprite sets that were designed specifically for this game and do not appear in any official GB ports. The new characters are possibly rescaled in order to fit the regular sprite size.\n\nThe gameplay engine is based in Takara's original engine used in their official The King of Fighters ports, so the gameplay is very well done to be based on the GB hardware. All gameplay aspects including team/single options and the actual fighting engine is the same as those found in Takara's originals, with the exception of link play, which was removed.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Vast Fame","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183083,"FileName":"f595bb7d-caa2-49e5-a763-7227798ca0be.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":183083,"FileName":"407f9960-2a47-43bc-a85b-147154ca2de2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183083,"FileName":"b3317ea1-8d41-477b-82d0-5f223a6644e2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183083,"FileName":"b5482beb-ff8d-4831-8b1b-939b3b78f760.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":183083,"AlternateName":"Super Fighters 99","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183083,"AlternateName":"The King of Fighters 2000","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183083,"AlternateName":"The King of Fighters 2002","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":176316,"Name":"Super GALS!

Compared to Super Mario Bros., the game features a few minor visual upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a smaller screen due to the lower resolution of the Game Boy Colour.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Bm_jexH0I","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"1999-04-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"6e444b96-352a-4a6e-bd0f-545afecf9b5f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"197f4d32-a5ba-4104-8a73-336b31d8cec3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"6c0c986e-c070-4a0f-8763-a46e8727e32a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"65f26e66-d9a6-4134-a1fe-184ecdefc40d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"602e9cad-378e-47ca-b009-ca39c3f174ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"1e06f0ec-88c9-46e8-a5f2-7d02d3c4a01b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"e4d38873-0c9a-41df-b0eb-afc2356d1978.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"dae78e8e-0a89-49ad-af2c-556430c41d66.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"1e574ddb-58e2-4723-bcfe-506814a61db5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"f96a8ec2-226e-43e1-92d4-b27f887a6295.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"57f3f7fa-8489-412c-acfd-1d1883bb1481.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"26b189bb-4313-42f3-84c1-061ba9748a44.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"1c48a2ab-b726-4101-af85-ddf97a0fd0f4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"40fcac59-538b-43b7-94e9-2ae4c289c871.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"eb0bf73b-a743-432d-a3a5-79ed18d96839.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"60fbd5dd-73d3-4cd0-963d-76d506ca8822.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"78e50bd8-ffef-4b8f-a7d6-a4a280a7706d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"a9306318-808b-421d-a37a-684c71330938.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8655,"FileName":"5042c58b-7709-46ad-839d-867e8d592a88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8655,"AlternateName":"Super Mario Bros.

However, Raccoon Mario lacks most of its abilities from the original game as you can't fly or use the tail attack move. The only extra move that Raccoon Mario can perform is gliding in the mid-air by tapping B button rather than A button. Like the international version of the NES original, the Raccoon Mario power-up gives the player an extra hit.\n\nLike other Makon games such as Sonic 3D Blast 5 and Pokémon Adventure this game has five stages. Each level is completed by hitting a block at the end and collecting the Mushroom coming out of it (except for the fourth world, whose \"end block\" doesn't work). Beating the fifth \"Fortress\" level will activate the ending sequence, which shows a picture of two large sized flying Raccoon Marios with the words \"THE END\" accompanying it.\n\nThe overworld map is available, but there are no bonus games, nor can Mario interact with the Hammer Bro on the map. The player can also move freely on it in a similar way to Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, as Mario doesn't move around the map directly (unlike in the original Super Mario Bros. 3), but rather transports immediately to the selected spot. This was probably done intentionally, as sometimes, a raccoon leaf will appear in the box rather than a mushroom, leaving the player trapped, making the level impossible to beat. The levels follow the pattern of the original Super Mario Bros. 3, but only the first five levels are included. The levels themselves are remade from the original game, with the stages made about twice as long with an extra section added at the end.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Makon Soft","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183086,"FileName":"86b644ad-ade2-435d-bd49-fe3fb0c13acf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183086,"FileName":"f0f7a231-9b94-4954-aaf4-f56626d313f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183086,"FileName":"8317dfe8-43dc-4a60-bbe9-755a12edacdc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179222,"Name":"Super Me-Mail GB: Me-Mail Bear no Happy Mail Town","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179222,"FileName":"9f5f5b22-936a-4bdf-a5f8-eccbd985f787.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179222,"FileName":"25b34ef9-ee13-468a-9f54-bab33ef1f626.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179222,"FileName":"44581654-c51d-42ad-ae72-11c841d5125e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179222,"FileName":"85ba1eeb-e46e-4c3a-9284-c4dfbe1d19e8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179222,"FileName":"a25c5224-78f7-4fb4-9102-ff90ae944274.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179223,"Name":"Super Real Fishing","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super Real Fishing is a Sports game, published by Bottom Up, which was released in Japan in 1999.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Bottom Up","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":179223,"FileName":"f602260d-543a-4320-aabc-43ae3257a211.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179223,"FileName":"c6c7a8a8-da80-4a52-a4ee-ba468872a904.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":179223,"FileName":"bf270338-1ada-4bb5-85e2-ac122489393a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179223,"FileName":"1922fd98-5e11-4553-b853-4aad3b886fb6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167534,"Name":"Super Robot Pinball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Super Robot Pinball (スーパーロボットピンボール Sūpā Robotto Pinbōru?) is a spinoff title of the Super Robot Wars series, released by Banpresto and Media Factory in 2001 for Game Boy Color.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Media Factory","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167534,"FileName":"3826de50-9fec-4d20-9d2f-2d731fe4a109.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167534,"FileName":"eb44a281-b237-4f0f-813e-451efa02b00b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167534,"FileName":"c50f54d8-2fea-40df-b4a3-69d1f282b441.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167530,"Name":"Super Robot Taisen: Link Battler","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"1999-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167530,"FileName":"a978bb2c-34e7-49ab-8a5a-87948e416f3a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167530,"FileName":"034ef5bb-863f-4f16-bec9-53add48cf32c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33099,"Name":"Supercross Freestyle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Supercross Freestyle is a dirt bike racing game.

The story begins 205 years after the beginning of Tales of Phantasia.\n\nDue to the limits of the Game Boy, the game uses a battle system called Petit LMBS, a turn-based variation on the Linear Motion Battle System used by the rest of the series. As in normal LMBS, the player controls only one character and does so via button combinations instead of a dialogue choice, while party members are computer-controlled.

Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well.

The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format.

The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPbIqt3lMvI","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Bit Managers","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"2000-08-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":30731,"FileName":"367e05ad-bf7f-4143-aa72-febbe3442945.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30731,"FileName":"3b4b1d75-9ee7-4512-9a04-42f144d26e7b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30731,"FileName":"5ad53903-0f90-4c13-a528-c2b9f11cc96d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30731,"FileName":"29ccef15-0ba8-49cd-8a1e-b289d3394df7.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":30731,"FileName":"109e8d76-00ae-4ec4-bc2f-6f540403b85e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30731,"FileName":"04bf6768-1cbe-4568-b808-1f5642543676.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":30731,"AlternateName":"Tintin: Le Temple Du Soleil","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":22092,"Name":"Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Saves the Day","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Can these cartoon cuties ever catch a break?

But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.\n\nLegacy of Llylgamyn is the second entry (third entry for other platforms) in the Wizardry series for the Game Boy Color. Like its predecessor, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.\n\nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ASCII Entertainment","Publisher":"ASCII Entertaiment","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"11e9f750-9693-4977-8a89-86c17cb3e340.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"09b01edf-1397-42d6-acab-affac83d07d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"b7279b63-23ee-4837-8cb2-abefe06a2853.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"de4b31c8-6436-4e7a-9dec-3abbbf08079d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"32fcb173-8bea-4692-a12c-5a9d9ec2038b.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"3b8882f2-f7f7-427d-9d1e-0e22045485cd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"c75b2220-ed40-4ab3-95ac-588775211346.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"55f5cd51-a4d8-4f12-867b-275abcbc870b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105583,"FileName":"24e67f32-886e-4ca9-b986-ad3072e83755.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":105583,"AlternateName":"Wizardry II: Llylgamyn no Isan","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":105586,"Name":"Wizardry III: The Knight of Diamonds","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get the staff back along with Gnilda's blessing.\n\nThough Knight of Diamonds is the second scenario in the series, it was the third game in the series released for Famicom/NES and Game Boy Color. The NES version was redesigned to be played by new parties and the maps were re-designed to be non-linear. This makes the NES version more like a unique entry in the series rather than a port of the computer versions. The Famicom version is compatible with the ASCII TurboFile, an accessory that allowed the player to transfer characters between the Famicom Wizardry games. This feature was removed from the NES version. The Famicom version also allowed the player to switch between English and Japanese text.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ASCII Entertainment","Publisher":"Ascii Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2001-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"ff04cbc9-c4d4-4d3e-89fb-99d687dcd551.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"8904f302-5576-4f58-9893-1c9d6858840a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"4d9616a9-e8e7-4422-a4c3-22de60dc43a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"bbd38858-c2c3-497a-b209-043ba1a036f2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"7b8e5eff-4f60-4896-9c4d-8ea28221d5e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"9f0f2ee9-b693-4146-b835-b743440004ea.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"a72c6a87-9e3f-4061-8bcf-e07954e5a74e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"5977b92f-b20c-41ba-b231-ca3cc659df88.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"a3290654-cc79-41e8-9f0d-849f4cc03c59.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"FileName":"f1e3a5b1-82e8-4506-ad9f-c67b8c89a680.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":105586,"AlternateName":"Wizardry III - Knights of Diamonds","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":105586,"AlternateName":"Wizardry III: Knight of Diamonds","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":105586,"AlternateName":"Wizardry III: Diamond no Kishi","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":105584,"Name":"Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry?

The game's first two production runs were released with a limited edition Command Wolf model kit: red Imperial colors for the first run, and midnight blue and black for the second.\n\nThe story is said to be set between the Zoids: Chaotic Century and Zoids: Guardian Force anime series, and involves characters from that era. Beyond that, it seems to ignore the anime continuity. Van and Fiona are attacked by a wild Hellrunner in the grass outside his village, and discover that it was being driven mad by Rare Hertz. Not only was it affecting the Hellrunner, places all over the Western Continent are suddenly awash in it, and Zoids are going berserk.\n\nTeaming up with Irvine, Moonbay, and others along the way, Van and Fiona have to find their way through a number of caves and towers to stop the Zoids broadcasting the signals. They finally catch up with the man responsible, Professor Io, a scientist who was experimenting with \"Zoid genetics\". After breaking into his lair with a Madthunder (the only way to get past his Death Saurer), they confront him and his Geno Breaker. They soon discover that it wasn't the real threat, however, when Io reveals a Zoid contained in a giant pod while telling them about his son who was killed in the war. He integrated his son's genes in this Zoid: the Gilvader.\n\nWhen the Gilvader is defeated, Io remains behind in his collapsing base, presumably to die. The player can then go back and finish clearing all the levels of the caves of Rare Hertz, catch Zoids, and train them in a vaguely Pokémon style. The end Gilvader is also there to fight again despite it having been destroyed, but the Geno Breaker does not return.\n\nThe game is notable for containing every original Japanese release Zoid (other than Transfighters and 1/24 scale), as well as many customs from old boxes, early Zoids from the new line, and a few customs from a contest.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9QRoCV9OgM","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Will","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation","ReleaseDate":"2000-08-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"12961094-de49-4a83-ac2d-198a0937b050.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"82bfd544-3b32-4cba-9e68-d3854ac6c178.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"94b241ff-f2d7-44f6-90cc-02bdbd5483ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"685c15a4-8d0b-4202-8360-51356f702247.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"19114f9d-6d91-43cc-b799-a56299f67a3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"7ea57557-9551-47e0-a19a-dde7aa2903b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167193,"FileName":"a3abaa83-1d66-4c83-8d26-6a7256094202.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167194,"Name":"Zoids: Shirogane no Juukishin Liger Zero ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Designed specifically for the Game Boy Color, this game features the adventures of Allstar and his silver Liger Zero.
