Use your Magical Warp Wand to switch to new dimensions, but watch the touch screen when you flip to a new dimension - or you might just get crushed!\n\nMighty Flip Champs! is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DSi that uses both the top screen and the touch screen for play. The player controls Alta on the top screen, and the next dimension in the sequence is displayed on the touch screen. As Alta, the player is unable to jump - pressing A, B, X or Y instead uses the Warp Wand, which flips the dimension from the touch screen up onto the top screen. This allows you to progress forward by creating paths where there would otherwise be dead ends. However, it can also be dangerous if used recklessly, as you can crush Alta in a wall or make her fall straight onto spikes. At certain points in the game, the Warp Wand also malfunctions, and automatically flips to new dimensions after set periods of time. In these situations, you need to stay on your toes and react quickly to the level changes.\n\nMighty Flip Champs! DX is slightly altered to accommodate the platforms it is played on. As there is only one screen, the current dimension is displayed on the left of the screen, while the next dimension is displayed on the right of the screen, mirrored horizontally rather than vertically.","Publisher":"WayForward Technologies, Inc","ReleaseDate":"2011-07-12T00:00:00-07:00"},"15918":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Electronic Arts","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"c616942a-5897-4ded-8e35-34d32865cc97.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"263e5261-03a0-48de-84d8-47d43a1e085d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6d19569a-bb88-429f-892e-f60c84744a14.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Monopoly","Overview":"The Monopoly video games promise a fresh take on the timeless classic with accessible gameplay for players of all ages and skill levels.

With a title like that, you know it’ll be a tough ride… but \"The Impossible Game\" takes difficulty to a whole new level. It’s fast-paced and brutal, but with near-instant respawning, the experience is as smooth as it is deadly.\n\nYou play a humble orange square, racing against a serene blue background. The trick is that there are plenty of obstacles on this course: triangles are like deadly spikes, and squares can be jumped on top of but will kill you if you slam into them. Likewise, you can die if you fall through a hole in the floor. Your orange square will hurtle forward regardless of the danger, and your only control is simp: tap to jump. Longer taps equal longer jumps, and you’ll need meticulous precision if you want to survive. The music syncs with your music, which is a very nifty effect that adds to the surreal quality of the whole thing.\n\nMost of the time, you’ll only survive for a few seconds. The Impossible Game is unforgiving. Every time you die, the counter at the top of the screen takes note and then sends you straight back to the beginning. Most of the time it’s a constant cycle of death and rebirth, and you’ll quickly rack up hundreds of deaths. There’s only one level, but good luck finishing!\n\nThe Impossible Game would be truly impossible if not for Practice Mode. Tap the white flag, and it will materialize in the level where your block currently is. This places you in Practice Mode—when you die, you get sent back to the flag instead of the very beginning. This lets you get lots of practice with a specific sequence, so you might actually be able to win.","Publisher":"Grip Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U3eY1kD1tOc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Impossible_Game"},"19248":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"8265ec29-9dc3-46a1-8e6b-c60cf49862e3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"602e40a3-1162-4e51-bce7-db501f66a304.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"710542a0-de45-470e-a8d3-9d316bf15414.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Pinball Fantasies Minis","Overview":"After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created.

The Green Lasers, for example, lock onto one Vectoid and deal ongoing damage. The Red Spammer fires heat-seeking rockets at random targets in range. Blue Ray towers drain power and cause Vectoids to slow down. The in-game guide lists each tower in detail. Every few waves you’ll also be rewarded with a Yellow Energy Cell, which you can use to purchase one of three Boosts. Damage and Range Booster towers can be placed on a grid to increase the stats of other towers around it.\n\nVector TD for PSP features eight maps (two Beginner, three Normal, three Extreme) as well as all eleven tower and seven enemy types of the original Flash version.

Despite the title, most of the games have little or nothing to do with any traditional arcade-style games.\n\nThe five included games are:\n\nPairs A simple memory game where players must match sixteen pairs of cards. There are three skill levels to choose from. At the easiest level, the cards show pictures of simple objects. At the medium level, the cards show numbers. At the highest difficulty level, the cards show complex symbols. Players are also timed and high scores are awarded for uncovering multiple pairs in a row.\n\n15Puzzle The classic 4x4 \"sliding tile\" puzzle. There are three levels of difficulty. Choosing the easiest setting assigns a number to each sliding tile and requires players to correctly organize the numbers. The medium and high settings require players to properly arrange a picture. Each session is timed, and the players' best times are saved on a high score table.\n\nPool An eight-ball pool game for one or two players. Bonus points are awarded for sinking multiple balls in one shot and for \"chains\" (pocketing at least one ball in consecutive turns).\n\nSolitaire A standard Klondike Solitaire game with two modes of difficulty. The \"easy\" variant allows players to draw one card from the pile each turn while the \"hard\" variant requires players to draw three cards from the pile each turn. Additional points are awarded if the player is able to complete the game in a specified time limit.\n\nTetroid Of all the games included in the compilation, this is the one that most resembles something one might find in an arcade. Tetroid plays like Arkanoid flipped on its side. However, along with having to break the bricks, the play field slowly and continuously shifts toward the paddle as the game progresses. The game ends when a row containing one or more bricks meets the paddle.\n\nAll games have their own high score tables. If desired, a unique string can be generated for the player that will allow them to import their high scores onto a global leaderboard when entered on the developers' website.","Publisher":"Grip Digital","ReleaseDate":"2010-07-06T00:00:00-07:00"},"127535":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rovio","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"68119bf3-85b7-46f4-99b9-f92b6a1bec68.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ef8416d3-4967-4216-883b-a8ed6d986f07.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"094ade14-923c-4bce-9b92-1e9e27975f4c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Angry Birds","Overview":"The survival of the Angry Birds is at stake.

The game starts quite easy and gradually ramps up to insane levels of coco-bullet action.\n\nWhat makes the game addictive is the combination of the predictable mazes and the random coconuts and beach balls. It makes the experience similar to a racing game, where the first few attempts at a new track are difficult, but once you’ve learnt the track, you can hone your movements to perfection whilst confidently dealing with the other cars.\n\nCoconut Dodge works in a similar way as you learn to memorise and master the mazes. Most of the mazes in the game have two different routes; one that is nice and easy, and one that is more difficult. The difficult route always has more valuable treasure in it. So, when you come across a maze you can get through it quite easily, which makes the game suitable for some quick casual play on the bus.

The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.\n\nThe 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a \"mixed\" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.","Publisher":"System 3 Software","ReleaseDate":"2007-09-14T00:00:00-07:00"},"127809":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data East Corporation","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Platform; Shooter; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"3b365834-02d9-4ae4-b5d0-797e95b3c5e7.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"23207ba0-7da2-45b4-8d0b-76503a66633f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f6daace3-7fe2-4640-aa58-a6aeeeb2122f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e9a635a-11a0-4b71-862e-0764989cc354.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Express Raider","Overview":"Your aim in life is to be the greatest train robber in the Wild West, a multi-stage task.

The main game screen is mostly occupied by a central bare patch of land where the farm animals roam, surrounded by a series of farm implements and machines. All necessary actions are performed with clicks over interactive hotspots of the scenery.\n\nThe objective is displayed at the start of the level, usually requiring a certain amount of resources, money or other goals. Initially, the player has to click on the well to collect water and on the ground to grow the grass that feeds most of the livestock. The animals can be purchased from a tab at the top, to eat the turf and generate products every few moments. Geese lay eggs, sheep shed cotton, cows produce milk, and all these resources have to be collected and stacked on boxes at the bottom storage shed. The boxes have to be shipped to the market by clicking on the truck, that takes a few moments to make the transportation of all the selected goods. A small animation at the bottom-right shows the vehicle going back and forth between the farm and the city.\n\nDangerous bears appear randomly on the farm, and kill any animal that cross their paths. They have to be quickly contained on cages, and afterwards collected on boxes to be sold as a product. If the cage remains untouched on the field for too long, the bear eventually breaks free and runs out of the farm. The storage space at the bottom is limited, and sometimes bears and other products can't be stored on time and disappear after a while.\n\nThe structures surrounding the game field are used to process the raw materials produced by the farm into more refined products, like powdered eggs, cheese, baked goods and other items. The stars received after completing a level have to be spent on upgrades to the machines on the shop screen, to make them more efficient and unlock new levels. There is no time limit to complete each stage, but finishing within a specific time frame, shown at the top, gives awards and bonus stars.","Publisher":"Alawar Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2010-12-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Farm_Frenzy"},"127812":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alawar Entertainment","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"debbf287-e4ca-49b3-bf28-c99238d93c34.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0121df88-c492-4879-8ca1-2bda9683a703.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dda7edaa-ec96-4a34-82a8-9cda0d014915.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Farm Frenzy 2","Overview":"Farm Frenzy 2 is a Strategy game published by Alawar Entertainment released on March 7, 2012 for the Sony PlayStation Portable.","Publisher":"Alawar Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"127813":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alawar Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"1557296a-fe5b-4c0e-aaf5-f6b053c7645d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"af4dc3e8-1adb-4e2e-beec-23cbe504dc71.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1629692e-ce39-45cc-a52c-98dd4300e2b7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Farm Frenzy 3","Overview":"Farm Frenzy 3 is a time management game in which you have to fulfill tasks in a certain time.

The game is shown through a wire-frame iris that becomes smaller when the player takes damage. When one more hit will cause the player to die, it becomes very thin and turns red. To complete a level players need to avoid objects and collect glyphs for bonus points. Every tenth glyph is a major one that looks different than the rest. Grabbing it earns the player more points and a level achievement. At level 10 this wins the game and provides a new form, an alien monster pic, and a special badge on the high score list.\n\nThe music syncs with the rhythm, movement and speed of the levels and the graphics are altered accordingly. During levels, the gameplay usually becomes faster, making it harder to dodge objects. To compensate, a button can be used to slow down time to get past obstacles with precision. The game's controls are very straightforward, only steering is needed, using the mouse, a joystick or a gamepad.","Publisher":"Hands-On Mobile","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-30T00:00:00-07:00"},"127817":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Subatomic, Twitchy Hands","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"62b68103-5266-40a5-b598-29ebae9b4ef5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"af365dd3-dc89-4811-91ac-5e6faf46118b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fieldrunners","Overview":"In Fieldrunners, your goal is to defend and control a field using a diverse selection of upgradeable towers over countless waves of enemies, fighting off many land and air combatants to achieve the ultimate victory!\n\nUpgraded for PlayStation Portable, this edition of Fieldrunners includes additional content, from new maps and towers to new fieldrunners!

As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.","Publisher":"G1M2","ReleaseDate":"2010-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"127828":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dakko Dakko","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0b6fab38-38dd-4be1-a27d-a210c7c128d9.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"272dccda-aa75-4b8c-9709-82f505b74790.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a358f95-ae3b-4913-b3d6-17a2f79acac3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"182cd479-0037-40c8-a480-4ed263831e23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"926692aa-d6f4-44c1-9837-11afbc72db39.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"65f34e23-3818-4f87-bd21-8fb8646804b4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2458bed4-f063-43a3-8664-6957654211dd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims","Overview":"Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita.  \n\nFloating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories.\n\nYour own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more.\n\nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you.\n\nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self.\n\nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going.\n\nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out.\n\nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes.  The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils.\n\nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness.\n\nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve.\n\nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better.\n\nSeems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in.\n\nThat's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.\n\nThis description was compiled from the following reviews:\nhttp:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/articles\/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review\nhttp:\/\/www.pspminis.com\/8859\/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here\/","Publisher":"Dakko Dakko","ReleaseDate":"2006-06-29T00:00:00-07:00"},"127860":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Laughing Jackal","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"1de9b269-8c58-4128-8601-886ddb18d781.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c7ce7024-555f-4604-b63c-a96fad97a49f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e800973-1f43-4f4a-a9f0-23049cad4972.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hungry Giraffe","Overview":"It sucks when you're hungry.

He is put on trial at the Galactic Council for allowing hordes of doom beasts to rampage through Earth's cities. The council consists of all the guardians of the other planets and is led by Jupiter's. To prove his innocence, he needs to recounts his version of the events, how he battled the monsters, to gather evidence. The player has to play each memory of the invasion as a series of levels to prove you, as a guardian, did sufficient effort to stop it.\n\nThe Guardian of Earth flies at a constant speed and can be moved to any part of the screen. His left arm is replaced with a basic laser with unlimited bullets to take out enemies. Different waves of enemies appear from the right side of the screen. The Guardian is actually completely invincible and he cannot die or lose health. To finish a level he has to prevent the basic black monsters called Ravagers from passing by so they don't leave through the left side of the screen. Per level only fifty Ravagers can pass or the game is over. These black creatures are very easy to take down and do not even fire, but they come in large hordes and need to be taken out quickly. Next to his basic attack the Guardian can also hover over them to grab them and rip them apart.\n\nThere are many more powerful creatures as well and those do attack. They largely serve to prevent the Guardian from taking out the black creatures. They move in front of them to absorb the fire, and their bullets and attacks can temporarily stun the character or move him away. Many large monsters often need to be weakened before the Guardian can grab them and perform a quick sequence of buttons to take them out with a powerful attack, similar to a quick-time event. Large enemies do not necessarily need to be destroyed and are allowed to leave the screen without any repercussions. At the end of the level there is always a giant boss. If the Guardian holds off multiple waves of enemies in succession, a power bar in the bottom left side of the screen is built up. It consists of three levels and for reaching each level a powerful attack can be executed, such as a faster firing rate or a giant laser beam. As soon as a Ravager manages to escape, the bar is reset.\n\nNext to the main Story Mode with four settings to unlock, there is an Infinite Mode and a Challenge Mode.","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment America","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vzEpxIJKQok"},"128079":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c3da4270-ae5b-4e5a-92e5-29c5cdd31bae.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c352e5a5-41fc-439e-94f1-c85a4153ae84.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f3356dc4-e034-406b-b8ae-495dca3bf52e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"War of Sonria","Overview":"War of Sonria is a turn-based strategy game where you play the role as a battle commander.\n\nCreate your own band of hand-picked soldiers and fight through a plethora of immersive environments.

The town of Jalombe is under attack by such zombies, and she has been summoned to help exterminate them. Together with Father Richiardo at the monastery, she must find and destroy the source of the outbreak before Jalombe is destroyed.\n\nTwin Blades is a scrolling action game where the player must slaughter waves of zombies as they spring up from the ground, using both a variety of different guns and a very large scythe. Killing zombies nets the player zombie hearts, which can be exchanged at the monastery for weapon and power upgrades, including new guns, more health, and even new moves. There are several types of zombies, some of which are resistant to certain attacks, and every so often a much larger, more difficult boss creature will appear.\n\nThe player can freely travel between open areas, and as stages are played, night will fall, which will cause zombie swarms on other stages to replenish and strengthen. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a survival mode where the player must survive 31 days against endless swarms of zombies.","Publisher":"Sanuk Games SARL","ReleaseDate":"2011-02-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JDl8x_dE0lg"},"128152":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visual Shape","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"3a7dd400-861c-494b-81cf-91fb1e6e1c6c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6902f519-7a1e-4f59-9c0a-349b675cb578.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3314aba-bc7e-40d3-8d90-8220a7944b40.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"The Treasures of Montezuma","Overview":"The Treasures of Montezuma is another rendition of Bejeweled which has players solving \"match 3\" puzzles while following a non-interactive adventure storyline.\n\nThe objective during the tile matching games is to collect all of the sparkling gems in a level before the time runs out on the ticking pocket watch.

Levels are accessed one by one on a large world map and they branch out at a certain point with multiple paths.\n\nPuzzles are based on platforming and using the abilities of different creatures. Freek can use his trident to skewer other minions, carry them around or use them as a pogo stick to jump higher. One type of creature rushes and can knock Freek over large gaps. Another type acts as a trampoline. Creatures can sometimes be dropped into the lava to create safe passages. A hug block rushes to hug you. By taking it out up to three can be skewered to use them as a bridge. Creatures are summoned through portals at specific locations. Freek can also draw their attention by whistling. Freek has his own portals that act as checkpoints when he passes them. Some levels require you to locate a number of peppers to unlock a pepper portal before a level can be finished.

The game features four fictitious golf courses in Fiji, England, USA and Scotland. The goal is of course to get the ball into the hole with the flag in as less strikes as possible. To make it harder for the players to meet that goal, the courses are littered with obstacles like hills and sand bunkers. In addition the wind decides too where the player's ball lands.\n\nAs opposed to real life though, the player can influence the ball's flightpath during the flight by choosing in which direction it spins. This allows to compensate for wind and also for a bad angle at the strike. How hard the player hits the ball is decided by a gauge where the player needs to click at the right moment. The same goes for the angle. Although the game hands the player a club that it thinks fits the situation, he can also choose his own.","Publisher":"Gameloft","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DjfdVl-godY"},"134264":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony Computer Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"51f64f5e-810a-439f-bac5-225967cf76e5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b349e330-05ba-4ff5-83c8-1725c9c73431.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fcc19d13-42df-4484-b0e3-c00fa08a241d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"e7778739-aa70-434c-a1c3-102a17d90696.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4a21b57f-4e4d-42b3-a397-2efe76266634.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c62c43e9-1228-4e70-ab83-9a3c3a39103b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Love Cupid","Overview":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be Cupid?

Chief Constable Melville Macnaghten investigated the case and wrote a final report naming five suspects.\n\nReal Crimes: Jack the Ripper is the second entry in a series of a hidden object games based on actual murder cases. As Macnaghten and the notorious forensic scientist Francis Galton, the player must search and click on all the items listed at left side of the screen, on locations related to the case and filled with assorted objects. Some of the items are clues about the murders, bringing up a window at the center of the screen with details about the object and its relation to the case. The hint button is a police badge below the list, that shows the position of one of the required items when activated.

He is skating with his friends in the street when looking for a better ramp they use the one next to the mansion of professor Klumpfus. He accidentally falls down a pipe and ends up inside the mansion. One of the professor's experiments has gone wrong and his main computer has locked the house while genetically engineered creatures have escaped. Archie needs to complete levels to reach the computer and reset it.\n\nTo complete a level Archie needs to reach the exit door. He moves around on his skateboard and can also jump. He can move through pipes and ride longer to get a higher speed and jump farther. He needs to avoid acid, spikes, crushers, bullets, lasers and creatures as he does not have a weapon to kill them. A lot of doors are locked and can only be opened by pulling a lever. Other puzzle elements involve buttons, floor triggers, temporary platforms, fans, teleporters and pulling down chains. In certain levels Archie can launch and steer a pink bubble to reach parts of the levels that are otherwise inaccessible. Bubbles are affected by fans and can sometimes be used to pick up objects and drop them, for instance a bomb to clear a passage. This technique is also used to move crates or to activate buttons out of reach. He also needs to avoid falling down large heights. This can be prevented by bouncing off the wall's edge while dropping down. Levels sometimes have respawning devices that act as checkpoints.\n\nAfter the initial skateboard levels he also gets to use a maintenance pod that can climb along walls and ceilings, and eventually also a jet-powered craft. The game was initially launched with 114 levels (Trapped in the Mansion), but later on two expansion packs were added: The Great Cleanup (49 levels) and Just for Fun (28 levels) with over 190 levels in total.","Publisher":"Rake in Grass","ReleaseDate":"2010-07-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"152705":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PomPom Software","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Platform; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9269d5aa-b282-43a1-9664-7d01a88169ab.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"73ca0c02-0868-45d0-a884-a01097093920.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Alien Zombie Death","Overview":"In Alien Zombie Death, players take on the role of the Spaceman who is working all alone on mining platforms, and who is constantly under siege by Alien Zombies..\n\nThe game consists of fourteen levels (seven planets each with their own moon).

The player has to help them piece back together the environment so they can get home to the tree where they live. The game consists of 26 single screen levels. They are completed when the three spirits reach the magical tree.\n\nThe three spirits always appear at the start of the level and are controlled separately by switching between them. They are all able to move around and jump. They can stand on top of each other to reach platforms and buttons can make blocks and platforms appear in the environment. In specific locations they can form a tower of three spirits and the one at the top then transforms into a magical creature with a specific ability. The brown spirit becomes Antler Ancestor who can double jump. The orange spirit becomes Rainbow Spirit and can rotate the world. The black spirit becomes Bat King and is able to illuminate the environment to reveal platforms only visible to it.\n\nThe most prominent puzzle element of the game is that the level is split up in several comic-book panels. These form a single environment, but are often not in the right order and all over the screen. Even though they are apart, the logical sequence of the panels is maintained, meaning that if a character exists a panel to the right, it will appear in the next panel following the logical order, regardless of the position of the panel on the screen. The most difficult puzzles are used in conjunction with the orange spirit's ability to rotate the world. The character can jump, freeze in the air and then rotate the world to continue in another panel, even if that would be logically impossible. If the character is released outside of a panel or if any character falls down a gap, it dies immediately but restarts from the beginning.\n\nNext to merely completing a level, it is possible to finish it in a better way by collecting all hearts along the way. There is also a perfect way to complete a level by collecting all hearts without dying once. Levels are unlocked one after another, but by perfecting them it is possible to reveal some earlier.","Publisher":"Die Gute Fabrik, LLC","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q2V13vFI8rA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Where_Is_My_Heart%3F"},"157758":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Halfbrick Studios","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a4a4313f-c0ff-4888-821c-c710b65ac736.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8748c33b-8508-49c9-8e9d-3f2b84be0c47.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"00e042b1-984a-4bb5-84c2-d7784ee3bc48.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f142e31f-697a-4b40-b2c7-84408cd03708.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0b8562b8-86c7-41c4-a44b-4bc5b7fff1ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jetpack Joyride","Overview":"Barry Steakfries works as salesman for a gramophone-making company, but the business is about to go bust, due to low sales.

As before, you are Pac-Man and you are in a maze with dots, power pellets and hosts. The object is to eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, unless you eat a power pellet, which gives you the ability to eat the ghosts for a few seconds.\n\nWhat's new here is many different mazes and modes. This is designed from the ground up as a console game, so some arcade traditions are lost. The object is no longer to try to survive\/get a high score without losing quarters, but to get a high score in a set time limit. You do still have a set number of lives, which makes your time end early if you lose all them.\n\nUnlike the original or its prodigy, Championship Edition isn't broken into distinct levels. Once you clear one side of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side. Eating the fruit regenerates the empty half with new walls, dots, power pellets, etc and increases the game speed.\n\nThe iPhone version of the game adds two additional modes. In \"Mission Mode\", you must clear a specific goal set by the game at the beginning of play (such as eating two apples, or eating eight ghosts consecutively). In \"Challenge Mode\", you must aim to achieve the top score for each course, but this time the ghosts have been sped up so that they are initially much faster.\n\nThe look is a bright neon which evokes the classic Pac-Man but takes advantage of nearly 30 years of increased computer power.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games America","ReleaseDate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"157934":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"469770d9-6831-4b2a-b1ac-e9f6823133d3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d32777ba-1f24-41c4-be2f-95bee4d2ae60.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"One Two Boat Racing","Overview":"Welcome to the wet wild world of One Two Boat Racing, where you need to use your reflexes and speed to stay in the lead, beat the competition, and be the first to reach the finish line.

Just like in the original game the player controls a hurricane in an attempt to steer polluted clouds into cleansing factories, to create cleaner air and thwart global warming. Polluted clouds are sent out gradually and these are drawn towards the hurricane that can move about freely on the screen. By moving the hurricane and keeping track of all pollution, the clouds need to be steered into the factories. Borrowing from the mechanics of Tower Defense games, the pollution needs to be moved away from high pressure zones. These zones immediately absorb the pollution and disperse it, adding 10% to the global warming percentage. Similarly, having pollution touch the hurricane yields a 20% percentage. When 100% is reached, Earth is destroyed and the game is over.\n\nThe game consists of 30 levels that are unlocked in six tiers, along with a tutorial. New tiers become available by collecting perfect clear ribbons; clearing stages with 0% percentage. The game has a retro look and all levels are played in single, non-scrolling screens. In later levels multiple pollution appears at once and it often needs to be guided through small passages. Two additional keys allow the player to speed up or speed down the pollution, but this does not affect the entire game time. By completing levels players unlock monitors that give the game a different look.

The game takes places in the land of Fortiana where the reign of evil forces have turned the place into a desolate wasteland. The player takes control of the heir of the late king, Knight Fortix in his attempt to reclaim the land from the dark ruler.\n\nThe kingdom consists of twelve shires, each a level in the game. Each level has one or several enemy buildings and the goal is to conquer all of them. As in Qix the player can move around the borders of the playfield safely. By moving inwards and leaving the base line the player draws lines. This makes him vulnerable towards the enemies. By connecting his line with the base line the player can conquer land. Any enemy that is encircled will be killed. The monsters of Fortix are different kinds of dragons with different capabilities. The player also has to watch out for towers that shoot pellets whenever the player leaves the base line. These can be taken out with the use of catapults. These are triggered when the player encircles an halberd icon. There is one catapult for each tower on the map. Towers can also be taken out by conquering the land they are on.\n\nThere is different kinds of terrain in the game which impacts the movement speed of the player. Walking on grass is fast while water and swamps are slower to traverse. There is also walls that the player can't move through and has to find a way around. The player will find power ups scattered around the levels which he can pick up by encircling them. These can do many things from increasing the player's speed to freezing the monsters for a short time.","Publisher":"Nemesys Games","ReleaseDate":"2010-04-23T00:00:00-07:00"},"173061":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fb62abe4-8dba-4c89-8ec7-0133193fc6cb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2a189bc3-a0b2-43f8-baaf-c63f0ada4445.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bed3e1b2-2fe3-4acb-8d6c-d74787c2ba72.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"Name":"Ikari Warriors","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2011-06-19T00:00:00-07:00"},"173535":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"GameShastra","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c4682af0-7465-4b58-a5bd-5cfc07bbb8d3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Free Shot Frenzy","Publisher":"GameShastra","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-22T00:00:00-08:00"},"173536":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cobra Mobile","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8c40c57a-38a7-4c02-acfc-8a68b186d46c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c92af44a-d7b5-4c98-b508-2753cffe8794.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Numba","Publisher":"Cobra Mobile","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-02T00:00:00-07:00"},"173537":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Icon Games","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"4108f858-e60f-4f03-b854-4d1cf5e1eda1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Soccer Bashi","Publisher":"Icon Games","ReleaseDate":"2011-02-15T00:00:00-08:00"},"173538":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Ben Interactive","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"31b621d4-4e4f-4de4-9d02-8b7f37d4a741.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c4161c7b-f41b-4e04-9e92-e6f17df56f5a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Solitaire","Publisher":"Big Ben Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2011-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"173539":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gaea Mobile Limited","Images":[{"FileName":"ee76f169-3d82-41cd-a5a7-f15ebaad1780.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"10a24ecb-4a31-4700-8ad5-661e0dcffb4e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sudoku","Overview":"Sudoku allows the player to play Sudoku on his console or handheld.
