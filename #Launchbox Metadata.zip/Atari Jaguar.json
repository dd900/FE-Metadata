{"Name":"Atari Jaguar","Games":[{"DatabaseID":22351,"Name":"AirCars","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Designed by Midnight Entertainment Group in 1995, ICD released AirCars in limited numbers. No real box was made (it came shrinkwrapped inside a box insert), but the cartridge included a label and manual, along with a picture of what the overlay might look like. This is an action/battle game in which you must destroy enemy bases while in your Air Car, and it supports up to 8 players using CatBoxes or 2 players using a JagLink. Although better graphics can be found on the Jaguar and control is a bit sluggish, linking 8 players using CatBoxes can be a unique experience. The hard part will be finding those extra CatBoxes and copies of AirCars.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaOjwss7Pqs","Platform":"Atari Jaguar","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"MidNite Entertainment","Publisher":"ICD","ReleaseDate":"1997-05-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"5b31690d-57a0-4548-b7bc-5590c64f5daa.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"1af68ecb-c183-4aa8-91b3-136f237093c2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"626cb570-81ec-4caf-9d80-feed5aa5f644.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"c03c7cea-2923-43e4-93a8-889e90e18cb8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"1c203dcc-afe1-4284-a442-e63ab14b7d05.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"d782e147-cd2f-480e-b0f0-c0af8bf81c68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"cf534feb-ce97-4c77-bc0e-5b29ef4acb9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":22351,"FileName":"71ad102c-a23e-4cac-9807-cb2132697984.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189867,"Name":"Aircars 94","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"AirCars 94 is a prototype version of AirCars.

Most of the rules from the sport are present in the title, though they can be disabled from the menu and in-game options. Some of the gameplay options found within the game include an exhibition match, regular season and playoff competitions, among other modes of play. The announcer, Al Michaels, makes commentary during gameplay and announces Brett Hull by name but other players are only called by their respective jersey number due to the lack of the NHL license, while his commentaries can also be turned off on the options menu. Season progress is only kept via password and there is also a two-player option for every mode.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari Jaguar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Ringler Studios","Publisher":"B&C Computervisions","ReleaseDate":"2004-01-09T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":156794,"FileName":"62df536b-1341-4f14-b2c6-8fadb783379b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":156794,"FileName":"ca464884-9753-4535-83ce-ad13f872ee7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156794,"FileName":"ed1c01a1-aea3-4a81-b24c-5714f1415234.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":156794,"FileName":"fe44bcd4-22c5-439d-b0d8-97d0c355ba37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":156794,"FileName":"ca915a45-3d7b-4ab5-9d6d-c1ac21f75b4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":156794,"FileName":"552deb83-48f2-4acf-aa31-dacc2a32e5da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156794,"AlternateName":"Brett Hull Hockey","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156794,"AlternateName":"Jaguar Hockey","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":14801,"Name":"Brutal Sports Football","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Do you like action but reckon that chainsaw massacres are for grannies' tea parties?

From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.\n\nIn addition to the basic 'build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZB0AJ7Ymo0","Platform":"Atari Jaguar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cinemaware, Inc.","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":"2018-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"053173f5-c4cf-44fe-9f5f-a559673f8d21.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"aa0c66fa-d74b-4912-b959-edc4485e558f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"c287ae3b-d082-47e5-84ae-475585b3eedd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"5af4a4bc-2781-445e-b8a8-3517d4534234.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"0ed65d59-8b2c-4442-92ee-ca8bf11e45d8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"05fa2731-d062-47c3-a5dc-12dd3cc63f3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":189955,"FileName":"b9de992d-73ee-4cdf-8808-b1d6a9d58b35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190611,"Name":"Degz","ReleaseYear":"2012","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GSHoMAnzMs","Platform":"Atari Jaguar","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Reboot","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190611,"FileName":"67f85d16-ea2d-45e9-a7e0-9b0680361815.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":190611,"FileName":"484bcbc4-6229-4d04-a943-4343844cd356.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":190611,"FileName":"8ddb7105-b30c-4742-abf1-9b55e1ea5c38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":2878,"Name":"DOOM","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From outside the base you hear the carnage: guns firing, men screaming, bones cracking...then silence.

Throughout the game, you will also find weapon power-ups and tank upgrades (such as shields, radar, and auto-targeting) to help you stay effective against the increasing numbers of enemy defenders. You can save your progress to the cart at the end of each level.\n\nBetween levels are bonus rounds where you pilot your tank through a corridor and try to collect a set percentage of data pods.

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\n\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\n\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.\n\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\n\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/W3x3GO8S08A","Platform":"Atari Jaguar","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Audiogenic Software","Publisher":"Songbird Productions","ReleaseDate":"2018-11-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":192245,"FileName":"a3c9d41d-8777-4671-9244-7809848ab7d6.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":192245,"FileName":"ec75d7af-4053-4318-8b10-ef359ce748de.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":192245,"FileName":"c983808d-6182-4311-8a26-47b8b28ce4a2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":192245,"FileName":"edbe184a-61b4-4354-834b-6befd0844f44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":192245,"FileName":"b64819ee-16ad-479b-8558-eaaddd1de2ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20273,"Name":"Missile Command 3D","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Prepare For The Alien Attack!\n\nAliens are out to take over your colonies and it's up to you to stop them.

It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.\n\nGameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. \n\nThere's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.\n\nThere are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbyhwdw8FE&list=PLfKKp0Sr0SAJ8iJSOLJr8vDBvdsemjptM&index=3","Platform":"Atari Jaguar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Team17","Publisher":"Telegames","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"da15de27-dc7a-43b1-81a3-69cfc786b98f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"eb2d2a98-37a0-4273-91c7-41af4c2b0f99.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"ff2a9dc5-8648-498a-accd-b98d5b6e3dbf.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"81765a63-71d6-4d79-a0b9-a759ed4d80ef.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"7868ff07-ba56-4b21-add8-f0c726769de1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"92cf2f35-10b7-421f-9f6c-e23ef0dff22f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"e5433fbe-716a-4ed8-9c5e-f60fc0fb5758.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"22847885-b082-491f-9a71-d7dc195e71a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":20276,"FileName":"dfa2a4cc-0e12-443a-8506-dfaf9205d60d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190530,"Name":"Xenon 2 - Megablast","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature.
