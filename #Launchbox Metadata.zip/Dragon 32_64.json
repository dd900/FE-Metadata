The extra memory is used to add in another feature of the original arcade game, speech, which is featured in its Microdeal title, Talking Android Attack.\n\nLike in Berzerk, you are a lone humanoid in a large complex with lots of maze-like rooms. Your objective is to survive, and earn points by exterminating all the hostile robots that inhabit the complex. Shooting a robot (before it shoots you) turns it into a heap of deadly scrap, which will reanimate after a short while, though not into the android it once was, but into a ghost. The ghosts can pass through walls and try to fulfill the mission of their former life. This is a slight deviation from the original Berzerk, where the ghost was a separate character named \"Evil Otto\". Another difference is that in this version, you can jump and duck to avoid robot bullets.\n\nAnother peril in the game is the walls, which are electrified. By sacrificing an energy unit, of which you need at least three, you can open up a hole in the wall to pass through. On each screen there is also a crown, which can be picked up for 100 points. Killing an android gives 50 points, and killing its ghost gives you another 100. By eliminating all enemies and picking up the crown and exiting the room, you are granted a bonus sum calculated from the remaining time (when it reaches zero, you are killed). For every 10000 points, you earn another energy unit. If you leave the room without having killed the enemies, the computer will say in wobbly 6-bit speech, \"Coward!\".","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175416,"FileName":"74650776-1b30-45ca-b9aa-de51417408ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175416,"FileName":"f150a5fe-9b01-4ee0-9ce2-3fc7f10d9a06.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175416,"FileName":"7c0cd817-96f6-418c-802d-4bdaee1ce259.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175416,"FileName":"ba50b025-02f7-48f5-8b58-78c338f023c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175416,"FileName":"05b53ad8-6ff4-4bf7-839c-4475f3388fb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175416,"AlternateName":"Talking Android Attack","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":175511,"Name":"Android Invaders","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175511,"FileName":"566da51e-58ec-4294-be1f-f028c5bdfa6e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175511,"FileName":"c5d27382-da7f-4b48-a27d-1a92c43311e9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175511,"FileName":"72ad48f3-241b-4d3d-a970-34a62dc106e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175419,"Name":"Aquanaut 471","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175419,"FileName":"5201f85e-a322-4851-b0e2-80b6801a9cab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175419,"FileName":"17c2fe16-11c1-4720-80ce-349e42667231.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175512,"Name":"Arcadia","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Arcadia is a space shoot 'em up along the lines of Galaxians and Space Invaders.

You can kill them with your pistol but ammo is limited and you lose a life if you are hit by these or they take a crew member back to the station.

Written by Steve Bak at Microdeal, the game features the hero Cuthbert, who also appears in Cuthbert Goes Walkabout and Cuthbert in the Mines. In the game, the player guides Cuthbert through levels of girders, avoiding 'moronians' fatal to the touch.\n\nThe gameplay is basically that of Space Panic: Cuthbert kills moronians by digging holes and causing them to fall down. On later levels, different coloured moronians are harder to kill and must be knocked through two platforms. Cuthbert also battles a time limit on each level, represented by an amount of oxygen remaining. Cuthbert's ability to dig holes can also be used to quickly drop to a lower platform without the use of a ladder. The game is an example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien, Lode Runner, and Boomer's Adventure in ASMIK World.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Microdeal","Publisher":"Microdeal","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"9faf4b98-91a9-465b-adb6-75532b13248c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"6b3f8295-ae4f-4cd6-8027-eccf1f513346.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"7d3ccfc4-9c6a-4de0-9a7c-64854a981add.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"4e38aeb5-868e-45b1-952b-d2fd7c735ed1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"69611a78-b2ef-4437-99f6-4daae76c32ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"c260120e-d0f3-4daa-b014-b91bbedee0c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33375,"FileName":"1bc0887d-eeaf-4af0-912e-d5808d11f361.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158430,"Name":"Cuthbert Goes Walkabout","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Cuthbert is on the Lunar Landing Pad, waiting for the Federal Chief's State Visit.

Now the action becomes more challenging. Robots descend from the top of the screen moving in a zig-zag pattern that somehow homes in on your location and at the same time they drop bombs. \nLevel 4 is the Sproing wave. Spring-mounted aliens descend and then bounce back up when they hit the bottom of the screen, resulting in a chaos of aliens flying in all directions and often ending up with them crushing your ship.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tom Mix Software","Publisher":"Microdeal","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"504e6179-035d-44c1-ae8e-f8798f593df1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"f39029b5-5291-4766-8c80-faf642ca194a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"c4a30ff9-f7dd-4767-8a25-9fefceb87dd7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"11930f30-fbba-4a55-9415-b769c4eae24a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"791dc317-a14f-490a-9203-b3268a4a4aaf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"7731a589-14e8-4368-a9dc-de9850aec4e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164944,"FileName":"37f81910-fd52-409f-a32f-d78318c62544.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171339,"Name":"Devil's Island","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Apex Trading","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171339,"FileName":"a4825817-fa40-4e18-bdff-7be244d57c93.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171339,"FileName":"4f72a5ab-95a2-4675-b49c-7efea57ce8c2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171339,"FileName":"4b69de44-9d68-4b68-884b-f10b89e4bb92.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171340,"Name":"Devil's Triangle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171340,"FileName":"ac0001d7-8314-4efb-ac64-170cad83ff29.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171340,"FileName":"3df5bdfe-9bce-4e1b-b08c-536971f87727.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171340,"FileName":"3f8035c9-c3fc-4c29-ad5c-c41ffc63851d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171347,"Name":"DoDo","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171347,"FileName":"3ffbdc14-c5d0-4654-87d3-a557e0a24cf0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171347,"FileName":"171b2e91-dcc7-4d27-b888-8e6a37d0b727.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171347,"FileName":"283a8c3a-8d37-4d87-b5ee-dd74761b9418.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171347,"FileName":"d2b71ac8-f9a7-40d4-943f-a730b5097895.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137070,"Name":"Donkey King","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Donkey King is an unofficial remake of the coin-op game Donkey Kong.\nWhen Microdeal found itself facing accusations of infringing on the original Donkey Kong series (see the Dragon User magazine of June 1983 for more details), the name was changed to The King.\n\nThe game can be played at normal or slow speed.

Just like the yellow pill-eater, you guide your sprite around a maze populated by nasties, and can only escape once you've eaten all the pills in the maze. A baddie in the centre of the screen will spawn a new baddie every time the running meter on the score panel has reached zero.\n\nThe powerup system does not work like Pac-Man, though. No invincibility pills are available, instead, there are a number of letters from the words \"special\" and \"extra\" displayed at the top of the screen. When the letters are the same colour as the words they belong to, you begin to spell out those words, granting you either a \"special\" round or an \"extra\" life. Additionally, the heart bonuses act as score multipliers for your pills.\n\nWithout any power pills, your bug is quite vulnerable. Therefore, the environment must be used to its advantage. Many walls in the Doddle Bug maze function like revolving doors which, when passed, will rotate to block the path of a baddie that could otherwise hunt you down.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"David Crandall","Publisher":"Dragon Data","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171349,"FileName":"81dc342a-d203-4608-8bfc-4461b1c33ab1.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171349,"FileName":"08f26841-1f0e-4d0e-854b-d0a78afba7ad.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136179,"Name":"Downland","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"In Downland, the object is to locate keys which unlock doors as you navigate underground caverns by climbing ropes and jumping or swinging across chasms.

EDWARD will now destroy anything that comes within range, problem is the planet Venus is less than 24 hours away and will be completely destroyed unless EDWARD is shut down. You have been given the mission of moving around the ship, deck by deck to shut each one down but this can only be achieved by destroying a certain amount of droids that move around the ship. The game is viewed from the side with the screen split into two of the various levels for each deck which need exploring for droids by using conveyor belts to move up or down a level. There are doors that take you to new a new level of a deck and transporters take you to a new deck. Each droid is on high alert for any intruders so you must shoot them a number of times while avoiding getting shot or touching the droids. Each time you are hit by a droid or shot then you lose part of an energy gauge and if this runs out then it is game over.\n\nScattered over the ship are computer terminals which you can access and give you various choices in your quest to shutdown each deck. You can see a map of the whole ship and it's decks which leads to a map of the levels of the deck you are on. You can play a little arcade game to give you full energy which has you trying to get a cursor from the top to the bottom of a box though gaps in bars moving left or right. If you touch a bar then you lose a life out of five and if all lives are gone then all terminals on the deck cannot be used to gain energy. Your final option is the shutdown of the actual deck which can only be accessed when you have destroyed enough droids. It is a mastermind type game where you have a five rows of five columns and you have to turn on the circles in the correct pattern. Once you try the first row the computer tells you how many are correct but you lose energy for every wrong guess. Guess the pattern correctly and you can move to the next deck but you can access the game again when you have had five guesses.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLWOwnL1lYU","Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"John Morrison","Publisher":"J.

Once you have both chosen your territories you can then allocate an extra 26 armies with up to nine added to a territory. You and the computer now take it in turns to attack either the other players army or a neutral territory by selecting the territory they want to attack. Once the result is known and who ever wins the battle can then decide how many armies to place in the new territory.

The combination puts pressure on you, from front, back and the side.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzfBjl-yYmo","Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Llamasoft Ltd.","Publisher":"Salamander","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"6e2eb9a9-47f1-44e1-8c80-300f816850cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"70d9856d-702e-4200-9d6c-53bac689f9e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"7cdbbe43-6697-4568-8bb3-c2d6e55baace.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"e182a795-fe6a-4257-9c90-fac6363a263e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"fb02c2ff-55fe-4505-be22-3150fcc3d2db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"88540739-adbd-43ca-87fa-a454fb758eeb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164952,"FileName":"ae7b01d2-a5ea-49dc-bfb2-869cdc4ed327.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164952,"AlternateName":"Grid Runner","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":136181,"Name":"Halcon","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Halcon by Jordi Palet is a Spanish clone of Sega's Arcade game Zaxxon.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Cibercomp S.A.","Publisher":"Cibercomp S.A.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":136181,"FileName":"63a0051c-3735-4793-a283-6f5bda30a612.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":136181,"FileName":"c07d6c8a-1026-4b1d-9abe-52b4f0fc2eec.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136181,"FileName":"51d3b49f-b687-488e-86de-636b55000dfe.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136181,"FileName":"6cf2f4d1-d55b-4672-a1a1-0ca0c0c1add4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136181,"FileName":"e5862af5-ee86-47b6-b2c6-027282715cc1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136181,"FileName":"da692916-6d34-4d12-942c-5c460b9a9b69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136133,"Name":"Hunchback","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Hunchback was published by Ocean Software in 1984 for the Dragon 32, and it was a port from the original arcade version which was developed by Century Electronics in 1983.

Each level of the game takes place on a Castle Wall and the player must control the hunchback across the screen from left to right whilst avoiding various obstacles in order to ring the bell at the far right of the screen. Successfully ringing the bell brings the player to the next level. Obstacles include fire pits which must be swung over on a long rope; castle ramparts which must be jumped across (some of which contain knights jutting spears at the Hunchback); flying fireballs and arrows. In addition, another knight attempts to climb up the castle wall to reach the hunchback. Eventually, after completing a number of levels, the player must rescue Esmeralda.

The clowns however are not happy and soon they begin throwing things back.\n\nBy controlling Arnold, the player must navigate around the play area avoiding angry clowns and hitting them with pies to collect points. Clowns will attack by throwing juggling clubs and if hit by a clown or club will be sent to the First Aid tend and loose a life. Three trips to First Aid and it's game over (extra visits awarded for each 10,000 points scored).\n\nArnold also has a food meter to keep an eye on which must be replenished to keep him moving. Picking up burgers, fries and shakes are just what he needs but overfeeding is just as bad as under feeding however and if the meter gets too low or high he will slow to half speed.\n\nThere are six main rooms in the game which can be left when the doors become open, some rooms are Random Challenge rooms and have no pies to pick up for ammunition. If you can get out without getting caught you are awarded big bonus points. Also, after every 20,000 points you can exit into the Mudslinging Round, here the clowns are stationary and do not attack but are still deadly if ran into.\n\nThe game has support for two players with play alternating between each life lost.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175423,"FileName":"8e0322a6-f4f5-4b76-b770-4610b65e66f6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175423,"FileName":"180f22fe-7096-40b2-b8d2-0ceba797f0fa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175423,"FileName":"e13aad32-942b-4fd0-b52e-4806d812173a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175423,"FileName":"44b4a03e-786a-43ae-b514-9c5e4ffb5de9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175423,"FileName":"f0931030-8c80-4ab0-866f-afa2f0fb1af7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175776,"Name":"North Sea Oil","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Real life simulation game.

But just as he gets successful, a company tries to sue him out - the court date is in ten days and he has to prove his ownership of the planet. Now the player has to go there to find the needed documents.\n\nThe goal of the game is to use five mobiles to find items and use them in the right spot. This is made more difficult by the time limit (indicated with the day-night rhythm) and the big free-roaming world. Every mobile has different abilities, e.g. repairing, and attributes which allow them to travel through places the others can't pass. The action comes into play because the player directly controls the mobiles and has to evade the defenses built up by the company. Initially only one mobile can protect itself; the other ones have to find certain crystals and learn how to use them.\n\nThe player can instantly switch between the mobiles. This is not only needed to solve puzzles, but also because all mobiles (including the opponent's) run out of energy when used. The only way to recharge is to spend time with another mobile - but the time does not stop for the unused mobiles, so it is advised to park them at a save location. Some parts of the game take place underground, e.g. in mines.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175418,"FileName":"846cd299-88b6-4e1e-be5d-5bc3fdd80b58.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175418,"FileName":"bddb9f4e-fa72-489d-8d34-46dbf8e1483b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175701,"Name":"Tank Commander","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175701,"FileName":"173c649b-afcf-417a-9922-12d927e56562.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175801,"Name":"Tea Time","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175801,"FileName":"283816a1-e4e3-4fec-ad41-7b3546204f62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175801,"FileName":"8ac9ec2c-69f1-4171-9696-df8a5502453f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175801,"FileName":"e7422edb-8125-4eba-8ca3-835829b78598.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175702,"Name":"Tee Off","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175702,"FileName":"3328e861-8f4d-4ef6-a9ac-5d66740132ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171187,"Name":"The 6809 Express","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Quickbeam Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"25ab56e5-0f1d-47e7-b675-b9622aa96d08.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"e1a14c9c-640f-4367-9824-1e091b115d55.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"1a4565ed-94a9-47a8-940f-29e51e61201d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"cbce6285-7c0b-455d-a87a-a5a0cbf4ec78.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"c46126e8-3b18-4899-bb07-5c082015ecbf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"8c907674-91e4-46e4-ac6d-9cfd839f368e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"bf578ef8-6332-4870-9b56-505f0f6ec6c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171187,"FileName":"d67513e2-9190-407d-aefa-3870a6e1910b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137096,"Name":"The Bells","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Written by Drew Marshall, this is a fairly close copy of Ocean/Century's arcade platformer, Hunchback.

The batsman can control the angle and height of the bat as well as his position on the crease.\n\nIf the ball is hit or missed without hitting the stumps or a LBW, the view switches to a top down view of the pitch showing the position of all the fielders. Here the batsman can decide to run or the nearest fielder to the ball can be controlled.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175710,"FileName":"a9846566-c5fe-427d-8313-d7530032e003.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175710,"FileName":"415724f8-79e4-428d-bf10-f4aa4980d5ff.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175710,"FileName":"16b7500d-92e0-42ed-a4ef-446e862afee2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175710,"FileName":"ed448c2c-f996-44ef-b482-375cd55d1314.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175710,"FileName":"70f45982-6d6b-4dc1-8c84-1c4a35ecfa52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175427,"Name":"Time Bandit","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.\n\nHaving nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced preview of the concept getting famous with Gauntlet two years later. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.\n\nEach of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).\n\nInterestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction.\n\nGaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Tutankham, Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"MichTron","Publisher":"Microdeal","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175427,"FileName":"cd4a2d1b-dcfd-4f30-8a59-484a973540e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175427,"FileName":"c203d0b3-5c59-43fc-8cf0-1307516d7f99.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175698,"Name":"Toppler","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175698,"FileName":"9693f542-f36d-48f8-a8d1-339188304a63.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175698,"FileName":"b8de6239-1d4d-45b4-b607-e6421a497ff7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175698,"FileName":"12bd168b-9d4a-4069-859b-8fde3c151a85.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196716,"Name":"Total Eclipse","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Total Eclipse takes its basic concept from Elite (which was never ported to the Dragon) but moves focus from real-time space flight to the trading and navigation aspects.\nThe game is played through a series of graphical menus, joined by 3D and 2D action sequences.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Flight Simulator; Strategy","Developer":"Fenmar","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196716,"FileName":"b7e35dbf-fcfd-447c-8511-f1a0e2b058c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196716,"FileName":"d61f1b72-2b20-4819-9a1c-47c03e9bb6f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175697,"Name":"Touchstone","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175697,"FileName":"c600c58e-2377-4ad8-bcf1-be91970d8e2f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175697,"FileName":"b1841290-323b-4194-97be-ce64a15396e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175697,"FileName":"7d164189-676c-4f42-9019-1ca207387b74.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175785,"Name":"Trace Race","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcB8TlFUXow","Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Cable Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175785,"FileName":"96b83b53-b9ed-4ab8-847a-fd6db621dc22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175785,"FileName":"d6aaae40-29f0-4f8e-9a13-4a7bad9b0526.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175785,"FileName":"33658249-3f0c-422e-afac-03efdcf0c63b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175785,"AlternateName":"Trace Racers","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":175572,"Name":"Transylvanian Tower","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Transylvanian Tower is a single player maze game in which the player must explore five levels of Count Kreepie's castle, kill him, and find his stash of loot. The castle has over five hundred different rooms to explore. Some contain items that can be used but the inventory is limited to only three items at any one time, and this includes weapons, so it's wise to collect just what's important. The items/weapons available are: the golden ring, an invisible cloak, a magic apple, a special floor plan, a clove of garlic, a mirror, a knife, a dagger, a sword, a silver cross and your gun - which is limited to 10 shots. If the player is killed at any time on level 2 and beyond, the game is over and they are returned to the start of level one.\n\nLevel 1:\nThis is an exploration level. A floor plan may be obtained at any time by pressing the 'h' key.\n\nLevel 2:\nOn this level the player will encounter bats and objects. Bats are bad things and must be killed. If enough bats are killed the player will be transported to level 3. If insufficient bats are killed the player will be transported to a random room on level 2. There are sealed rooms and it is possible to be transported into one. Fortunately one of the objects encountered is a magic ring that allows the player to move through two walls, so it is advisable to carry this to avoid having to replay the game. The 'h' key can again be used to view the floor plan, but this time it's only available when a bat has been killed.\n\nLevels 3 & 4:\nThese play as level 2 but all bats must be shot through the heart.\n\nLevel 5:\nThis is where the evil Count Kreepie resides. Only one of the items you come across will kill the count. This, as the game says, \"will force you to find all the objects so you can try them out\". After killing the count you will receive a map showing where his treasure is, but you must still fight the bats on the way there.\n\nThe game can be saved when necessary, but only after thirty minutes of gameplay. Control is by cursor only. Keys 5-8 move the player in the appropriate direction, key 6 rotates the character 90 degrees to the left, so pressing the 6 key twice means you're retracing your steps. Transfer between levels can take up to two minutes because a new maze is generated for each game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"d5c25f7b-0695-46c0-b11a-16764f511bec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"127eca15-780e-4f2d-82d6-f0300aea9a8f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"930c05ea-c243-4f59-8d0a-c13a8f8a2fcf.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"347d513c-bf34-4d55-915b-5bd1605b532e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"32f3d4bb-de53-4da9-b687-9df1c8e8df7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"28df644a-f70c-4a93-ab77-c299369b1ba7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175572,"FileName":"4e8aa7b3-bbaf-4900-83e4-c72818a5f6d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175420,"Name":"Trekboer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You find yourself in command of the starship Trekboer as your adventure begins.

The amount of reels in the video machine is equal to three for ZX Spectrum, BBC / Electron and Dragon 32/64 versions, and to four for other versions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Mastertronic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175414,"FileName":"fc8f985c-3226-444c-b2b5-da1bc03f6290.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175414,"FileName":"d048ba22-3629-4a4a-825a-a5f8eb3458ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175414,"FileName":"e320d588-7ec6-4243-b691-6dbfa30f1975.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175414,"FileName":"b86a01b3-a317-4d73-ad1f-7ce2ab1b420d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175414,"FileName":"2aac07ce-46ff-4f24-8070-7a38f95f1ee3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175414,"FileName":"9c2eb35f-8c52-47f7-a1bb-647529eb050d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175690,"Name":"Viking","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175690,"FileName":"0cc24e15-1c11-4477-9a81-b378c363ec7f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":175690,"FileName":"37c3236e-839b-4c93-9022-a2cf7277e3ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":175690,"FileName":"1dc7824f-e171-4691-b741-6979a640727d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":175690,"FileName":"67521b91-280a-4e7f-afe1-e181f4fe78aa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175690,"FileName":"094f4f34-63d5-4bc2-b98c-6b30f75ae78c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175690,"FileName":"9ae02a0e-be48-4160-915a-fd98cfa3b837.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165124,"Name":"Volcanic Dungeon","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"After a terrible confrontation between forces of evil from another universe and the elves, dwarves, and animals, the seeds of the mother of all trees were lost. The only being knowing where to find the seeds, without which nothing will grow, is the elfin princess Edora. Your task is to find and rescue the princess from the Volcanic Dungeon, where the witch Magra, the last member of the evil alliance, holds her captive.\n\nVolcanic Dungeon has the same basic gameplay as a Rogue-like dungeon crawler, but with a text adventure interface. You start the game at an unidentified spot in the dungeon, and must find your way using a map in the manual. The dungeon is filled with fiery pits and wandering monsters. In the different chambers, you find weapons and equipment necessary to fight the enemy. All the while, you must manage your water supply (if you manage to find the princess, it diminishes twice as fast). A magic ring displayed on-screen tells you how strong the witch is.\n\nAll controls use single keys and your inventory is also displayed as single letters, just as in Hack and similar games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Carnell Software Ltd","Publisher":"Carnell Software Ltd","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"699eccd6-1f2d-41a4-8470-be8eef54b069.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"cf472f60-6b44-4a31-9c3b-3a21276069fe.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"b9c00858-1e4b-4369-b981-fd089eda74e5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"bbb54bac-4189-40a4-91b9-707d64e6c589.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"111cb86b-5d6b-485b-87b5-6f05cf7cb907.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"c75669cd-037a-4cbc-bf9e-f44585dc86ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"444b57d8-363a-4beb-9a15-fb74c2dc5171.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165124,"FileName":"fa196537-0b42-48cc-a964-0aa0e4835c9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175689,"Name":"Vulcan Noughts and Crosses","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A three dimensional game of noughts and crosses or one or two players.Also includes a zero player option where the machine plays itself.\nCan you out think your Dragon?","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175689,"FileName":"c972703f-2cc1-490c-963b-a0a818679805.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175689,"FileName":"ebd1b3d1-0ad7-4985-a3e8-190d4b42236e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175689,"FileName":"a86543cc-d93a-45fa-ae5b-3a9b9b30b124.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175689,"FileName":"4f271b99-fcff-4dba-8a2e-4c88654437de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175688,"Name":"Vultures","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Vultures is an original (?) shoot'em'up with a slight Galaga flavour.

In steep climbs the view/head angle is adjusted (to a limit) to try and keep the horizon visible.\n\nThe Worlds are called: Mountain World #1, Arabian Gulf, Panama City, Dahlgren VA, Practice Field, Mountain World #2, Island Bay, Mountain World #3, Power Line River. The airport scenery is loaded whenever you get close enough, below the ceiling/400ft and about 4000ft from the runway threshold.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Tom Mix Software","Publisher":"Microdeal","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"8c2c2709-1196-4a8f-bbab-15770e99a046.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"7960e5e3-a550-40a8-bb4c-aad0ac0b035f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"2266a8e4-7600-4595-abf9-ffd8a6a89a1d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"3cc7664a-f52c-4a9a-9122-c0140d4e8a1d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"7de00754-a43c-4086-a3a7-1abab709c101.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"1df0322e-15f2-41df-ae57-b1f9061c58bc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"4f473811-abb5-4778-b687-97932ff4e4dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"c99ee801-8140-4579-b890-2f4da2f7f3fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136163,"FileName":"63b42af3-e86e-4012-b879-24631c1eb358.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175639,"Name":"Zak'sSon","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"With a name like that, what can one expect, save an isometric shooter with heavy Zaxxon influences? Yet, even though Zak's Son makes no attempt to hide its influences, it doesn't slavishly mimic its role model. Unlike Zaxxon, you are flying a helicopter, and this game entirely lacks the concept of height above ground. Any shots fired will hit whatever it crosses, be it on ground or airbourne. You also have your fuel level to keep an eye on. By shooting canisters marked with an F, you replenish your dwindling fuel supply. Failure to do so results in game over, and so does the loss of your three lives. The game plays entirely in black and white high resolution mode.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Dragon 32/64","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Knight Soft","Publisher":"Cable Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"601395cd-f681-4107-851c-67cae91a6a7c.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"290b8352-c5ab-40b5-8603-20f931adf2d3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"c8e9226f-aa9a-4f39-a736-a3ceaa4b8842.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"a2feac98-9787-4080-bcab-36da7958fe26.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"33d02fa6-cf1f-441d-a327-ed2149af5cd2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"bf3ba197-d716-420d-8104-0b4645dfee0e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175639,"FileName":"b8d8a839-a085-4645-ba66-7b7a12301658.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175639,"AlternateName":"Zak's Son","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":164614,"Name":"Zorakk the Conqueror","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Journey through the medieval lands of Ramagora in search of the three pieces of the long lost crown of Ultimate Darkness.
