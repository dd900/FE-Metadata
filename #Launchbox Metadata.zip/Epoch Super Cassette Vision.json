Building on the prototypical action role-playing elements of Panorama Toh (1983), created by Yoshio Kiya and Nihon Falcom, as well as Namco's The Tower of Druaga (1984), Dragon Slayer is often considered the first true action role-playing game. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, Dragon Slayer was a dungeon crawl role-playing game that was entirely real-time with action-oriented combat, combining arcade style action mechanics with traditional role-playing mechanics.\n\nDragon Slayer featured an in-game map to help with the dungeon-crawling, required item management due to the inventory being limited to one item at a time, and featured item-based puzzles similar to The Legend of Zelda. Dragon Slayer's overhead action-RPG formula was used in many later games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk55fmsQiTE","Platform":"Epoch Super Cassette Vision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Publisher":"Epoch Co.

The shaft is divided in a multitude of floors, connected by lifts. Both you and your enemies may use the lifts, using them both to advance, to escape and to ambush. The enemies have different behaviours, with some rushing toward you and some shooting. Traps include grappling claws and lasers in the ceilings and electrical floors. For defence, you have a gun.\n\nWhile your character can jump across gaps in the floor, he is not an invincible platform hero and will die from falling through the floor. One way to cross a wider gap in the floor is to use a transport rail in the ceiling, something which requires precision. In order to complete a section of the shaft, you must collect the necessary keys, so you cannot rush through a section, thereby avoiding enemy contact.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOgMoRFT8Y","Platform":"Epoch Super Cassette Vision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Shooter","Developer":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"84e8e0f1-64e8-42ba-8990-0e5fc8cc78eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"2b91c851-3e8c-4b9e-8d5d-6fc317a1ebfb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"c0236068-9cda-4bbb-a559-d9c6122fd581.jpg","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"9ae75f9c-027e-4f1b-8339-e762d02924bd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"3df1e3d0-061e-4bd0-bf9d-0b0b47dba9dc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"fb5ad227-0e28-47b8-ab67-feb29b70afad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"8613e1c7-097c-45be-9d03-36822850d25f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":125569,"FileName":"beee1b02-9569-4426-8157-4d040035017d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126934,"Name":"Giants Hara Tatsunori no Super Baseball","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Epoch Super Cassette Vision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Epoch","Publisher":"Epoch","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126934,"FileName":"d4b73295-22c0-4401-b820-51e92e0afa13.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":126934,"FileName":"0b85136c-792f-400a-b428-fbd311a6ef13.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163765,"Name":"Lupin III","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lupin III is an Action game, developed and published by Epoch, which was released in Japan in 1984.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Epoch Super Cassette Vision","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Epoch","Publisher":"Epoch","ReleaseDate":"1984-01-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163765,"FileName":"6e9e95c3-cb63-4238-9837-2d4b1583b03e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163765,"FileName":"d8533258-e359-4c0d-ab5e-fe26f2772a2b.PNG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163765,"FileName":"7c1e760d-0951-4909-97e0-8dd81ec7e5b6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163765,"FileName":"8a1339cd-283d-4cc2-a7d3-1376ca0052ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163765,"FileName":"0362bd52-04de-478c-b7bb-ee8f653579b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":163765,"AlternateName":"Rupan Sansei","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":163765,"AlternateName":"Lupin Sansei","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163962,"Name":"Mappy","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"You control Mappy, a police-mouse whose job is to collect valuables (consumer electronics) from a cat's house.

To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.\n\nYou can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JvURgyA_UM","Platform":"Epoch Super Cassette Vision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Namcot","Publisher":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125580,"FileName":"997b3ed5-2442-4c7a-a21b-bfbb9d91faca.jpg","Type":"Box -
