Building on the prototypical action role-playing elements of Panorama Toh (1983), created by Yoshio Kiya and Nihon Falcom, as well as Namco's The Tower of Druaga (1984), Dragon Slayer is often considered the first true action role-playing game. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, Dragon Slayer was a dungeon crawl role-playing game that was entirely real-time with action-oriented combat, combining arcade style action mechanics with traditional role-playing mechanics.\n\nDragon Slayer featured an in-game map to help with the dungeon-crawling, required item management due to the inventory being limited to one item at a time, and featured item-based puzzles similar to The Legend of Zelda. Dragon Slayer's overhead action-RPG formula was used in many later games.","Publisher":"Epoch Co.

The shaft is divided in a multitude of floors, connected by lifts. Both you and your enemies may use the lifts, using them both to advance, to escape and to ambush. The enemies have different behaviours, with some rushing toward you and some shooting. Traps include grappling claws and lasers in the ceilings and electrical floors. For defence, you have a gun.\n\nWhile your character can jump across gaps in the floor, he is not an invincible platform hero and will die from falling through the floor. One way to cross a wider gap in the floor is to use a transport rail in the ceiling, something which requires precision. In order to complete a section of the shaft, you must collect the necessary keys, so you cannot rush through a section, thereby avoiding enemy contact.","Publisher":"Epoch Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HjOgMoRFT8Y"},"125570":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Kung-Fu Road","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Epoch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"acb55890-edc9-4f37-88d0-c1e83d0de63e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd9faaed-f389-4123-9069-4b8664687c71.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e8c92557-9e8e-4ceb-8512-91baf0e36cf3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"00c69735-4f45-4640-a083-26f7b5ce481c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ab031581-99db-4ded-93e9-6c0325c5e5bf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"531547b2-9e28-4296-a99a-4397cf58333d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ce38bdef-b2fb-483b-a89c-9e03cadec395.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nekketsu Kung-Fu Road","Publisher":"Epoch Co.
