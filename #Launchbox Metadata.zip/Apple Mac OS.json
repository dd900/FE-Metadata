To escape, the player must earn 10,000,000 points in a single run through the dungeon. While in the dungeon, the character moves forward on their own, facing monsters and collecting treasure, but their progress is set by the player as they slide rows or columns of icons to match three similar ones, generating melee and magic attacks, loot, keys, and other resources. These resources can be used to level up the character, which can impact how the sliding puzzle is played and its results on the dungeon run.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPlkZRqnxUQ","Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"EightyEight Games","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-01-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25604,"FileName":"4f69f20c-ac64-45d5-bf4e-a66514823d6c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179714,"Name":"1893: A World's Fair Mystery","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"1893: A World's Fair Mystery is a historical mystery text-based adventure game using very detailed factual information regarding the famous 1893 World's Fair.

However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.\n\nPool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.\n\nExploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also \"multi-class\" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"1290885e-229a-48e4-b1f8-bfca76b45bcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"fd1fd5d5-d2be-469c-b680-d9cb6ca5e646.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"d7dd6135-f9f1-4179-917b-b80124919fee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"884a4a28-53d1-43a6-a6f2-a997aecc9ef5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"d727d205-2345-4a64-be40-bf483c30480c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"61db3bbd-68f1-4114-9e24-b013fd88308e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"60b17a7c-4620-446a-b6a7-8225e6068c81.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"102fd90d-f57c-408b-b6d8-25fdf3b24651.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"798ebd1a-5e13-4472-9865-821228ecc7c1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"b1c1b90f-c493-4a5f-a859-2bd5ebd28335.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177368,"FileName":"1ad408f5-3445-4e39-ae35-b690a6bedf03.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":177368,"AlternateName":"Pool of Radiance","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":179766,"Name":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Secret of the Silver Blades","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"The heroes from Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds return once again.

Following the AD&D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. Unlike the previous games, there is no \"world map\" traveling in Secret of the Silver Blades. All the exploration takes place in the 3D world.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179766,"FileName":"54719e34-91e1-4c8e-826d-149f6f012b7b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179766,"FileName":"e02853ee-ac26-41b8-bfdb-08b9c3437f24.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179766,"FileName":"7cb1fcc5-da73-4f8c-83fb-664eedc57a06.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179766,"FileName":"e774d919-7d1e-4a48-b890-7bafb5de41e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179766,"FileName":"33f7f59a-7a77-449f-ad17-1be952e8cb42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179766,"AlternateName":"Secrret of the Silver Blades","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":201548,"Name":"Adventure at the Chateau d'Or","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A beautiful princess has chosen you to solve the mystery of a castle named \"Chateau d'Or\" - \"The Golden Castle\".

Grab the cola, cupcakes, ice cream, and hula-hoops while avoiding spiders, broccoli, frogs, and mean sisters. Each platform you land on grabs you one point, but watch your yukk-o-meter!\n\nFish Shtick: Unscramble the letters before the clock reaches 0! Collect as many points as you can and get a high score! One point for four-letter words, two for 5-letter words, three for 6-letter words, etc.\n\nRoof Rats: Get everyone off the roof and leave yourself with as few rooms remaining as possible. Eliminate rooms by putting two-or-more of the same colour together and double-clicking. Each person has their own number of floors that they can jump off of. The grannie has to be on ground level, the rat can jump off of 1 floor, the dog - 2 floors, the pogo-boy - 3 floors, the boxing kangaroo - 4 floors, the buff man - 5 floors.\n\nSolitaire: No twists here, just a simple game of Klondike.\n\nRoger Dodger: You control a glowing orb that needs to collect power-ups (green) and then make its way to the pulsing green gateway. Avoid red things; they'll kill you!\n\nZapper: Standard trivia; yes-or-no questions. Every time you get three-in-a-row correct and your time will increase, as well as the jackpot (third) point level.\n\nMowin' Maniac: Can you say Pac-Man? That's all this game is: a variant with a lawnmower theme.\n\nBad Dog 911: Using six letters, create as many words as you can before time runs out! Every \"real\" word will move the scaffolding closer to you, but the clock is ticking! When it's half-past and you haven't gotten the scaffolding yet, you die!\n\nToaster Run: Ah, the little toaster that was the first in a series of infamous screen savers. Now the little toaster is on a mission to gather all the toys and put the child in bed. Hitting an object causes the toaster to lose power; bread increases it. Watch out for the TV! The static really hurts!\n\nFoggy Boxes: Dots in disguise. Unfortunately, you can only play against the computer.\n\nMooShu: The classic game of MahJongg, carried all the way from China! Select two tiles of matching design that are free on either the left or right and they disappear!

They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time).

The main portion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to prevent the 2012 apocalypse.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Ezio's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Ezio is able to freely explore 16th-century Rome to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game introduced a multiplayer component to the series, portrayed as a Templar training program.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim along with multiple awards including a BAFTA award for Best Action Game. It was followed in November 2011 by Assassin's Creed: Revelations, a direct sequel that served as a conclusion to Ezio's story and continued the story of Desmond Miles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Stealth","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-22T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8171,"FileName":"1e1955f1-ef0a-44e6-bb8f-5e4e783c3aab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8171,"FileName":"aef95cef-9af6-41de-bd3b-ee922f4a4651.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8171,"FileName":"591995dd-346c-4943-a5aa-fb54c7256ba9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8171,"FileName":"b30509c3-8c9e-42cc-8f8d-9e6bd1b66a1a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201930,"Name":"Astérix: Caesar's Challenge","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"This interactive board game offers action and adventure as Asterix and his friends journey around the Roman Empire on a challenge from Caesar while learning about different countries' history and culture.

These 5 are: Swamp, Black Forest, East Labyrinth, West Labyrinth, and Black Knight's Showdown & The Final Battle. There are different enemies and items such as multiple keys and a helicopter pack which lets you fly in the Swamp and Black Forest levels. You must pick up Gas to use it also. The game map is larger with longer levels. Different elements present include weapons-based fighting, mazes, bombs which are used to destroy enemies or walls, and a health system. \n\nSome enemies will decrease your health when hitting you instead of killing you outright.

The player controls Tim during his search for a princess he has known and lost. Although the objective appears to be rather straightforward at first, the meaning and the motives become much more implicit and are interwoven with the mechanics during the course of the game. From a main hub, Tim can eventually access six worlds that consist of different areas. The start of each world reveals a part of the Tim's background and emotions, rather than progressing a storyline. The second to the sixth world can be entirely explored without solving all the puzzles. Difficult situations can be ignored and revisited later. When all worlds have been completed, the first one becomes available and brings closure to the story.\n\nThe game's concept is entirely based around time manipulation. Tim cannot die permanently as the player can rewind time at any moment and usually for any length, even all the way back when an area was entered. While rewinding, the music is synchronized in a similar fashion. Rather than a gimmick, rewinding is an essential element to solve the puzzles. The different worlds give a spin to the mechanic by introducing clones as the player collaborates in a parallel reality with a past version of himself, time can be affected through the movement direction, and Tim can create a circular area to cause time dilation. Certain items, enemies and parts of the scenery are immune to time manipulation or behave in a very different way. Puzzles require close examination of the environment and the behaviour of different items and enemies. As such, the game is entirely about solving the puzzle theoretically by applying the game mechanics and then using trial and error to executive it and discover possible flaws in the proposed logic. This also brings limited replayability to the game.\n\nA world is solved by collecting the puzzle pieces. These need to be arranged and eventually show a picture related to the game's story. There is no filler in the level design, meaning that every platform, item or game element (except for a few enemies) has a specific purpose to solve a puzzle. Fast times can be tracked in a separate speedrun mode.\n\nThe later released Windows and Macintosh versions are identical, but come with a level editor.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-05-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15330,"FileName":"090daeb7-a0cf-407b-8a10-17381ad92b25.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15330,"FileName":"07c36c4b-51c8-4ddb-aaa9-d8b652125c41.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201595,"Name":"Brataccas","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Brataccas is a game that combines exploration, puzzle-solving and combat.

While testing the product Morlock inexplicably finds himself in the spaceship within the game. A hyperspace accident clones him thirty times. Each of the clones departs, taking with him a portion of a vital fluid that sustains Morlock's life. Assuming the persona of the brave Captain Blood, the programmer tracks down and disintegrated twenty-five clones, spending 800 years to achieve that goal. However, five clones still remain, hidden somewhere in the depths of the galaxy. Captain Blood must find these clones and destroy them before he loses his own life.\n\nCaptain Blood is an open-ended first-person adventure game. Much of the game consists of traveling to various planets and communicating with the aliens there to gather clues concerning the clones' whereabouts. The player commands a biological ship called Ark, and must launch probes onto planet surfaces, successfully navigating them through the landscape to locate an alien. The Ark can also scan planets and sometimes teleport aliens to different locations.\n\nConversations with the aliens are conducted via the so-called UPCOM interface. Over 150 icons are available to represent different concepts. Since each alien speaks his own language, the player must input various combinations of the icons to be able to understand the alien and communicate with him. Successfully concluding conversations may offer clues or unlock other planets. The protagonist's health deteriorates over the time, which affects the game's interface by making it more difficult to control. These symptoms may be reverted by disintegrating a clone.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Exxos","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183813,"FileName":"369b3959-ab02-4af9-9707-9c6db2b8e293.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":183813,"FileName":"4c3e1734-010c-4e52-94aa-82a33c0da34e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183813,"FileName":"11920b3b-a133-4860-84a4-aa86bf17ce73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201600,"Name":"Carrier Command","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"Carrier Command is a cross between a vehicle simulation game and a real-time strategy game where players control a robotic aircraft carrier.

Gameplay is comprised of two parts, a strategic portion where players make business decisions about purchases, quest for new recipes, and travel the globe; and a minigame portion where newly-discovered chocolates are created.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Action; Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Big Splash Games","Publisher":"PlayFirst","ReleaseDate":"2007-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":201606,"FileName":"612ccb42-dd21-493c-b681-8895db334d6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201606,"FileName":"dcc7bc31-7eb9-40c2-832a-6cf8c1974433.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201606,"FileName":"2c2d2bd2-4f81-4f6a-bbbd-beb9e1bead0a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201606,"FileName":"f1e10f53-eb58-42f1-9d67-53662cca3ffa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201606,"FileName":"9e077166-0289-4849-b6a7-79d7936369d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201606,"FileName":"91f35f8e-8161-43eb-a7a3-a3b8a77a96b6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201607,"Name":"Chocolatier 2: Secret Ingredients","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Several years ago, you helped Evangeline Baumeister to save her family's chocolate business.

This time, in addition to chocolate squares, you can make sauces, truffles, pralines and more. Travel the globe looking for ingredients and recipes. Be sure to buy at the best rates you can to stretch every dollar. Once you have your ingredients, head to the factory to mix up some chocolate. This is done in a mini-game where you launch the ingredients towards the correct compartments on the machine. Do this as quickly and accurately as you can to get your output levels high. Later recipes will be more complex, making this task harder. Once the chocolate is made, it is time to sell it for a profit. As the game progresses, you can also buy other factories to increase your production and profits.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":" Action; Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Big Splash Games","Publisher":"PlayFirst","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":201607,"FileName":"f1f269d9-b303-4ee0-b5cc-e7a4db1b51cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201607,"FileName":"d94ca5d2-6b18-40f5-8696-857e9ca3069d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201607,"FileName":"d5593d9d-f61b-4316-acd7-06bd38bf3f6c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201607,"FileName":"3934bdfd-024d-493f-abe9-b45ddbafba9f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30345,"Name":"Chop Suey","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This colorful interactive storybook was designed for girls aged 7-12 but can be enjoyed by almost anyone.

As you found new cities and explore the surroundings, you may find hostile barbarians, villages, and other competing cultures. Once you have discovered another culture, you can adopt a policy of co-existence by signing a permanent peace treaty with that culture; you can even form a military alliance. But for those who like to conquer, you will find great satisfaction in deploying more than 50 different military units and crush your enemies. However, military is not the only aspect of this game. You will also need to concentrate on trade, science development, and make your people happy in order to avoid civil disorders.\n\nThroughout the game, you need to research technological advances, one after another, closely following the development of human civilization.

If there is an even larger creature above those two creatures, the larger creature will swallow them up immediately, resulting in something called a food chain, which gives the player more points. When a smaller creature hits another, larger, creature, the larger one swallows. After two creatures, the larger ones will eventually explode. If you make one creature eat another and give the larger one to an even larger one, the larger one will explode. \n\nBiggs also has a son, Smalls. He must provide for his son by barfing. In cooperative mode, the second player plays as Smalls.

But not only surviving the fall but also the plague Azra is now trapped in the Pit. Next to other survivors, the Pit is host to a number of dead plague victims, which have turned into invincible (and very Zombie like) revenants. While normally invincible, Azra has the unique ability in drawing other character into the so called \"half world\", where they can hurt those revenants. Unfortunately, while being in this \"half world\", the character cannot move from their positions and only attack in a radius around their position. And this is what constitutes the tower defence mechanic. \n\nOn her Journey through the Pit, Azra meets new friends and foes, discovers the true origin of the plague and what has happened in the pit ...\n\nThe gameplay is classic tower defence with a litte bit of RPG mechanics thrown in. The game has six different types of heroes (towers), which each again can be recruited up to six times. Those heroes, as well as Azra, can gain levels through XP. With each new level a skill point is available for distribution amongst several different stats, spells and abilities. The heroes can also equip a weapon and armor each to improve their combat prowess. Next to XP, each combat rewards the player with \"scraps\", which act as local currency to buy equipment and recruit new heroes. \n\nThe game does not have any random element in its battles. But each battle comes in four different difficulties and can be replayed at any time to gain the higher rewards with a more experienced party. Beating a level without any damage to Azra gives special bonuses like extra money or unique items.

Taking place (appropriately enough) in 1156 B.C., you play Ramose, a young Egyptian man who hopes to prove himself a worthy investigator for the current rulers of Egypt. Your first assignment is not an easy one, as a Tomb of Sethi I, a pharaoh has been desecrated and looted and your own father has been accused of the crime. You have three days to prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution.\n\nGameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of adventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to look at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a smooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives you a 'you are there' feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D rendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a reward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and puzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your inventory.\n\nIn addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes with reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture. These are available whenever you discover something interesting in the middle of the game or can be accessed via the main menu.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Education","Developer":"Cryo Interactive Entertainment","Publisher":"DreamCatcher Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201626,"FileName":"005deec7-24e4-4e8b-8e3a-3b346d91ffa3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":201626,"FileName":"340c8a72-2443-4267-a5ad-8b88475d82e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":201626,"FileName":"35865551-e433-4927-8d82-afe1071a8334.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":201626,"FileName":"43e2b0ff-e13b-49c1-ae57-6882d9d8ad12.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183819,"Name":"Enchanted Scepters","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"This is one of the few adventures created specifically for the Mac.

The player takes control of Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.\n\nFlashback: The Quest for Identity incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a \"cinematic platformer\" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.\n\nWhile a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.\n\nTo defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and complete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.\n\nMost of the versions utilize cutscenes with polygonal vector graphics. The CD versions replace those with pre-rendered 3D animations. The Sega CD version also features voice-overs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Delphine Software International","Publisher":"MacPlay","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"64a70f20-1157-4742-a490-69cc86d52d43.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"7a47a178-4752-4cd1-8f75-ea4bae2ee1b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"bc318db2-db38-452a-b169-e5f051c8aa1c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"d61af6ca-743a-491e-a5b4-2c1bd0276051.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"42d54ecf-8ccf-4d1a-9c8d-9d5d53dd87c5.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"dd493a34-cc32-4bdf-b0da-4c719973c98b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"ee66a18e-6a63-4b82-ba8e-64e57e12a33c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179723,"FileName":"f255d9b9-d2ee-4e59-afb5-2210e073d41b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179723,"AlternateName":"Flashback","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":201633,"Name":"Flight Commander 2","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"A tactical wargame focusing on air-to-air combat.

However, in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny, he was outgunned and had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Coarsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.\n\nFreddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click adventure game bearing many similarities to other Sierra titles in the same genre, in particular Leisure Suit Larry series.

He is the last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural forces of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.\n\nGabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g. Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games.\n\nThe game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically, Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.\n\nThe game's locations are done in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game adds full voice-overs to the dialogues, as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179645,"FileName":"b5dc02f7-93af-496c-a3ed-14d4bd234190.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179645,"FileName":"a5c46591-c46d-4c14-a0ff-2793c5ee375a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179645,"FileName":"9e821db4-f323-4070-a24b-949f68f44513.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179645,"FileName":"638b7a9d-f299-4239-b3ae-e34fd410901a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183822,"Name":"Galactic Core","ReleaseYear":"2001","Overview":"Galactic Core is a turn-based strategy game centered on the theme of space warfare.

The game features one island with a gas fuel station, an airport and a tank headquarter with the simple goal to destroy everything. Of course there is resistance: there are five jets and ten tanks on the island. Those only get active after the previous is destroyed and rise in difficulty - destroying the associated building takes care about all at once. The player has access to three weapons: an unlimited 30mm cannon, three heat-seeking rockets (effective against jets) and 16 heat bombs for defense against enemy rockets. After everything is destroyed, the jet has to safely return to base.\n\nAll this has to be completed before the jet fuel runs out, effectively giving the player only a few minutes to complete the goals. The main motivational factor is optimizing the high score because the effective measures (e.g. using the rockets or destroying the airport first) give much less points than the hard way. The player has various options for setting the game variables, e.g. difficulty or enemy behavior, but this prevents access to the high score list.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Tim Hays","Publisher":"Miles Computing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201664,"FileName":"6c10cfeb-242f-4e39-a995-570fd4aaccd2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201664,"FileName":"faf5ce84-5175-4f0a-831c-fc3dbd05c9f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201664,"FileName":"53bb528c-675d-495d-8284-5ea4ad972777.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201664,"FileName":"c0133891-1528-4122-a19d-55931947f2d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201664,"FileName":"dcf5709e-643b-42d6-b67c-74deae05327e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201665,"Name":"Headline Harry and the Great Paper Race","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"As a new reporter for Headline Harry, the editor of the US Daily Star, you must prove yourself by going out and getting the story fast and right.

The attacking forces follow certain paths and the player has to employ turrets in range of the enemy route (which changes between waves). The game features both land, air and sea enemy units. There are a few different turrets to choose from. Machine guns are good for light but fast units while cannons are slow and better suited for armored units. There are also sabotage turrets that slow down the enemies and comms that increases the performance of nearby turrets. For flying enemies anti-aircraft artillery is needed. The player earns money for destroying enemies and these can be used to upgrade and repair turrets. The enemies fire back at the turrets so repairs are necessary or they might be destroyed which is costly. \n\nThe game consists of two campaigns and quickplays. First the player takes control of the allies and once it's been completed the axis campaign is unlocked. The player earns victory points for every completed level and these can be used to unlock weapon upgrades.

The game reproduces many of the novel's scenes, few of which are interconnected in any way. The player assumes the role of John Blackthorne, pilot-major of the Dutch trading ship Erasmus. During a voyage in the Pacific Ocean in the year 1600, the Erasmus is shipwrecked in Japan. Blackthorne must survive in a land where every custom is as unfamiliar to him as the language. After learning some of the society's ways, he is drawn into a political struggle between warlords and falls in love with a Japanese woman.

The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.\n\nBuilding on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.\n\nWhile flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.\n\nWhile playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Cyberflix Incorporated","Publisher":"Paramount Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183830,"FileName":"af846b5c-0728-43ec-9092-995ce031ab38.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":183830,"FileName":"25aacf22-40f1-4313-ad59-d7823a3260e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183830,"FileName":"eee1cb58-6163-4130-a505-cbd17f90ab93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201683,"Name":"Jungle Park","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Jungle Park is a point and click adventure game that invites the player to explore the titular park.

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183831,"FileName":"24dfb256-430d-4a6b-92d4-901118de307c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":183831,"FileName":"0b8bffc4-08ff-43ef-ae51-96f8cb8381cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183831,"FileName":"b9482bbd-cec2-4819-ae8e-ec3ef0b77fa9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183831,"FileName":"bca5b09a-30c5-469a-9b20-ebaf52961a09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184509,"Name":"King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king.

As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184509,"FileName":"2595ae21-4cc4-412d-a21e-7742186882ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184509,"FileName":"7cdf25bd-4f52-4bd4-8f42-8934ba6d23a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184509,"FileName":"ba207dab-ec7c-4dab-b8f6-456d00db6292.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184512,"Name":"King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful.

Rosella is the chosen one.\n\nMeanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope.

When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.\n\nAs with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.

After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.\n\nLike its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs (\"walk\", \"examine\", \"use\", \"talk\", etc.).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184515,"FileName":"20f526e9-3a5f-4eaf-9979-a2ac4cf1c771.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184515,"FileName":"9876c262-e0a2-42fc-a420-7a3288d864fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184515,"FileName":"df3a2b04-efab-4e13-bc4e-6a4c47f953c2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184515,"FileName":"a0bd4ac8-8414-4362-9be0-ebd184664259.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201912,"Name":"King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Queen Valanice of Daventry has always thought that getting married would be the best course of action for her daughter Rosella.

The two end up in different parts of a land known as Eldritch, with Rosella being transformed into a troll.

The game is divided into chapters, alternating between the queen and the princess as protagonists. As opposed to the realistic drawing style of all the preceding game, it has brightly colored visuals reminiscent of Walt Disney cartoons.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201912,"FileName":"8f164f39-c0cd-4cd3-b3ff-5b28656b9449.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201912,"FileName":"f917e869-3bee-4dcc-959d-573b0c8d8744.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201912,"FileName":"d44ce740-5a03-427c-bb11-5665977dfa2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201912,"FileName":"ff04a03f-87e5-4092-840a-9ca882e09260.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184491,"Name":"King's Quest: Quest for the Crown","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Sir Graham is a brave knight who is sent on a quest to retrieve three treasures that were stolen by deception and stealth: a shield that protects its bearer from invaders, a mirror that foretells the future, and a treasure chest that is forever filled with gold. If Graham takes these treasures back to the royal castle, then the ailing King Edward the Benevolent of Daventry will hand over the crown. During his travels, Graham will meet characters that will either help or hinder him.\n\nKing's Quest is commonly considered the progenitor of third-person-perspective adventure games. As opposed to earlier graphic adventures, the player is able to navigate the protagonist on screen in eight directions, creating an effect of three-dimensional exploration. The player character can also be obscured from view when hiding behind an object, is subjected to gravity, and has different animations for actions such as picking up an item, falling, swimming, etc. Graham can be moved around with arrow keys and perform various actions when the player types commands, normally consisting of noun and verb combinations (e.g. \"Take flower\", \"Talk man\", etc.).\n\nThe game world consists of a cyclic outdoor area with places of interest (houses, characters, etc.) that must be found through exploration. Much of the kingdom is accessible to Graham from the beginning, and there are only a few restrictions imposed on traveling. In order to complete the game, the player has to procure certain items and use them in correct situations or with specific characters. Some of the puzzles rely on fairy tales, and a good knowledge of those makes them easier to solve.\n\nThe game awards the player points for most of the actions he makes Graham perform. Since some of those are not crucial to completion, it is quite possible to finish the game without having attained the full score. Some of the tasks in the game have multiple solutions, though the game may grant the player less points if he chooses the simpler one. Many hazards await Graham on his journey, and death is frequent if the player is not careful. The game can also be rendered unwinnable by failing to collect a specific item or wasting it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184491,"FileName":"53b63198-05fb-439b-a972-2c70d7cf4fc1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184491,"FileName":"60168ca4-74a9-4c23-91ed-a422902ceb34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201684,"Name":"Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom","ReleaseYear":"2001","Overview":"Knights & Merchants is a game very similar to Settlers II, and that's not really a coincidence, as they were made by the same lead programmer, who started his own company (Joymania).\n\nIn K&M you start building a base and gain resources, and after that you make an army and try to attack the enemy.

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008.\n\nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.\n\nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009.\n\nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2010-10-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8158,"FileName":"6f7df125-a219-4b51-923c-eca2820d5bb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8158,"FileName":"37c58611-cc9e-42a5-8752-0398c827566b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201690,"Name":"Legacy","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Legacy is a text adventure game with graphics where the player is Dagon Bathraal, a young magician who is sent on a mission by one of the Wizards of the Universe, a powerful organization of mystics.

The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?\n\nUnlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Use\" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to \"die\" in Larry 5, and the amount of \"dead ends\" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the \"right\" solution.

Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game.\n\nThe game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion. The game contains adult situations and semi-implicit depictions of sex.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184522,"FileName":"efe6bacb-b9f9-4ab3-8251-33db77853716.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184522,"FileName":"d08bc7be-2423-450d-bba3-e51a889c401a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184522,"FileName":"35333184-705b-4c87-94da-e3b100c2aebc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179665,"Name":"Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Love for Sail! is the sixth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series.

To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported and best-selling video games, and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports.

The player controls a protagonist simply known as the The Boy, who is said to enter the world Limbo in search of his sister. However, the story as a whole can also be seen as a metaphor for the search for companionship and getting around in a new environment. Not a single clue is given at the start, there are no cut-scenes and the game starts right away. In that world filled with hazards and danger, his means are few and he is extremely vulnerable. Only two buttons are used, a feeble jump and one to perform an action, combined with movement. This allows him to explore the world and hang on ledges, slide down slopes, push objects, pull levers, and cling to ropes, but the player has to make most of what is present in the environment to get by, often with physics-based elements.\n\nThe gloomy world has a dusty filter showing the game through misted glass, and no vivid colours are present. It is divided into 24 chapters that seamlessly flow into each other, only from the level selection in the main menu can be derived where a new chapter starts. The world is rendered in 2D but with different layers of depth in the scenery. It moves from a forest to an abandoned city and eventually an industrial zone. The player faces three kinds of challenges. There are obstacles where The Boy simply needs to find a way to progress, there are dangerous creatures that hunt him down and try to kill them, and finally there is a gang of children who band together to ward off the intruder and set up traps for him, with a touch of Lord of the Flies. Encounters with other humans are however brief and rare. These account for most of the horror moments, of the psychological kind, with other unnerving sequences like when the player is forced to use the corpses of other children as a bridge.\n\nMusic and sound effects are minimal and there are no on-screen elements referring to health or other statistics. Every single misstep, often with gruesome consequences, is fatal. In the same vein the boy cannot jump from great heights or jump very far. When dead, the game immediately reloads before the current puzzle. Most of the encounters are centered around puzzles and these are sometimes based on timing or speed when being chased. Other elements serve only for setting the scene, when The Boy gets to ride a boat to cross a lake (he cannot swim and drowns immediately) or finds the corpses of the people who did not make it in Limbo. Most of the game elements are discovered through experimentation, like the effects of a glowing worm that attaches itself to The Boy's head, changing the flow of gravity, or what happens when a giant spider captures him. There is only a single path through the levels and generally there is only a single solution to a problem.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":15761,"FileName":"69c6406e-93b6-48bc-bde0-f1924054bfab.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":15761,"FileName":"aa9bffb1-c7a3-4e47-9c11-999808b6418c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":15761,"FileName":"55bb0203-5482-432a-8cca-f9d21b9d31b7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201910,"Name":"Links Pro Macintosh","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Links 386 Pro is a golf simulation sports game for MS-DOS released in 1992.

Communities and states comprised of people united by a common trade were created. The Guild of Weavers has achieved such mastery in their trade that they discovered the secret of weaving the very fabric of reality. They were treated with suspicion by other guilds, who eventually accused them of practicing witchcraft and banned them to a secluded island, which they called Loom.\n\nBobbin Threadbare is a young man from the Guild of Weavers. He is outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times, though he does not know why. On his seventeenth birthday he is summoned by the Elders of the guild, who intend to decide his fate. However, shortly thereafter all the inhabitants of the village except Bobbin are turned into swans. Bobbin finds out that he is the child of the Great Loom, found by Lady Cygna, who tried to use the loom's powers to save the guild. Bobbin's stepmother Dame Hetchel teaches him the art of weaving magical drafts, and Bobbin embarks on a journey to find the lost flock, and the answers to his questions.\n\nLoom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called \"drafts\" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"2fc4d551-23ec-47b8-953d-25902cd008ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"834b8dfa-aaf6-45c4-9b5d-862ae62d108e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"fb4db03d-e795-4248-86f6-ad800d70a020.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"33122d99-5096-48f9-848b-ae34489d486f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"ef732468-b882-4e9a-89bd-ab034e541ebe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"75443648-5773-47a5-90d3-fb8e3ff665f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179666,"FileName":"9bf4d15d-def9-4259-99fe-f106007c9556.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201490,"Name":"Lunar Rescue","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Not to be confused with a Taito arcade cabinet with the same name, this is a Mac-exclusive game featuring artwork by Mike Saenz.\n\nThe moon's defense system has been sabotaged, causing it to fire on all ships trying to cross the supply lines between cities.

The player's weapons are relatively static throughout the game, including machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenade attacks. While in the vehicle, the player can opt to duck inside one of the buildings to find additional ammunition and supplies. Nearly all buildings (except for quest-specific ones) are identical.\n\nThe game's latter missions involve defending the moon base itself from attack by the alien forces, and then attacking the alien mothership.\n\nThe player's activities are seen from a first person perspective, but they can only face one of four directions, turning left or right on a tile-based grid similar to games such as Scarab of Ra. Direct targeting is accomplished with the mouse, while movement is accomplished with either the mouse or the game's heads up display.\n\nThe game included several pre-rendered full motion video sequences, usually bookending the combat sequences.

Maelstrom was released when there were few action games for the high-resolution color displays of the Macintosh, so it garnered much interest, despite the dated concept, and led to the creation of Ambrosia Software.\n\nThe game was later released as free and open-source software, resulting in ports for other platforms.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/stxgF2fBq9c","Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Andrew Welch","Publisher":"Ambrosia Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182116,"FileName":"8f99566f-fee0-4634-b340-9472729511f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182116,"FileName":"d86c3fb5-d519-41a1-b31f-a75e2e13ce41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182116,"FileName":"a1871d01-b405-4e14-ad0e-881617346b01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":182451,"Name":"Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim","ReleaseYear":"2000","Overview":"Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is a real-time strategy game which, unlike other games in the genre, does not have the player directly control his units. Instead, all \"heroes\" are recruited from their respective guilds and as of that moment, their will is their own.\n\nThe player, the eponymous \"majesty\", can direct heroes by placing bounties on areas and specific enemies to motivate heroes. Some heroes like rangers are more keen on exploration, while rogues believe in the rule of gold. All heroes level up with combat experience, thereby increasing their statistics. Wizard's towers and certain temples allow the player to cast certain spells independently from spell-casting heroes. Some guilds and temples are mutually exclusive, and can not be present on the map under the player's ownership at the same time due to their respective heroes' rivalries. The only resource in the game is gold, and is gathered through tax collectors who patrol the player's buildings, through heroes' purchases in buildings such as marketplaces and blacksmiths, and by discovering treasure chests on the map.\n\nThe storyline follows the player as the new king of the fantasy kingdom of Ardania in the quest to reunite the once large state and reclaim it from monsters and evildoers. Missions range from the typical seek-and-destroy type to rescuing certain characters, and there is a random map generator available in single- and multiplayer in which tasks, map types and monster strength can be set at will. The main singleplayer campaign is split to regions, and the final mission of each region requires all prior relevant missions to be completed first. The final mission can only be accessed by finishing the entire rest of the campaign.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cyberlore Studios, Inc.","Publisher":"MacPlay","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":182451,"FileName":"0dfeee10-396c-4b66-acf3-697832cf8438.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":182451,"FileName":"c9084255-2246-4b3c-9985-d60666c201da.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182451,"FileName":"e9a0825c-145c-4cc4-b7e5-68137c62ccfe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":182451,"FileName":"66c5c44a-0ecd-4229-a4ad-a3a28771b6d2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201708,"Name":"Make Millions","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Here's your chance to build a business empire.

The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.\n\nGates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179743,"FileName":"dd9c3ee0-2c8b-4d3a-a5bb-772d78a4c8ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179743,"FileName":"06b4dfcd-8984-4918-bebf-243bfc269697.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179743,"FileName":"157006ab-b06c-42ae-9a8b-ebf260ea92ff.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179743,"FileName":"44ea20de-b552-4908-8bf3-4af4f329e24d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179743,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic II","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":179744,"Name":"Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON.

It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.\n\nIsles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.\n\nThis installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party.

Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.\n\nThe Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the game environment consists of maze-like passages made with pseudo-3D graphics.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player creates a party of six adventurers. There are six classes to choose from: knight, robber, sorcerer, cleric, paladin, and archer. Each character has six main attributes: might, endurance, accuracy, personality, intelligence, and luck, with each class requires proficiency in a specific attribute for effective functioning. There are also five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\n\nAs in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The party starts in a particularly weak state, equipped with only clubs and having no money. The player is free to explore most of the game's locations in any order, and there are few hints as to what needs to be done to advance the plot. Turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies typically take place against a group of monsters more or less equal in size to the player-controlled party, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain. It is also possible to try and bribe enemies or surrender to them before entering combat.\n\nThe game has no auto-mapping feature of any kind and it is only possible to save the player's progress at inns located in towns.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179741,"FileName":"b079a7e3-c5d6-488c-aca3-b062aef91117.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179741,"FileName":"91587d9c-50cf-435e-8661-b49b9b39d808.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179741,"FileName":"4dd29605-e1a4-421d-98fd-bac68fae0a20.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179741,"FileName":"edfbe681-803a-4eca-9f12-a2645739df26.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179741,"FileName":"c15f4645-f07e-4036-88c1-c0183d7887cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179741,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic: Book One","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179741,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":183832,"Name":"Might and Magic: World of Xeen","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"World of Xeen combines two games - Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen - into a single game that can be played continuously.

The game features hand-painted graphics, and is the first to utilize LucasArts' iMUSE system, which synchronizes music with visual action on the screen by providing smooth transition between themes.\n\nThe events of the game take place on a new set of islands; a part of the game allows the player to explore several islands simultaneously.

The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale. Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title.

The player takes control of Native Nick and gets to move around the island with either keyboard or mouse controls. To get help in retrieving the nose, the player has to talk with the idols and ask what they want in return for their help. This can be either gifts or magic spells. Most of the game involves searching for and collecting these items. Sometimes a magic spell is needed to retrieve the items. The mutants are not all very friendly and might be dangerous or require magic to overcome. The player also has to watch out for the mutated islanders who tries to steal items from the player's inventory. When they attack the player can protect himself by bonking them and they will then be stunned for a short while.\n\nThe game has a time limit. The player has to complete it in 30, 60 or 90 minutes depending on his choice.

When an encounter with an angry ghost startles Nancy and scares other guests away, she begins investigating a mysterious death which occurred at the inn five years ago.\n\nNancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge has a colorful 3D atmosphere and characters. Some parts of the game are intended to give players a sense of foreboding and, therefore, have haunting music and darker scenes.\n\nConversations with the in-game characters trigger other events, puzzle-solving opportunities and additional character questions. Puzzles are varied and numerous. Some are based on cultural pastimes like sudoku and pachinko. Others include number puzzles, or image manipulating puzzles. Like in Message in a Haunted Mansion, the game includes a clock since the time of day influences when some events or conversations will occur. Players will also take part in crafting (origami and calligraphy) and cooking a Japanese meal. \n\nThe game plays similarly to other releases in the series with a point-and-click interface. Icons are placed at the bottom of the screen for inventory, a journal, a cellphone which doubles as a camera, a to-do checklist and other game mechanics. There is a bonus system that awards achievements to those who are the most thorough detectives. Previously given to Preorder customers as a \"digital special edition\", these achievements come in the form of additional material like mini-games for Nancy's cellphone or outfits for her phone avatar.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"Her Interactive","Publisher":"Her Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"b4f51e36-c1cb-4026-9508-e86fabe81c05.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"68b1eb7d-a25e-46e7-8eab-6e5cc1692cb9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"045ab758-a63c-4a30-bf2d-124653bac3de.jpg","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"9c5609a2-6318-4489-9571-162a51e970b2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"4c377aab-3fcc-4bc9-9469-3f1b7cbfde18.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"4cbb26ab-43e5-4142-8712-ba6fdce063ee.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"3a593cec-11ef-452b-befd-c7f2d020c633.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"1295207b-9e70-4168-8588-fb643198c030.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":160703,"FileName":"72b0db0f-ef6b-4b9a-8cbb-427e506b7e8d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":160718,"Name":"Nancy Drew: The Captive Curse","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"According to local legend, a mysterious creature emerged from the forest near Castle Finster long ago, snatched a girl wearing a jeweled necklace, and then disappeared.

Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.\n\nOut of This World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.\n\nTypically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen).

A key feature of the game is the characters' banter between each other.

The remaining cards are used by everyone to make their hand, but you don't know what they are.

Just because you have a poor hand doesn't mean that you will automatically lose - you can trick your opponents into thinking that you've got something much better, causing them to fold first.\n\nAs you win games, you'll unlock new themed card decks and poker tables, which can be selected from the in-game options. Occasionally, one character will put their special item up as a buy in rather than their standard wad o' cash.

The city is thriving, and looks quite idyllic; but a sinister force is lurking deep in the shadows... After the heroes leave to escort the council member Sasha on a diplomatic assignment, the evil Lord Bane sends four of his most feared lieutenants to destroy the cities of Faerun and twist our dimension. The goal is clear: explore the land and rid it of the evil, by taking on Bane's minions one by one...\n\nPools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan.

It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\n\nThe game retains Portal '​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\n\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZD17pQSqUU","Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle; Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6271,"FileName":"48f91c67-f206-4786-b7d4-f42b4327e156.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6271,"FileName":"0ceda75c-6ad2-49f5-b9f0-51c0a9b2dc61.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6271,"FileName":"6f473a1f-a9c9-45b0-8579-1f3a37491ace.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6271,"FileName":"57c57097-fb88-43f7-8275-2021d06af90a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6271,"FileName":"dcd0d41b-fd3d-472f-a566-f11a9fb6ced6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20757,"Name":"Power Pete","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"At the Toy Mart, the lights go out and bone-hurling cavemen, evil clowns, and crazed robots are among the bad toys who are out to attack and take over.

But after an sandstorm he falls down into a canyon and meets Elika, a princess with magical powers. She's being hunted by the army of her father and has to make her way to the temple beneath the tree of life.\n\nBut they come too late. After a brief fight against her father, he breaks the seal and by doing so unlocks the prison chamber that was kept closed by the powers of the Tree of Life. The inhabitant of that prison? Ahriman - God of Darkness. Creator of the darkness of space and the first to unleash envy and hate. Back in the days he was not satisfied with keeping only one half of the universe and after a fierce battle against his brother Ormazd, God of Light, he almost won. In a last attempt Ormazd successfully lured Ahriman into the Tree of Life, condemning him to a thousand years of pain. But Ahriman was only waiting. Waiting and planning and now that he is free, he and his minions are beginning to claim back what they lost and the only two people on the world to stop them are the Prince and Elika.\n\nThe basic gameplay remains the same as in the previous trilogy with the Prince engaging in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more, in his quest to save the world. But opposed to the previous trilogy, the Prince neither can rewind time nor has to fight multiple enemies at a time. Instead he and Elika only face one, strong enemy every time and if the Prince is about to die because of a miscalculated jump or anyhing similar, she uses her powers and sets the Prince back to the beginning of the jumping puzzle. That is not the only thing she does. By command of the player, she also helps in fights, allows him to jump further distances by giving him a little push in the back in mid-air and shows which way to go next. Elika is also the key to bring the Tree of Life back to full strength. But to do so, she needs so-called \"Seeds of Life\" that are scattered all around the levels. If the player has collected enough of these, Elika will also become stronger.\n\nBesides the enemies being stronger, more intelligent and having more special abilities, the fights play similar to the previous iterations of the series with the Prince slashing away at enemies with his sword or his gauntlet in to produce powerful combos. The gauntlet also allows the prince to slide down from solid rocks safely to the area below. The game features Quick Time Events when an enemy got a hold on the Prince and uses a cel-shaded and heavily stylized look for the characters.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2009-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16203,"FileName":"c2443595-5b2f-4883-bbf5-f222e13ddcfc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199445,"Name":"Prince of Persia (Brøderbund Software)","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état.

Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\nPrince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platformer genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/xjRZvnGR02o","Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform; Racing","Developer":"Presage Software","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"5713c951-8fa1-47ff-a123-c51369e453c0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"c46acaab-85b9-4d55-b665-9e81f57aa7d0.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"2bb3db69-c667-4285-9e1a-2f44bd8469af.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"04aed9a6-93ba-490f-9634-ee1e24118fe2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"abc6bc2b-6f70-44bf-a9a3-3bfd138fb4e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"46d86f77-2f13-4229-af94-2b34dcbe0365.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"aa9fe677-0bd2-4c76-a9dc-41eaef634ee6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"d00bd2fd-177b-4217-85f7-63e68b151d36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"6ae49933-0ae8-425a-840c-02b79e6cb0ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":199445,"FileName":"3516f085-0576-452e-a46f-494b312d8331.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":199445,"AlternateName":"Prince of Persia (1992)","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":179756,"Name":"Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"After having defeated the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar, the brave Prince claimed just one reward: the hand of the beautiful daughter of the Persian Sultan.

It turns out that Jaffar is alive and back for vengeance. Banished from the palace, the unfortunately Prince must travel to faraway lands and find a way to defeat the villain.\n\nPrince of Persia 2 is, like its predecessor, a cinematic platformer. Much of the gameplay is reminiscent of the first game, focusing on precise jumping puzzles, swordfighting, and overcoming many hazards in order to stay alive. Swordfighting is more prominent and features situations where several enemies attack the Prince at once. Reinforcements may arrive after the Prince has eliminated all visible enemies.

This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sonic Team","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2004-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":201977,"FileName":"69b3849b-6f5a-4bcd-92bb-9ca8c7f3fc3b.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201977,"FileName":"a877e94c-a481-4c4d-85a9-34da073a9cd9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201977,"FileName":"4edd7474-d204-4318-9fb4-725bf5d9eb7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201977,"FileName":"bed2caa9-022a-4483-9099-154ebccca1c3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201977,"FileName":"d2bb8e61-a74b-4544-917c-7fd994e4d96b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":201977,"AlternateName":"PuyoPuyo Fever for Macintosh","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":16245,"Name":"Puzzle Agent","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this point-and-click adventure, you play Nelson Tethers, an agent in the puzzle division of the FBI who has been sent to a small town in Minnesota, called Scoggins, to investigate the reason of why the eraser factory of the town (the one that is the sole supplier of the White House) has been shut down, since all others agents sent to the mission failed complaining about difficulty of puzzles they found when investigating the matter.\n\nIn Puzzle Agent, all advancement in the plot is done by solving series of puzzles that appear in the story (and the game also offer some entirely optional ones), which are accompanied by a hint system, accessible by chewing pieces of used bubble gum (with the maximum number of three hints per puzzle), matching the non-sense stylized atmosphere of the story composed by cartoonish artwork.

It is set in Syria in the 12th century where a frail, invisible creature is summoned from a different existence by a sorcerer for an infiltration and assassination mission. He needs to assassinate three targets to recover their weapons. When three types of poison are collected, the being will be free to act on its own, away from the sorcerer's influence. The game is played from a top-down perspective with a slight fisheye lens effect.\n\nThe character is invisible to the human eye, but can still be spotted through sound and visual elements such as blood that sticks to its form or water rippling when it travels through a pool. Water can also be used to wash off the blood and regain full invisibility, which is defined through a percentage. The guards' awareness is shown through a question or exclamation mark above their head, and they will chase the creature as long as it is shown. A single hit is lethal. Movement can be done running or at a much slower pace to remain undetected. Killing is done with a slash, but poison can also be used with a limited amount of it available. By pausing a level map can be accessed to view the environment and important marks such as the target.\n\nPuzzle elements are for instance introduced through keys that need to be taken from specific guards to open doors. There are also many avoidance puzzles through traps. Some puzzles are much more complex and are played out in a separate screen where items and gears need to be manipulated with clues through visuals and sound. Many rooms in the game are secret and optional, and the story is often furthered by overhearing conversations and the creature's own thoughts.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":11149,"FileName":"65fb2779-5ea8-4afe-ae94-44e717791567.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201763,"Name":"Quarterstaff","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"You are Titus.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use. Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories. The main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics. The game features a day/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184528,"FileName":"eef858d5-fc0b-4398-89dc-0d867e8db04c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":184528,"FileName":"c73b2e09-331f-41a7-b1be-b94a37d47a18.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184528,"FileName":"05439b12-bb12-4d08-8a6d-f643edd9798e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184528,"FileName":"6406d952-1571-4f28-8c4a-736ad7ef7d64.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201764,"Name":"Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"The final game in the Quest for Glory series.

The campaign tells the stories of the American officer Joe Sheridan and the German Erich von Richter, which have to command troops in different war zones all over Europe and North America. In accordance with the game's theme the overarching plot is about catching a spy.\n\nIn contrast to most other WWII games, the battles in RUSE: The Art of Deception take place on big maps - and this is to be taken literally. There is no 3D environment, and the only models are the war units on a land map. At least if the player currently is on one of the nearer zoom levels. If the game is zoomed out the player has a greater overview, and the units are shown in an abstract form which can be described as stacked, differently colored poker chips. Then only a whole troop can be given orders; to move single units the player has to use the stepless zoom to have a closer look. The strategy itself consists of the usual system of different unit types which have advantages and disadvantages against other types. Basic base building elements exist, but play no big role: there are only production facilities and defense towers to build. Resource depots can be conquered.\n\nThe combatants can utilize various deceptions. Those are similar to special attacks in other games and apply to a certain part of the map. Examples are hiding all friendly units, showing the movement path of enemy units with big red arrows, fake units to distract the enemy or disguising heavy units as light units (and the other way around).\n\nAdditionally to the campaign there are two co-op maps and four separate maps against powerful AI generals.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16263,"FileName":"9c04924c-9f9d-4d9e-ad4b-a34178652f8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":16263,"AlternateName":"R.U.S.E.: The Art of Deception","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":201765,"Name":"Racter","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Short for \"Raconteur.\" A conversation simulator with a loopy personality.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"Inrac Corporation","Publisher":"Mindscape","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201765,"FileName":"a2cd6277-3fa0-49c8-b519-15ad618d519a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201765,"FileName":"99d36528-f965-4821-ab49-1de3b602c07c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179679,"Name":"Railroad Tycoon II","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":"Establish yourself as a mogul to be reckoned with as you work your way up the ranks of the railway industry in this strategy game.

Rex is soon captured by the planet's cruel elite forces, and must find a way to escape while preserving his virility.\n\nRex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender is a puzzle-solving adventure game with light erotic and comedy elements, somewhat influenced by Leisure Suit Larry and Space Quest series. The interface resembles the one used in most LucasArts games of the time period: the player chooses verbs from a menu at the bottom on the screen, interacting with objects on screen. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based. Three difficulty levels are available.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"MPS Labs","Publisher":"MicroProse Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201772,"FileName":"8e67d5dd-29ea-49f4-8bfb-2b401e04da5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201772,"FileName":"763fa66c-1686-4df2-9442-02dfeae8057e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201772,"FileName":"809beca1-5b0e-4047-9bf6-6ac34776c0f5.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201772,"FileName":"8f13dca5-81cf-4451-a79e-9c8f494f4af3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201772,"FileName":"988e3f9f-115e-4b7c-85c3-df5dacde6fa9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201772,"FileName":"0aece537-b0ad-485f-bfbc-99d6e807b983.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184529,"Name":"Ring: The Legend of the Nibelungen","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"Ring is an interactive science fiction opera adventure, a 3D graphical adventure set in the 40th century that follows the story of Richard Wagner's epic opera Ring of the Nibelungen.

After the events of the first game Shank travels to a country with a South American setting in search of Linda, the woman who raised him at the orphanage. The country is ruled by Magnus, who was elected after promising to deal with the illegal cartels. He has a weak heart however and Linda appears to be the only one who can provide him with a viable transplant, so he kidnaps her. The events start when Shank's bus is halted and due to his fights against Magnus's minions the locals think he joins their rebellion.\n\nCombat is based around chaining attacks together, using revolvers, knives, a shotgun, a chainsaw, a baseball bat, grenades, mines, and more. Offensive attacks combine melee combat with long-ranged attacks, and always with a cartoon-like, over-the-top sense of violence and gore. The block ability from the first game has been replaced by a roll maneuve tot dodge incoming attacks. Entirely new is a counter action. When enemies attack a red exclamation mark appears above their heads. When timed correctly it is possible to grapple them, prevent the attack, and counter with an instant kill. The type of counter attack is different for each type of equipped weapon. Shooting has been made more fluent and it is now possible to switch weapons mid-air or more quickly in the middle of a combo. Weapons can no longer be traded in during levels. It is defined at the start of the game (with a number of weapons that need to be unlocked) and the gear load-out can now be changed after death. Sometimes it is possible to use or activate items in the environment to take out many opponents at once. There are also items such as turrets, decoys, and even a wild boar that can be introduced to hinder the enemy.\n\nNext to the main Campaign story mode with two difficulty levels there is a Survival mode with the goal to survive as long as possible fighting waves of enemies on one of three levels. Survival can be played in offline and online multiplayer for two players, replacing the local cooperative campaign multiplayer mode from the first game. The multiplayer mode introduces 16 different characters each with their own abilities, health bonuses, items discounts and damage modifiers. The characters can also be unlocked for the Campaign mode. During the game different types of rebel intelligence can be collected and these can be viewed in a separate gallery.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2013-02-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16507,"FileName":"5a516652-beab-4eb9-b725-ed82d649184c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16507,"FileName":"2547c9bc-4c62-4255-ac47-810496841954.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16514,"Name":"Shatter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shatter is a modern take on the video game classic Breakout.

The player is able to influence the ball's direction by either pushing it away from the bat or pulling it in. Some of the stones manipulate gravity and change the ball's flight path. And yet other stones explode on impact or fly away in a certain direction. There are also rotated or oddly-shaped playfields, with general Sci-Fi theme.\n\nCertain stones hold power-ups such as a manoeuvrable ball, extra lives, a stronger ball that dives through most stones without bouncing back, and more. Broken stones also release blue fragments that can be collected. These are added to a meter and when it is full, a shard storm can be unleashed. As influencing the ball's trajectory can also attack loose stones, the bat has an optional shield to protect itself.\n\nThe game has different modes and not all of them are available right away. There is a story mode that follows the bat through 10 worlds. It progressively introduces new gameplay elements to the player. Each world has a boss to defeat, all of which can be fought later in the unlockable boss mode. Another mode consists of bonus rounds, where the player has to knock back balls to gain a high score. These are also played after defeating a boss mode in the story mode.

You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.\n\nThe game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American Revolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your colonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.\n\nEach of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony.

Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU).

There are around twenty colonists which will populate your base in one mission or another. Each colonist has personal likes and dislikes, some are social, others will pick fights; you have to achieve a balance. There are a number of game modes, Career Mode, Galaxy Mode, Sandbox Mode, and you can play user-created maps. In individual missions, you will have to compete against rival corporations or aliens for domination of the planet you are exploiting.

While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.\n\nSpace Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.\n\nInterstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first.\n\nIt is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others.\n\nWhen docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179686,"FileName":"9ae20ff4-fc31-475f-a966-a234e0c404e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179686,"FileName":"5f9f94ca-3369-4c0d-a323-09a5c8fd08aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179686,"FileName":"d34ad235-17af-4b32-9a00-4825ae68fa27.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179686,"FileName":"81a759a9-f1ee-43d2-9515-94939204dcbb.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179686,"FileName":"fdede466-0ebe-44be-b70c-3960507be74c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179686,"FileName":"74f5520e-a71e-4ea1-b42a-35f796ccb552.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202818,"Name":"Spaceship Warlock","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Spaceship Warlock is an adventure game created by Mike Saenz and Joe Sparks.

The game takes place 30 years after the events in the movie Star Trek: Nemesis (2002) and builds upon the destruction of the Romulan homeworld Romulus portrayed at the beginning of Star Trek (2009). With the Romulans being crippled and even at the point of extinction, the Klingons seize the opportunity in 2382 and start conquering the Romulan sector, leading to a strained relationship with the Federation. In 2399 the band snaps and the Khitomer Accords, the sole reason for 106 years of peace, are broken. Now the current game date is 2409 and war rages in the Alpha Quadrant with the Federation fighting against the Klingons, an again-strong Dominion, the Borg and several other enemies.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player creates a Federation character and can choose from nine different races including Trill, Andorian and Vulcan. The ability to create a member of the Klingon Empire like a Gorn or an Orion becomes only available after reaching level 6 (of 50) as a member of the Federation. This limitation takes into consideration that the Klingon Empire is focused on Player-vs-Player-Combat either against themselves or members of the Federation in combat-arenas or in space with only a handful of quests being available to Klingon players. Besides that difference, the gameplay remains the same on both sides.\n\nThe game is divided into two parts: Space and Land. Right from the start of the game, the player has full control over his own star-ship from a 3rd-person point-of-view allowing him to traverse the space between the sectors and the star-systems on a tactical map as well as take part in full-blown space battles. The player always directly controls the movement of his ship and has full control over its speed, weapons, shields and energy-allocation making the battles very tactical, although not as complex as in the Star Trek: Starfleet Command series. In addition the player has access to special abilities depending on which of the three classes (science, engineering or tactical officer) the player chose for his character. He can also employ help from up to three bridge officers who themselves have special talents.\n\nNPC bridge officers also beam down with the player to planets, stations and such if he's not in a team with other human players. Land battles are fought in real-time (again from a 3rd-person perspective) but are more stationary and play more like combat in other MMOs than the space battles. Although flanking an opponent gives a bonus to damage, using abilities is the main way to success and experience points. Each enemy whether killed in space or on the ground grants experience points and advances both the player and his bridge officers in rank (which function as levels). This way the player and his officers earn skill points to be distributed among the several different skill trees, unlocking new abilities for both ground and space or improving existing ones. \n\nThe player always has full control over his bridge officers. He alone decides their armor and weaponry, which skills they level up and if they are worthy to be promoted to a new rank. This is also the case for his ship which he can outfit with better gear, change the appearance of or replace with a completely new one once he's reached specific ranks and unlocked access to new ship classes.\n\nEach star system in the game is its own instance while the overall tactical map is hosted on one server. Once a player enters a system, he'll automatically join other players already there and be brought up to speed regarding the current status of their quest (if there is one). Once the objectives - usually a combination of space and ground battles - are completed, the players return to the tactical map and can get their reward right away through the use of the communicator instead of flying back to the quest-giver. Typically new quests are also obtained this way.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EOcxMaI7o","Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" MMO","Developer":"Cryptic Studios","Publisher":"Cryptic Studios","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"aad0fcd7-56e1-4b6f-af45-5533b812b2ac.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"c4ab4544-ad71-406f-bcf0-9898fb457dd9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"4ab138a3-d874-4b5f-ba53-f0e9c89bf4dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"7d7964c8-fee8-4ac4-a038-697c35b6db76.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"f2fb29f0-8b25-41b3-8678-7f6dbe28c86b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"2cc71e04-5328-4ec8-9298-c7f575ea592d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"2e9e5278-1582-45ea-91e3-d5f50884ee0f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"d2528815-0553-4595-8967-8e11b5a89486.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22579,"FileName":"e783b334-0cec-43dd-89a0-c40bdb1a9ccf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201878,"Name":"Star Trek: 25th Anniversary: Enhanced CD-ROM","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Piloting the U.S.S.

It has sunk below the surface and is now a subterranean archipelago surrounded by a large ocean, known as the Unterzee. The game is set in the same Victorian steampunk environment of Fallen London and borrows a lot of lore, but now as a game of strategic exploration instead of a pure RPG. At the start a past for the protagonist can be constructed, but it can also be determined at a later time. The captain can be a poet, a street urchin, a war veteran, an ordained priest or a philosopher. It determines a specific crew member, the starting amount of Echo (the main currency) and an extensive bonus for one of the main skills: veils (evasion), pages (knowledge), iron (damage), hearts (healing and morale) and mirrors (deception and perception). In addition a light-class steamer is provided as a first boat along with zailors (crew members), a mascot and a starting level for all skills. Crew member roles include a cook, a gunnery officer, a surgeon, a chief engineer, a first officer etc.\n\nThe next step is choosing an ambition, which determines the winning condition for the game. You can choose to become a venerated explorer (fullfillment), acquire a mansion and retire (wealth), discover your father's bones and bury them (your father's bones), establish a settlement where you rule (a private kingdom), or travel beyond the map's edge (the uttermost East). The rest of the story, past and development is based on the choices made during the game.\n\nStarting in Fallen London the goal is to explore with the ship and survive. Important parameters to track include the engine temperature, the amount of fuel (and tanks) left, hunger (and supplies), terror (zailors' morale), hull status and hold capacity. A Zee Bat can be sent out to search islands and report back. While exploring the lights can be turned off, which raises the terror meter, but reduces the chance of attracting monsters. Repairs can be done at ports, but also en route at the cost of supplies. Most of the information, actions and the many story fragments are grouped together in the Gazetteer. It offers an overview of the ship's contents in the hold (goods and curiosities), a journal and a detailed overview of the officers. When docked it offers access to the story elements, various shops and the shipyard. In main locations the cities and surroundings can be explored, new recruits can be hired, upgrades can be acquired and trade is possible. All of this is shown through text and images in the Gazetteer.\n\nWhile exploring the ship's speed can be determined and it is controlled through keyboard keys. Various ships and creatures are encountered that can be avoided or be battled. Through exploration experience is gained and entries in the logbook are triggered. Many locations can be discovered. Actions and challenges become available that further the story and these are all presented through text and options in the Gazetteer. Some of these only expand the story, while others provide new opportunities and rewards. Other ships can also be docked for similar events.\n\nDuring fights (which can also be avoided) a versus screen is shown with statistics such as health and crew (for ships) for both sides. There are different attack options, but these are only available if the opposition is illuminated sufficiently. The distance between the two parties also plays a role. Combat is turn-based. Selected actions are queued up and then both sides perform them in succession, simultaneously, as each type of action consumes an amount of time. Actions include attack, various types of illumination such as flares, setting the water on fire by spending oil or narrowing the distance, using various forms of evasion, and miscellaneous ones such as quick repairs or observation to study the enemy. Each action has advantages and drawbacks and many influence illumination of your ship and the enemy, which is one of the most important parameters during combat. It also possible to disengage and escape from the fight. The results of actions are shown through a log on the right with some visual effects. Loot, food and knowledge can be gathered for additional items or trade.\n\nTo survive the player carefully needs to manage the various resources and exploration options. The map is randomly generated for each session with only a few major shorelines in fixed positions. In the same way the story is not fixed and is it based on different fragments that are weaved together in different ways. It is possible to leave behind a legacy and pass on information, weapons, money, crew members, the chart or skills for the next adventurer. It is also possible to ignore the initial ambition and explore other opportunities and secrets instead.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":25628,"FileName":"bc5d09db-0917-4dda-b934-2db5bfaafae8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184538,"Name":"Super Hang-On","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"In Super Hang-On you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit.

Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest.\n\nSix character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer.

The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings. \n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Evryware","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"818fa4cb-654d-438b-bc31-68fc4fc80500.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"89638512-d1fb-45fa-8597-35a10b1e2e03.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"e997b164-24fd-4ef4-8826-eddb8bfaecc1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"a4299746-05a0-4ccc-b8a9-ef23be69aa85.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"e0fba6c0-edb9-4c95-b59b-bded60cf4a35.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"6be75891-d798-4d51-ad94-9ac0bdfc65bb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":30746,"FileName":"0496df90-533c-4b79-bf24-776be8e7e40c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164582,"Name":"The Ancient Art of War at Sea","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The Ancient Art of War at Sea is the sequel to the Ancient Art of War.

It tries to evoke a feeling and tell an elaborate story with a small segment of gameplay. The player controls an elderly woman, shown from a third-person perspective. She visits a graveyard. The exploration is limited as she can only move towards a bench in front of a church. Struck by her age, she moves about slowly and needs a cane to keep her balance. She can sit down on the bench and then exit the graveyard again.\n\nAlthough the game elements seem limited - the camera restricts the player from entering any of the side paths - the woman's story is told through a song that starts playing when she sits down. The lyrics are in Dutch, but they are transcribed in English at the bottom of the screen. The full version of the game introduces a random time of death for the woman, not allowing the player to exit the graveyard and enhancing the drama. The game is entirely in black and white, but there are various lighting effects and birds flying around.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Tale of Tales","Publisher":"Tale of Tales","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10374,"FileName":"a831571b-8dec-4f58-8c0d-0d7a181c3d26.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201830,"Name":"The Guild of Thieves","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The Guild of Thieves is an interactive fiction game by Magnetic Scrolls first published by Rainbird in 1987.

The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.\n\nThe puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous \"insult swordfighting\", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179682,"FileName":"e9d2b368-5111-4a95-a527-b3c5503e28ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179682,"FileName":"f0bbf94d-7dfd-4359-afda-960c52adafeb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179682,"FileName":"0668428c-f19b-4def-84be-e7cbed2a8b5f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179682,"FileName":"b611fbf2-a821-4f22-a9fd-d52f79c1fc46.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179682,"FileName":"6b0b890f-482e-4064-b44b-f38a9f91f9b6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201840,"Name":"The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"Veni, Vidi, Vici is the sequel of the well-known Settlers game.

The board is viewed with a depth-perspective so that pieces and squares appear smaller the further away they are.\n\nAt first, 6 chess pieces are lined up at front of the board and you choose which piece you want Alice to take on the moves of. Once the game starts, Alice (seen from a behind-view) must capture all pieces on the board. All pieces will hop around in arcing moves above the board and you as Alice must click on squares that are valid to move to according to the abilities of the piece you chose at start. If you are captured, your score decreases, and increases based on the value of pieces taken. A perfect score of 999 is only possible if you allow all the pawns to become queens before capturing them.\n\nThere is an options screen if you hold your mouse pointer over the score. The Cheshire Cat appears on-screen and you can alter the game speed, flip the board upside-down or activate holes to appear randomly on chess board which capture any piece unlucky to be on that square.\n\nThe game disk also contained some extras such as fonts and a maze generator game called Amazing.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Board Game","Developer":"Apple Computer","Publisher":"Apple Computer","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":200937,"FileName":"3a4f4911-1360-40c2-bc97-3c9cc4634d97.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":200937,"FileName":"6e823461-d0d9-4bc7-ab30-39305453c044.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":200937,"FileName":"193885ea-db73-4aa6-bf93-a45e75a8b2c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201845,"Name":"Time and Magik","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"In a similar manner to Jewels of Darkness, this collection brings together three interlinked Level 9 adventures:\n\nLords of Time\nRed Moon\nThe Price of Magik\n\nThe games have all been updated into the company's later adventure system, and have longer textual descriptions and some slight puzzle tweaks.

The Kira colony was founded as political experiment for cooperation between seven divided alien races. After Lamina was destroyed by a nuclear war, the colony was on its own, and a certain Siboot founded a new civilization, based on a universal telepathic language called \"Eeyal\" and led by a Shepherd. Now the fourth and last Shepherd has died, and there is a fierce competition between the seven acolytes, including you, for his title.\n\nTo become Shepherd, you have to collect eight \"auras\" in three different areas -- tanaga (fear), katsin (trust) and shial (love). At night, the acolytes fight mental duels in a rock-paper-scissors kind, where success depends on knowing the aura ratings of the duelist -- which is why collecting as much information about the others' aura is crucial..\n\nEach morning you awake with the knowledge of one aura rating for each acolyte, and during the day, you try to collect as much information as possible by interacting with your competitors. All this is done an iconic representation of Eeyal, which allows for many ways of interaction like telling, asking, threatening, begging, accusing, promising, yelling, deriding, saying thanks or sorry or just expressing emotion or holding smalltalk. There also is some way of trading information by constructing sentences like \"if you tell me the tanaga count of X, I tell you the shial count of Y\" -- all this done by clicking small icons.\n\nEach competitor has its own personality, and they fear, trust and love each person differently. Everything you do will have effects on the way the acolytes react you, so you will have to find a careful balance between getting enough information and not abusing your allies. The same holds true for the all acolytes, the NPCs are constantly running around and talking to each other.\n\nIn between all that interaction, the game is interspersed by cutscenes which present you with a certain situation to which you can react in multiple choice style. It offers a save and restore function as well as three difficulty and three game length settings. The game came delivered with a manual and a novella by Chris Crawford which are very helpful to getting started.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy; Education","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Mindscape, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179693,"FileName":"13b191ab-162e-483a-b569-6e6795b6abaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179693,"FileName":"08392662-a38c-4216-aed8-c8344712579c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":179693,"AlternateName":"Siboot","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":201847,"Name":"Twilight's Ransom","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"An illustrated text adventure in the style of late-era Infocom.\n\nTwilight's Ransom is set in the fictional Liberty City, and casts the player as Ron Mulligan, a graphic artist in love with Maria Chavez, a Salvadoran immigrant working as a waitress and taking classes at the local college.

The scope of the game is bigger, in that there are several more places to explore, even though some of them (like most of the solar system planets and the dungeons and towers) are optional and not required to complete the game.\n\nIn the game, the player has to travel to several different time periods of Earth, using time doors. The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological period), Pangea (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, \"before the dawn of civilization\"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Richard Garriott","Publisher":"Sierra Online, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177304,"FileName":"027765a6-7670-4c20-81c2-cafe71e8222b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177304,"FileName":"c7350aaf-a07a-49ec-befa-83426243199d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177304,"FileName":"ab85e3d1-4be0-47ea-96e7-f01b96179954.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177304,"FileName":"0a7cf431-1a92-412d-a425-b2429133a541.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177304,"FileName":"34265b0e-9118-452b-9ae2-946a2699044b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177304,"FileName":"dad3bf28-a389-44d4-89a9-7ebb9e2cbea6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177302,"Name":"Ultima III: Exodus","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria.

After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179777,"FileName":"d5fbee12-016d-4d38-b4e6-a4758ec4fb76.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":179777,"FileName":"52d1308c-7bb8-43be-a418-49bf9d4e9aa4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179777,"FileName":"ab0054fd-5878-454d-a62e-a9caf923c655.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179777,"FileName":"e4728ce3-07b8-4f74-b9a3-475f2ff5d996.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179777,"FileName":"5a7d9b36-d1ef-43b7-9e0a-a96ee3e6ba54.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179777,"FileName":"36c61a36-a3fa-41ee-bdb5-43409e6a164c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177378,"Name":"Wizard's Fire","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"A fantasy-themed clone of Missile Command released as a shareware title in 1985.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mark Sumner","Publisher":"CSI Design Group","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177378,"FileName":"fc41af3a-0c98-450f-8882-02338c8bb867.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177378,"FileName":"88bc9e75-9eba-4095-a72d-6c382c35cd6c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177378,"FileName":"f20c4de2-1c51-4ad2-9b65-422a3f40b1e5.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177378,"FileName":"9f45cec9-7aa0-49fd-93fa-0b33832f41ae.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179778,"Name":"Wolfenstein 3D","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"This release of Wolfenstein 3D includes 90 levels:\n\nThe 30 levels of the SNES/Jaguar version (called the \"Second Encounter\" on the Macintosh, the \"Original Encounter\" on the 3DO and Apple IIgs).\n\nThe 60 levels of the original PC version (called the \"Third Encounter\" on the Macintosh).\n\nThe two Macintosh \"Encounter\" versions had been previously available on their own via mail order.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"id Software, Inc.","Publisher":"MacPlay","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"676f9ad8-bcd0-4f30-814c-a2852213e807.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"2274781b-3c10-40e1-8d1c-612af9ced028.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"2cdf3ef9-1c5e-48d2-be70-ea03bebfc5ff.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"0c61dac1-9916-4646-9804-dc19cea5697e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"1180e888-3199-4c53-99cf-ee4f111f8bf7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"adfb5ed4-2bf9-46eb-84b5-b04e682e60ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179778,"FileName":"c2dc4bbd-d5af-4886-956c-99e7e790db58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179779,"Name":"Wolfpack","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"In this WW2 combat simulation one or two players can take command of one of three different sets of naval vessels.

Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz.\n\nThe game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.\n\nBattles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow. The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace. If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again. If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations, and immune against some.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"Synergy","Publisher":"Synergy","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-10T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":201872,"FileName":"42fba334-3821-4769-8764-6beebe76c4fc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201872,"FileName":"dd6dc91d-1229-474b-87cb-2f966d8c5fa8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201872,"FileName":"fb26252b-6b5a-4d48-8124-c9946c6cbef1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":201872,"FileName":"3873b6aa-a6b7-48c4-a6f6-7d423506b95a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201872,"FileName":"a9cd48ae-468a-4ad3-a290-0061965318e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201873,"Name":"Yellow Brick Road II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Glinda is being held captive in a magical crystal ball and must be saved!

When a player fulfills a certain condition (such as the number of tenants), a VIP visits the building, and if his impression is favourable, the rating goes up, unlocking more rooms and facilities to expand the tower. The goal is to reach the ultimate level, and place an attraction (such as a chapel or a baseball field) on the top floor.\n\nThere are several rooms to expand your tower, usually starting with stores and restaurants plus hotel rooms (which provide daily income), expanding to offices, condominiums and apartments and other tenancy rooms. However, all these rooms need extra support in the form of facilities such as restrooms, vigilance rooms, as well as convention centers to attract more visitors or simply please your tenants. They must be always happy, or you risk seeing them leave if they aren't happy with the time it takes to move between locations or if there's too much noise.\n\nOne of the key aspects in the game is balancing the transport system - elevators, stairs and escalators. There are thee kinds of elevators: Simple, Express or Service. Simple elevators provide floor-to-floor operation (although you can choose not to stop at a particular floor), Express work in 15 floor intervals and Service are used only by stores and general tower staff (security and cleaning). More than one elevator can be added to a shaft, but each shaft has a limit on the floors it can cover. Stairs and escalators do the same function: short travel between floors, but while escalators are used for commercial areas, stairs are used for residential and office blocks.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"OPeNBooK9003 inc.","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":183842,"FileName":"4730aa87-fc04-407e-a3a2-d0252259b3b8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":183842,"FileName":"04315389-53b3-4415-bb8d-9e979d3922d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":183842,"FileName":"63ff09ef-60ed-43cd-b132-95cd92466052.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":183842,"FileName":"1c2b3977-c675-4846-aea5-fc33f3a15c57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183842,"FileName":"ec6dc9c5-dd17-45dd-a45c-e29e9f47c8ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179637,"Name":"Zero Critical","ReleaseYear":"1998","Overview":"Rheom 1 is a terrestrial planet of eternal daylight.

Like in a dream, you hear a mysterious voice telling you that you have passed all the tests but one. When consciousness returns to you, you find yourself on the endless spiral of stairs, with only your trusty lantern near you... will you be able to survive the horrors of the Dungeon?\n\nLike its predecessors, Zork III: The Dungeon Master is a text adventure game. You read descriptions of rooms and then interact with the game by typing commands. As all early Zork games, it is very easy to get stuck in the game, so you'll have to reload several times in order to find the correct way.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Infocom","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201515,"FileName":"f97ac30e-eddc-4018-a525-bd0bad62fa7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201515,"FileName":"81af31b6-7a85-4105-b227-a78e68b9be8d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":201492,"Name":"Zork Zero: The Revenge of Megaboz","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive was so much in love with himself that he ordered to erect a huge statue of himself in the Fublio Valley. This angered a local resident named Megaboz the Magnificent, who cast a curse over Dimwit and the entire Empire, and disappeared. Ninety-four years later, the curse is still in effect, and the king Wurb Flathead is looking for a brave adventurer who would find a way to remove it. This adventurer, naturally, is the game's protagonist, who possesses a piece of parchment given to him by his ancestors, which might be the key to the whole mystery...\n\nZork Zero: The Revenge of Megaboz is chronologically a prequel to the first three Zork games, and is a text adventure with a graphical interface and scene-based colors and borders. Like its predecessors, the game relies on puzzle-solving, including inventory item manipulation as well as logic-based puzzles. An interactive map, in-game hint system, and the included Encyclopedia Frobozzica are there to make the player's task somewhat easier. The game also includes four graphical mini-games based on popular logic puzzles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Infocom","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":201492,"FileName":"422e4cf4-b6b9-4efd-a684-7afe760e0d00.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201492,"FileName":"54a42867-e738-4075-a748-a271e3134e09.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201492,"FileName":"05db3731-20a3-4ce0-aa36-49ca7b3d1c72.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201492,"FileName":"8abdac3d-5d6a-4304-b9ae-8bdd719d355d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":201492,"FileName":"f38ba53f-f14a-4564-a6c6-dd8804bc8a2e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":201492,"FileName":"655f604f-841a-41ca-8fa3-aee7aa616803.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":171733,"Name":"Zork: Grand Inquisitor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Magic has been banned from the great Underground Empire of Zork. By edict of the Grand Inquisitor Mir Yannick, the Empire has been sealed off and the practice of mystic arts declared punishable by \"Totemization\" (a very bad thing). The only way to restore magic to the kingdom is to find three hidden artifacts: The Coconut of Quendor, The Cube of Foundation, and The Skull of Yoruk. Join forces with Dungeon Master Dalboz who calls you \"AFGNCAAP\"( politically-correct initialism for \"Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person\") and together you travel throughout the Underground Empire's many locations, such as Hades, Flood Control Dam #3 and The Dungeon Master's Lair in an attempt to find the three missing artifacts and bring about the fall of the Inquisition. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is the last installment of the famous Zork adventure series. It uses the same formula as its predecessor: first-person perspective, 360 degree camera rotation, pre-rendered backgrounds, and live actors. Humor and comical pop-culture references accompany you throughout the entire game and guarantee that you will never get bored. So if you are looking for a not so serious oldschool adventure then this gem is for you.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple Mac OS","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2001-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":171733,"FileName":"3e56fa31-5534-46f3-8662-08bfa0f6d304.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":171733,"FileName":"f0f9b968-42be-4191-bf12-d810e5a95d59.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]}]}
