It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\n\nThe game retains Portal '​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\n\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time.","ReleaseDate":"2011-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JZD17pQSqUU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Portal_2"},"8158":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"M - Mature","Images":[{"FileName":"6f7df125-a219-4b51-923c-eca2820d5bb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"37c58611-cc9e-42a5-8752-0398c827566b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Left 4 Dead","Overview":"Left 4 Dead is a cooperative first-person shooter video game with survival horror elements, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and published by Valve Corporation. The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008.\n\nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.\n\nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009.\n\nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions.","ReleaseDate":"2010-10-28T00:00:00-07:00"},"8171":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Montreal","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Stealth","Images":[{"FileName":"1e1955f1-ef0a-44e6-bb8f-5e4e783c3aab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aef95cef-9af6-41de-bd3b-ee922f4a4651.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"591995dd-346c-4943-a5aa-fb54c7256ba9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b30509c3-8c9e-42cc-8f8d-9e6bd1b66a1a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood","Overview":"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a 2010 historical action-adventure open world stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the third major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, a direct sequel to 2009's Assassin's Creed II, and the second chapter in the 'Ezio trilogy'. The game was first released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November and December 2010, and was later made available on Microsoft Windows in March and June 2011.\n\nThe story is set in a fictional history of real world events set in two time periods, the 16th and 21st centuries. The main portion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to prevent the 2012 apocalypse.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Ezio's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Ezio is able to freely explore 16th-century Rome to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game introduced a multiplayer component to the series, portrayed as a Templar training program.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim along with multiple awards including a BAFTA award for Best Action Game. It was followed in November 2011 by Assassin's Creed: Revelations, a direct sequel that served as a conclusion to Ezio's story and continued the story of Desmond Miles.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2011-03-22T00:00:00-07:00"},"9042":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"e4ffa3cb-abd0-4db1-bc45-6eff82f378b4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Total Annihilation","Overview":"Total Annihilation is a real-time strategy video game created by Cavedog Entertainment, a sub-division of Humongous Entertainment, and released on September 30, 1997 by GT Interactive for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.[3] It was the first real-time strategy game to feature 3D units and terrain.

The gameplay is typical for the genre. The player has to stop an enemy invasion and this is done by placing turrets on the battlefield. The enemies come in waves that gets increasingly more difficult and to complete a level the player is not allowed to let more than 15 enemy units through to his base. The attacking forces follow certain paths and the player has to employ turrets in range of the enemy route (which changes between waves). The game features both land, air and sea enemy units. There are a few different turrets to choose from. Machine guns are good for light but fast units while cannons are slow and better suited for armored units. There are also sabotage turrets that slow down the enemies and comms that increases the performance of nearby turrets. For flying enemies anti-aircraft artillery is needed. The player earns money for destroying enemies and these can be used to upgrade and repair turrets. The enemies fire back at the turrets so repairs are necessary or they might be destroyed which is costly. \n\nThe game consists of two campaigns and quickplays. First the player takes control of the allies and once it's been completed the axis campaign is unlocked. The player earns victory points for every completed level and these can be used to unlock weapon upgrades. After every three levels the player gets to play a bonus counterattack level where he gets to revisit a previous level and can then get extra victory points.","ReleaseDate":"2011-05-26T00:00:00-07:00"},"10049":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"PopCap","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"c224cdce-f436-4aea-92bf-32c163e76a05.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"81dda248-5633-431c-b0f8-6b3861b3fca4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3258b6af-c04e-4f87-9e67-34f131f1179d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b520f4f8-1859-41ef-a867-edaa8284f085.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"21400037-96cb-48aa-9b02-bbf98a0b69a4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Bejeweled 3","Overview":"The biggest, brightest Bejeweled ever!

The exploration is limited as she can only move towards a bench in front of a church. Struck by her age, she moves about slowly and needs a cane to keep her balance. She can sit down on the bench and then exit the graveyard again.\n\nAlthough the game elements seem limited - the camera restricts the player from entering any of the side paths - the woman's story is told through a song that starts playing when she sits down. The lyrics are in Dutch, but they are transcribed in English at the bottom of the screen. The full version of the game introduces a random time of death for the woman, not allowing the player to exit the graveyard and enhancing the drama. The game is entirely in black and white, but there are various lighting effects and birds flying around.","Publisher":"Tale of Tales","ReleaseDate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"10376":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Valve","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ee31ffad-436f-4bb4-8f57-98c3242bb079.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a3ac01e-2b91-455f-80e8-872f4db1f9e2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"24253e16-0936-4463-93cd-9debc88c83a8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dac87bf0-36e5-459d-b1b1-b965286e816f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":32,"Name":"Team Fortress 2","Overview":"Team Fortress 2 is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map.This year’s most anticipated online action game, TF2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valve’s next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more.","Publisher":"Valve","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-10T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eQ8duKs2Plw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Team_Fortress_2"},"10520":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Telltale Games","Images":[{"FileName":"3b99eb5d-6161-4289-8835-39a0b501016b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Poker Night at the Inventory","Overview":"Hidden in a back alley lies a secret club, known as The Inventory.

A key feature of the game is the characters' banter between each other. They will chat with other players, bluff, taunt and worry when they think they're in trouble.\n\nPoker Night at the Inventory is, at its core, a simulation of Texas Hold 'em Poker. You play against four opponents (Tycho, The Heavy, Strong Bad and Max) and attempt to beat them in a game of Poker. As the game is played in Hold 'em style, each player is dealt two cards. The remaining cards are used by everyone to make their hand, but you don't know what they are. Based on the cards you have, as well as the cards that get revealed through a round, it's up to you whether to gamble, bluff or fold. Just because you have a poor hand doesn't mean that you will automatically lose - you can trick your opponents into thinking that you've got something much better, causing them to fold first.\n\nAs you win games, you'll unlock new themed card decks and poker tables, which can be selected from the in-game options. Occasionally, one character will put their special item up as a buy in rather than their standard wad o' cash. If you make the character go bust when they've bought in with their special item, you obtain it for yourself and can use it in Team Fortress 2.","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-22T00:00:00-08:00"},"10845":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Housemarque","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"0f007421-e028-444d-a378-430174b3ecc5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Furmins","Overview":"Lead the Furmins through over 100 ingeniously designed and visually stunning levels.

It is set in Syria in the 12th century where a frail, invisible creature is summoned from a different existence by a sorcerer for an infiltration and assassination mission. He needs to assassinate three targets to recover their weapons. When three types of poison are collected, the being will be free to act on its own, away from the sorcerer's influence. The game is played from a top-down perspective with a slight fisheye lens effect.\n\nThe character is invisible to the human eye, but can still be spotted through sound and visual elements such as blood that sticks to its form or water rippling when it travels through a pool. Water can also be used to wash off the blood and regain full invisibility, which is defined through a percentage. The guards' awareness is shown through a question or exclamation mark above their head, and they will chase the creature as long as it is shown. A single hit is lethal. Movement can be done running or at a much slower pace to remain undetected. Killing is done with a slash, but poison can also be used with a limited amount of it available. By pausing a level map can be accessed to view the environment and important marks such as the target.\n\nPuzzle elements are for instance introduced through keys that need to be taken from specific guards to open doors. There are also many avoidance puzzles through traps. Some puzzles are much more complex and are played out in a separate screen where items and gears need to be manipulated with clues through visuals and sound. Many rooms in the game are secret and optional, and the story is often furthered by overhearing conversations and the creature's own thoughts.","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"11958":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blizzard Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Horror; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"c04bfbd6-da74-4127-b14e-0afe3b9b3d67.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"13c17f2f-c8c3-42b9-b050-f4eeac4ba512.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"167b4647-8ed6-4106-9519-6f65f34cc4f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"377a67fb-27dd-4283-87d6-707b0b83642c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"153a6c2e-3941-4066-ac88-7b3af7210310.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Diablo III","Overview":"The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo series.

The player controls Tim during his search for a princess he has known and lost. Although the objective appears to be rather straightforward at first, the meaning and the motives become much more implicit and are interwoven with the mechanics during the course of the game. From a main hub, Tim can eventually access six worlds that consist of different areas. The start of each world reveals a part of the Tim's background and emotions, rather than progressing a storyline. The second to the sixth world can be entirely explored without solving all the puzzles. Difficult situations can be ignored and revisited later. When all worlds have been completed, the first one becomes available and brings closure to the story.\n\nThe game's concept is entirely based around time manipulation. Tim cannot die permanently as the player can rewind time at any moment and usually for any length, even all the way back when an area was entered. While rewinding, the music is synchronized in a similar fashion. Rather than a gimmick, rewinding is an essential element to solve the puzzles. The different worlds give a spin to the mechanic by introducing clones as the player collaborates in a parallel reality with a past version of himself, time can be affected through the movement direction, and Tim can create a circular area to cause time dilation. Certain items, enemies and parts of the scenery are immune to time manipulation or behave in a very different way. Puzzles require close examination of the environment and the behaviour of different items and enemies. As such, the game is entirely about solving the puzzle theoretically by applying the game mechanics and then using trial and error to executive it and discover possible flaws in the proposed logic. This also brings limited replayability to the game.\n\nA world is solved by collecting the puzzle pieces. These need to be arranged and eventually show a picture related to the game's story. There is no filler in the level design, meaning that every platform, item or game element (except for a few enemies) has a specific purpose to solve a puzzle. Fast times can be tracked in a separate speedrun mode.\n\nThe later released Windows and Macintosh versions are identical, but come with a level editor.","ReleaseDate":"2009-05-20T00:00:00-07:00"},"15348":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"5e8d70f1-edec-495b-a7b4-59351e0a79ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Castle Crashers","Overview":"Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up video game independently developed by The Behemoth and published by Microsoft Game Studios.

If there is an even larger creature above those two creatures, the larger creature will swallow them up immediately, resulting in something called a food chain, which gives the player more points. When a smaller creature hits another, larger, creature, the larger one swallows. After two creatures, the larger ones will eventually explode. If you make one creature eat another and give the larger one to an even larger one, the larger one will explode. \n\nBiggs also has a son, Smalls. He must provide for his son by barfing. In cooperative mode, the second player plays as Smalls. The speed of coming creatures increases by stage, and if the creatures reach the bottom, where Biggs and Smalls are staged, it'll be a game-over. In single-player mode, filling up the hunger meter will clear a stage. \n\nIn the first stages, creatures range from normal sizes and types: small, medium, and large. Later on, they start to range from things like bombs, which explode on combo-impact. As stages vary, background environments change as well--from lush forest environments to dark caves. \n\nMultiplayer modes, which include cooperative and competitive, are endless, and adventures and puzzles have an ending.

The player controls a protagonist simply known as the The Boy, who is said to enter the world Limbo in search of his sister. However, the story as a whole can also be seen as a metaphor for the search for companionship and getting around in a new environment. Not a single clue is given at the start, there are no cut-scenes and the game starts right away. In that world filled with hazards and danger, his means are few and he is extremely vulnerable. Only two buttons are used, a feeble jump and one to perform an action, combined with movement. This allows him to explore the world and hang on ledges, slide down slopes, push objects, pull levers, and cling to ropes, but the player has to make most of what is present in the environment to get by, often with physics-based elements.\n\nThe gloomy world has a dusty filter showing the game through misted glass, and no vivid colours are present. It is divided into 24 chapters that seamlessly flow into each other, only from the level selection in the main menu can be derived where a new chapter starts. The world is rendered in 2D but with different layers of depth in the scenery. It moves from a forest to an abandoned city and eventually an industrial zone. The player faces three kinds of challenges. There are obstacles where The Boy simply needs to find a way to progress, there are dangerous creatures that hunt him down and try to kill them, and finally there is a gang of children who band together to ward off the intruder and set up traps for him, with a touch of Lord of the Flies. Encounters with other humans are however brief and rare. These account for most of the horror moments, of the psychological kind, with other unnerving sequences like when the player is forced to use the corpses of other children as a bridge.\n\nMusic and sound effects are minimal and there are no on-screen elements referring to health or other statistics. Every single misstep, often with gruesome consequences, is fatal. In the same vein the boy cannot jump from great heights or jump very far. When dead, the game immediately reloads before the current puzzle. Most of the encounters are centered around puzzles and these are sometimes based on timing or speed when being chased. Other elements serve only for setting the scene, when The Boy gets to ride a boat to cross a lake (he cannot swim and drowns immediately) or finds the corpses of the people who did not make it in Limbo. Most of the game elements are discovered through experimentation, like the effects of a glowing worm that attaches itself to The Boy's head, changing the flow of gravity, or what happens when a giant spider captures him. There is only a single path through the levels and generally there is only a single solution to a problem.","ReleaseDate":"2011-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Limbo_(video_game)"},"15828":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"d4100e2b-1676-4577-a399-b3ec38aa1016.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2202632-4d9f-4d89-947d-06648cff0a59.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f4e7ba47-7ca7-445c-85e8-063ceec26049.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d529976a-79de-4d2c-9d46-e6bfed1a9e1c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Madden NFL 08","Overview":"EA Sports' 2008 edition in the Madden series has some new features along with an updated roster and some new animations.

But after an sandstorm he falls down into a canyon and meets Elika, a princess with magical powers. She's being hunted by the army of her father and has to make her way to the temple beneath the tree of life.\n\nBut they come too late. After a brief fight against her father, he breaks the seal and by doing so unlocks the prison chamber that was kept closed by the powers of the Tree of Life. The inhabitant of that prison? Ahriman - God of Darkness. Creator of the darkness of space and the first to unleash envy and hate. Back in the days he was not satisfied with keeping only one half of the universe and after a fierce battle against his brother Ormazd, God of Light, he almost won. In a last attempt Ormazd successfully lured Ahriman into the Tree of Life, condemning him to a thousand years of pain. But Ahriman was only waiting. Waiting and planning and now that he is free, he and his minions are beginning to claim back what they lost and the only two people on the world to stop them are the Prince and Elika.\n\nThe basic gameplay remains the same as in the previous trilogy with the Prince engaging in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more, in his quest to save the world. But opposed to the previous trilogy, the Prince neither can rewind time nor has to fight multiple enemies at a time. Instead he and Elika only face one, strong enemy every time and if the Prince is about to die because of a miscalculated jump or anyhing similar, she uses her powers and sets the Prince back to the beginning of the jumping puzzle. That is not the only thing she does. By command of the player, she also helps in fights, allows him to jump further distances by giving him a little push in the back in mid-air and shows which way to go next. Elika is also the key to bring the Tree of Life back to full strength. But to do so, she needs so-called \"Seeds of Life\" that are scattered all around the levels. If the player has collected enough of these, Elika will also become stronger.\n\nBesides the enemies being stronger, more intelligent and having more special abilities, the fights play similar to the previous iterations of the series with the Prince slashing away at enemies with his sword or his gauntlet in to produce powerful combos. The gauntlet also allows the prince to slide down from solid rocks safely to the area below. The game features Quick Time Events when an enemy got a hold on the Prince and uses a cel-shaded and heavily stylized look for the characters.","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"16245":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"99de097c-9e75-428e-9058-3f35925c2508.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Puzzle Agent","Overview":"In this point-and-click adventure, you play Nelson Tethers, an agent in the puzzle division of the FBI who has been sent to a small town in Minnesota, called Scoggins, to investigate the reason of why the eraser factory of the town (the one that is the sole supplier of the White House) has been shut down, since all others agents sent to the mission failed complaining about difficulty of puzzles they found when investigating the matter.\n\nIn Puzzle Agent, all advancement in the plot is done by solving series of puzzles that appear in the story (and the game also offer some entirely optional ones), which are accompanied by a hint system, accessible by chewing pieces of used bubble gum (with the maximum number of three hints per puzzle), matching the non-sense stylized atmosphere of the story composed by cartoonish artwork.

The campaign tells the stories of the American officer Joe Sheridan and the German Erich von Richter, which have to command troops in different war zones all over Europe and North America. In accordance with the game's theme the overarching plot is about catching a spy.\n\nIn contrast to most other WWII games, the battles in RUSE: The Art of Deception take place on big maps - and this is to be taken literally. There is no 3D environment, and the only models are the war units on a land map. At least if the player currently is on one of the nearer zoom levels. If the game is zoomed out the player has a greater overview, and the units are shown in an abstract form which can be described as stacked, differently colored poker chips. Then only a whole troop can be given orders; to move single units the player has to use the stepless zoom to have a closer look. The strategy itself consists of the usual system of different unit types which have advantages and disadvantages against other types. Basic base building elements exist, but play no big role: there are only production facilities and defense towers to build. Resource depots can be conquered.\n\nThe combatants can utilize various deceptions. Those are similar to special attacks in other games and apply to a certain part of the map. Examples are hiding all friendly units, showing the movement path of enemy units with big red arrows, fake units to distract the enemy or disguising heavy units as light units (and the other way around).\n\nAdditionally to the campaign there are two co-op maps and four separate maps against powerful AI generals.","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00"},"16349":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"T - Teen","Images":[{"FileName":"83edb54a-8790-4e8a-9460-2132dfd813b4.png","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Rochard","Overview":"Rochard is a side-scrolling science-fiction platformer where the player takes the titular role of John Rochard, an astrominer in search of his missing crew. With his gravity-manipulating G-Lifter device and his wits, he needs to solve tricky puzzles and dispose of space pirates and other enemies that stand in his way. During the course of the game, Rochard makes his way through various asteroids and space stations. The G-Lifter is the sole weapon in the game, and while in the beginning it only acts as a gravity gun, the player can upgrade it to fire at enemies and throw multiple kinds of grenades. The enemies consist of dim-witted humans and the in-built security systems of the facilities, such as turrets, robots and force fields.","ReleaseDate":"2011-12-22T00:00:00-08:00"},"16507":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"M - Mature","Images":[{"FileName":"5a516652-beab-4eb9-b725-ed82d649184c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2547c9bc-4c62-4255-ac47-810496841954.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Shank 2","Overview":"Shank 2 is the sequel to Shank and just like the first game it is a 2D side-scrolling platformer based around fighting multiple enemies at once, combined with jumping and climbing platform elements. After the events of the first game Shank travels to a country with a South American setting in search of Linda, the woman who raised him at the orphanage. The country is ruled by Magnus, who was elected after promising to deal with the illegal cartels. He has a weak heart however and Linda appears to be the only one who can provide him with a viable transplant, so he kidnaps her. The events start when Shank's bus is halted and due to his fights against Magnus's minions the locals think he joins their rebellion.\n\nCombat is based around chaining attacks together, using revolvers, knives, a shotgun, a chainsaw, a baseball bat, grenades, mines, and more. Offensive attacks combine melee combat with long-ranged attacks, and always with a cartoon-like, over-the-top sense of violence and gore. The block ability from the first game has been replaced by a roll maneuve tot dodge incoming attacks. Entirely new is a counter action. When enemies attack a red exclamation mark appears above their heads. When timed correctly it is possible to grapple them, prevent the attack, and counter with an instant kill. The type of counter attack is different for each type of equipped weapon. Shooting has been made more fluent and it is now possible to switch weapons mid-air or more quickly in the middle of a combo. Weapons can no longer be traded in during levels. It is defined at the start of the game (with a number of weapons that need to be unlocked) and the gear load-out can now be changed after death. Sometimes it is possible to use or activate items in the environment to take out many opponents at once. There are also items such as turrets, decoys, and even a wild boar that can be introduced to hinder the enemy.\n\nNext to the main Campaign story mode with two difficulty levels there is a Survival mode with the goal to survive as long as possible fighting waves of enemies on one of three levels. Survival can be played in offline and online multiplayer for two players, replacing the local cooperative campaign multiplayer mode from the first game. The multiplayer mode introduces 16 different characters each with their own abilities, health bonuses, items discounts and damage modifiers. The characters can also be unlocked for the Campaign mode. During the game different types of rebel intelligence can be collected and these can be viewed in a separate gallery.","ReleaseDate":"2013-02-19T00:00:00-08:00"},"16514":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Images":[{"FileName":"beeeeba7-1bbf-4efe-8238-4fc83436c750.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Shatter","Overview":"Shatter is a modern take on the video game classic Breakout. Like in the original game, the player has to bounce a ball off a bat to hit stones which break on impact. Shatter introduces a couple of new twists to the genre. The player is able to influence the ball's direction by either pushing it away from the bat or pulling it in. Some of the stones manipulate gravity and change the ball's flight path. And yet other stones explode on impact or fly away in a certain direction. There are also rotated or oddly-shaped playfields, with general Sci-Fi theme.\n\nCertain stones hold power-ups such as a manoeuvrable ball, extra lives, a stronger ball that dives through most stones without bouncing back, and more. Broken stones also release blue fragments that can be collected. These are added to a meter and when it is full, a shard storm can be unleashed. As influencing the ball's trajectory can also attack loose stones, the bat has an optional shield to protect itself.\n\nThe game has different modes and not all of them are available right away. There is a story mode that follows the bat through 10 worlds. It progressively introduces new gameplay elements to the player. Each world has a boss to defeat, all of which can be fought later in the unlockable boss mode. Another mode consists of bonus rounds, where the player has to knock back balls to gain a high score. These are also played after defeating a boss mode in the story mode. The other game modes are endless, endless co-op, time attack and time attack co-op.","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-18T00:00:00-07:00"},"16550":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Los Sims 3","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maxis","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"ca35fcca-12bf-49d1-802a-536738fb154f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bdf34dc4-22d1-4cda-8935-276a578b61e2.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d8949f36-c859-48f8-ada1-7656e88f4c29.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"The Sims 3","Overview":"The Sims 3 is the third major title in the life simulation video game developed by The Sims Studio (Maxis) and published by Electronic Arts.

If the enemy's hero loses all health or concedes, the match is won. Rare and powerful cards are offered as separate purchases with the in-game gold currency or real money. They can also be earned by competing in the arena. The currency is provided by completing daily quests and winning matches. Unwanted cards can be discarded and are turned into arcane dust, used to craft new cards.\n\nAt launch the game offered four types of battlefields (Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Pandaria and Stranglethorn), each with interactive elements, but with no influence on the gameplay.","Publisher":"Blizzard Entertainment Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hearthstone"},"22579":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Cryptic Studios","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"MMO","Images":[{"FileName":"aad0fcd7-56e1-4b6f-af45-5533b812b2ac.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c4ab4544-ad71-406f-bcf0-9898fb457dd9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4ab138a3-d874-4b5f-ba53-f0e9c89bf4dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7d7964c8-fee8-4ac4-a038-697c35b6db76.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f2fb29f0-8b25-41b3-8678-7f6dbe28c86b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b2ed7864-6b31-4ccd-8dd1-772677e40acc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"909edc12-889d-4402-8482-7443f8d96bd7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2e9e5278-1582-45ea-91e3-d5f50884ee0f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"87db49e5-c2f7-4146-8466-499b0b9b0841.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Star Trek Online","Overview":"Star Trek Online is a MMORPG set in the Star Trek universe. The game takes place 30 years after the events in the movie Star Trek: Nemesis (2002) and builds upon the destruction of the Romulan homeworld Romulus portrayed at the beginning of Star Trek (2009). With the Romulans being crippled and even at the point of extinction, the Klingons seize the opportunity in 2382 and start conquering the Romulan sector, leading to a strained relationship with the Federation. In 2399 the band snaps and the Khitomer Accords, the sole reason for 106 years of peace, are broken. Now the current game date is 2409 and war rages in the Alpha Quadrant with the Federation fighting against the Klingons, an again-strong Dominion, the Borg and several other enemies.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player creates a Federation character and can choose from nine different races including Trill, Andorian and Vulcan. The ability to create a member of the Klingon Empire like a Gorn or an Orion becomes only available after reaching level 6 (of 50) as a member of the Federation. This limitation takes into consideration that the Klingon Empire is focused on Player-vs-Player-Combat either against themselves or members of the Federation in combat-arenas or in space with only a handful of quests being available to Klingon players. Besides that difference, the gameplay remains the same on both sides.\n\nThe game is divided into two parts: Space and Land. Right from the start of the game, the player has full control over his own star-ship from a 3rd-person point-of-view allowing him to traverse the space between the sectors and the star-systems on a tactical map as well as take part in full-blown space battles. The player always directly controls the movement of his ship and has full control over its speed, weapons, shields and energy-allocation making the battles very tactical, although not as complex as in the Star Trek: Starfleet Command series. In addition the player has access to special abilities depending on which of the three classes (science, engineering or tactical officer) the player chose for his character. He can also employ help from up to three bridge officers who themselves have special talents.\n\nNPC bridge officers also beam down with the player to planets, stations and such if he's not in a team with other human players. Land battles are fought in real-time (again from a 3rd-person perspective) but are more stationary and play more like combat in other MMOs than the space battles. Although flanking an opponent gives a bonus to damage, using abilities is the main way to success and experience points. Each enemy whether killed in space or on the ground grants experience points and advances both the player and his bridge officers in rank (which function as levels). This way the player and his officers earn skill points to be distributed among the several different skill trees, unlocking new abilities for both ground and space or improving existing ones. \n\nThe player always has full control over his bridge officers. He alone decides their armor and weaponry, which skills they level up and if they are worthy to be promoted to a new rank. This is also the case for his ship which he can outfit with better gear, change the appearance of or replace with a completely new one once he's reached specific ranks and unlocked access to new ship classes.\n\nEach star system in the game is its own instance while the overall tactical map is hosted on one server. Once a player enters a system, he'll automatically join other players already there and be brought up to speed regarding the current status of their quest (if there is one). Once the objectives - usually a combination of space and ground battles - are completed, the players return to the tactical map and can get their reward right away through the use of the communicator instead of flying back to the quest-giver. Typically new quests are also obtained this way.","Publisher":"Cryptic Studios","ReleaseDate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x6EOcxMaI7o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Trek_Online"},"23876":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arrowhead Game Studios","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"18e0e0bc-968a-4b61-b5ad-7a40ec975ab3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3dfad004-4e37-4fa0-98d5-d71fb86a1340.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d5aa7bef-13d6-4b26-a7eb-577c010dffd7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5c82f1f4-cfc5-41f3-a41f-5af827e13c09.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"56ccf714-c176-47c2-bde5-156f54803fd6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"UFO: Alien Invasion","Overview":"UFO: Alien Invasion is a futuristic, squad-based and turn-based strategy game set in 2084, heavily inspired by X-COM, but not a sequel or a remake.

Unlike many other tower defence games it is set in a fantasy setting and uses heroes as \"towers\" instead of structures. \n\nThe player character is a female librarian named Azra (all character names, as well as appearances can be edited) who was thrown into the titular Valley of the Forgotten, which is referred to as The Pit\" in the game, after contracting a dangerous plague. But not only surviving the fall but also the plague Azra is now trapped in the Pit. Next to other survivors, the Pit is host to a number of dead plague victims, which have turned into invincible (and very Zombie like) revenants. While normally invincible, Azra has the unique ability in drawing other character into the so called \"half world\", where they can hurt those revenants. Unfortunately, while being in this \"half world\", the character cannot move from their positions and only attack in a radius around their position. And this is what constitutes the tower defence mechanic. \n\nOn her Journey through the Pit, Azra meets new friends and foes, discovers the true origin of the plague and what has happened in the pit ...\n\nThe gameplay is classic tower defence with a litte bit of RPG mechanics thrown in. The game has six different types of heroes (towers), which each again can be recruited up to six times. Those heroes, as well as Azra, can gain levels through XP. With each new level a skill point is available for distribution amongst several different stats, spells and abilities. The heroes can also equip a weapon and armor each to improve their combat prowess. Next to XP, each combat rewards the player with \"scraps\", which act as local currency to buy equipment and recruit new heroes. \n\nThe game does not have any random element in its battles. But each battle comes in four different difficulties and can be replayed at any time to gain the higher rewards with a more experienced party. Beating a level without any damage to Azra gives special bonuses like extra money or unique items. After completing the game, several challenges are open to the player as well as a new game+ with increased difficulty."},"24892":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c76160f3-f831-4c88-8acd-eace2407b53d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Brawlhalla","Overview":"Brawlhalla: An eternal battle arena where the greatest warriors in history brawl to prove who's the best that ever was, is, or will be.

It has sunk below the surface and is now a subterranean archipelago surrounded by a large ocean, known as the Unterzee. The game is set in the same Victorian steampunk environment of Fallen London and borrows a lot of lore, but now as a game of strategic exploration instead of a pure RPG. At the start a past for the protagonist can be constructed, but it can also be determined at a later time. The captain can be a poet, a street urchin, a war veteran, an ordained priest or a philosopher. It determines a specific crew member, the starting amount of Echo (the main currency) and an extensive bonus for one of the main skills: veils (evasion), pages (knowledge), iron (damage), hearts (healing and morale) and mirrors (deception and perception). In addition a light-class steamer is provided as a first boat along with zailors (crew members), a mascot and a starting level for all skills. Crew member roles include a cook, a gunnery officer, a surgeon, a chief engineer, a first officer etc.\n\nThe next step is choosing an ambition, which determines the winning condition for the game. You can choose to become a venerated explorer (fullfillment), acquire a mansion and retire (wealth), discover your father's bones and bury them (your father's bones), establish a settlement where you rule (a private kingdom), or travel beyond the map's edge (the uttermost East). The rest of the story, past and development is based on the choices made during the game.\n\nStarting in Fallen London the goal is to explore with the ship and survive. Important parameters to track include the engine temperature, the amount of fuel (and tanks) left, hunger (and supplies), terror (zailors' morale), hull status and hold capacity. A Zee Bat can be sent out to search islands and report back. While exploring the lights can be turned off, which raises the terror meter, but reduces the chance of attracting monsters. Repairs can be done at ports, but also en route at the cost of supplies. Most of the information, actions and the many story fragments are grouped together in the Gazetteer. It offers an overview of the ship's contents in the hold (goods and curiosities), a journal and a detailed overview of the officers. When docked it offers access to the story elements, various shops and the shipyard. In main locations the cities and surroundings can be explored, new recruits can be hired, upgrades can be acquired and trade is possible. All of this is shown through text and images in the Gazetteer.\n\nWhile exploring the ship's speed can be determined and it is controlled through keyboard keys. Various ships and creatures are encountered that can be avoided or be battled. Through exploration experience is gained and entries in the logbook are triggered. Many locations can be discovered. Actions and challenges become available that further the story and these are all presented through text and options in the Gazetteer. Some of these only expand the story, while others provide new opportunities and rewards. Other ships can also be docked for similar events.\n\nDuring fights (which can also be avoided) a versus screen is shown with statistics such as health and crew (for ships) for both sides. There are different attack options, but these are only available if the opposition is illuminated sufficiently. The distance between the two parties also plays a role. Combat is turn-based. Selected actions are queued up and then both sides perform them in succession, simultaneously, as each type of action consumes an amount of time. Actions include attack, various types of illumination such as flares, setting the water on fire by spending oil or narrowing the distance, using various forms of evasion, and miscellaneous ones such as quick repairs or observation to study the enemy. Each action has advantages and drawbacks and many influence illumination of your ship and the enemy, which is one of the most important parameters during combat. It also possible to disengage and escape from the fight. The results of actions are shown through a log on the right with some visual effects. Loot, food and knowledge can be gathered for additional items or trade.\n\nTo survive the player carefully needs to manage the various resources and exploration options. The map is randomly generated for each session with only a few major shorelines in fixed positions. In the same way the story is not fixed and is it based on different fragments that are weaved together in different ways. It is possible to leave behind a legacy and pass on information, weapons, money, crew members, the chart or skills for the next adventurer. It is also possible to ignore the initial ambition and explore other opportunities and secrets instead.","ReleaseDate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00-08:00"},"25637":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c7903919-a980-4af2-9c06-565182e4b72d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74b0c91c-78fa-4037-b1fb-1179dc26e99d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"30838302-384a-4245-af01-3076ec49ab58.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty","Overview":"Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!, also known as Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee – New 'n' Tasty!, is a 2014 cinematic platform video game developed by Just Add Water and published by Oddworld Inhabitants for the PlayStation 4 as a \"ground-up remake\" of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.

The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings. \n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical\/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Ancient_Art_of_War"},"31281":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"b9a2f7c7-d597-4e32-9c1d-e74e1b015719.png","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty","Overview":"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game developed and released by Blizzard Entertainment for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

Wings of Liberty focuses on the Terrans, while the expansions Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void will focus on the Zerg and Protoss, respectively. The game is set four years after the events of 1998's StarCraft: Brood War, and follows the exploits of Jim Raynor as he leads an insurgent group against the autocratic Terran Dominion. The game includes both new and returning characters and locations from the original game.\n\nThe game was met with very positive reviews from critics, receiving an aggregated score of 93% from Metacritic. Similar to its predecessor, StarCraft II was praised for its engaging gameplay, as well as its introduction of new features and improved storytelling. The game was criticized for lacking features that existed in the original StarCraft game including LAN play and the ability to switch between multiplayer regions.

The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported and best-selling video games, and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games","Publisher":"Psygnosis","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lemmings_(video_game)"},"152653":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ICOM Simulations, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"0f2cd302-a341-4301-8fc4-f3e8bcb9d1f5.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"37c76a82-bad9-42a0-8a5a-5cd4cd89533e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dafd8f11-a5af-4ba0-ba1e-be787e08f6ec.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"91750769-603b-4dae-a9ad-8f367b3393c5.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a2a6b3ac-710a-4a26-b74d-86ff53ed3353.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c9294f0f-2d40-4c1f-a125-b74ad6a3fb0a.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"52a9025e-5a8b-4b00-8397-f820a70c7624.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"818c1dcb-833d-485b-9c43-100aacc2af76.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Uninvited","Overview":"Uninvited is a haunted house \"point-and-click\" adventure game developed originally for the Macintosh by ICOM Simulations released in 1986 by Mindscape.\n\nWhile driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car.

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human\/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself. Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a \"Fatality\" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale. Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.","Publisher":"Acclaim","ReleaseDate":"2020-03-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GBhm8kMVMVc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_II"},"177099":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Midway Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"7674c1c2-a72b-4dad-b73d-b702f9427f55.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"872d9fd8-75e3-44bd-badc-56b1fde8977b.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"054c34f1-b27a-4db1-b88e-fe5d9cf8a8ec.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Mortal Kombat 3","Overview":"Shao Kahn has won.

The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons.

However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.\n\nPool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.\n\nExploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also \"multi-class\" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pool_of_Radiance"},"177378":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mark Sumner","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fc41af3a-0c98-450f-8882-02338c8bb867.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"88bc9e75-9eba-4095-a72d-6c382c35cd6c.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"f20c4de2-1c51-4ad2-9b65-422a3f40b1e5.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9f45cec9-7aa0-49fd-93fa-0b33832f41ae.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wizard's Fire","Overview":"A fantasy-themed clone of Missile Command released as a shareware title in 1985.","Publisher":"CSI Design Group","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"178775":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullfrog","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"efd00765-0793-4355-b9d4-116fc431f166.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3fb37fdf-6342-4f74-b7fb-d4f5d64f1ab0.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Syndicate","Overview":"In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).

However, in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny, he was outgunned and had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Coarsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.\n\nFreddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click adventure game bearing many similarities to other Sierra titles in the same genre, in particular Leisure Suit Larry series. Players use the command bar at the top of the screen to choose a verb command that is combined with locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up.

He is the last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural forces of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.\n\nGabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g. Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games.\n\nThe game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically, Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.\n\nThe game's locations are done in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game adds full voice-overs to the dialogues, as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"179646":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"mindSports","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8068b1bb-c321-461d-9698-061b3baf4afc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1c315367-7573-44b1-a84a-87f969ff7de5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2ed190df-fb56-4979-b40f-0e6dc18aabc0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"08f973a7-e423-4be3-9cea-dd6494036c31.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Ground Zero","Overview":"A clone of Missile Command, with a few additions to set it apart from the original such as new enemy types.","Publisher":"mindSports","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"179647":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Parsoft Interactive","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"57726d0e-e530-49a1-9a67-2a1e007facc3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1139d75b-9bad-4da8-885d-b5e7e7e8466f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f0aa27d5-bb03-431a-a8af-2046c1199a18.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4f7bed84-3422-43b3-94eb-535e0cc0dba9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"79afa0c5-cff5-4348-987f-ffbbd76b3435.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aa2fd1f9-3166-4948-89ee-a2e32e07f338.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b4ef269a-d9f9-48fd-9ec5-38c4c357b7d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4acf0ad6-5963-4722-a69e-fcc5b95112ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hellcats over the Pacific","Overview":"Hellcats Over the Pacific is an early 1990's air combat simulator for the Macintosh platform.

Is there any way to prevent the disaster? Boston Low, a NASA veteran, is sent to command a space expedition on the asteroid. Accompanied by the journalist Maggie Robbins and the archaeologist Brink, Boston investigates the asteroid and finds a strange structure that undoubtedly belongs to an alien civilization. During the course of investigations, the team finds itself on a seemingly deserted planet. They have no knowledge of the planet and no possibility of going back. Will they ever discover the secret of this strange world and find a way to get home?\n\nThe Dig is a point-and-click adventure game with a simple one-cursor interface. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based, tending to be somewhat more complex than in most preceding LucasArts' adventure games. There are also a few logic-based puzzles, which require understanding and manipulation of alien technology and life forms on the planet. Traditional branching dialogue system is utilized; however, the game focuses more on puzzle-solving than on conversations to advance the plot.\n\nThe game's story is influenced by science fiction literature and movies, and strives to be realistic, departing from the comedy style of LucasArts' adventures. Despite that, humorous elements are present in some of the dialogues and text descriptions. The game utilizes hand-drawn graphics with a few pre-rendered 3D images.","Publisher":"LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Dig_(video_game)"},"179662":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Falcon: The F-16 Flight Simulator"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sphere, Inc.","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"a3d1cf2b-5756-4caa-9bd8-360623148ca1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4ba4755c-6e88-4423-8a0d-a68f10643983.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a8f3ee9d-1fab-4ccf-8520-164680df7dc3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f7fbc0a6-ad82-47f7-a9db-51d008488ccb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"003e4213-d64a-4cd1-9b5e-c9c5ce2f62f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Falcon","Overview":"The long Falcon simulation legacy of hardcore simulations of the F-16 fighter plane begins here.

The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?\n\nUnlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Use\" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to \"die\" in Larry 5, and the amount of \"dead ends\" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he\/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the \"right\" solution.

The game features a context-sensitive interface: clicking on an object brings forth a series of verbs which the player can choose in order to interact with the given object.

They were treated with suspicion by other guilds, who eventually accused them of practicing witchcraft and banned them to a secluded island, which they called Loom.\n\nBobbin Threadbare is a young man from the Guild of Weavers. He is outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times, though he does not know why. On his seventeenth birthday he is summoned by the Elders of the guild, who intend to decide his fate. However, shortly thereafter all the inhabitants of the village except Bobbin are turned into swans. Bobbin finds out that he is the child of the Great Loom, found by Lady Cygna, who tried to use the loom's powers to save the guild. Bobbin's stepmother Dame Hetchel teaches him the art of weaving magical drafts, and Bobbin embarks on a journey to find the lost flock, and the answers to his questions.\n\nLoom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called \"drafts\" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"179667":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Puzzle; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"5ee19412-bfe9-4252-b7aa-bb04b4fd64ec.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d4e11529-57a7-484c-bb12-628577f77b11.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cee1b1e0-8f4b-43dc-aec7-525cd5155197.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6b1dfd24-0b7e-47c9-82f8-5d14fee36c7f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"13929105-dd5d-445c-82cb-12a03e56be2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain","Overview":"This game is the third in the Dr. Brain series.

Some sections of the game require the player to be efficient driving the car (as there are a fair number of chases, and traffic rules also apply to the player).","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"179678":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MPS Labs","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"4c409433-311c-406d-95e4-d1a5eed4ac29.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9476fa86-22d5-4bfc-8c02-e0bc8e26cbea.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"93d478bf-cedf-4139-93fc-81f90333903f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4211674f-c112-4424-991a-33cd29609805.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a136ad7e-8ae5-4640-b93f-68c23a30b168.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon","Overview":"With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad!

Upon the completion of a rescue mission from the clutches of a mad scientist, the duo drives through the opening credits and immediately receives a new assignment: Bruno the Bigfoot is missing from the circus and seems to have kidnapped Trixie, the Giraffe-Neck Girl. Sam and Max are on the case and will follow the mystery all across the United States, even if it takes them to such locations as The World's Largest Ball of Twine and The Mount Rushmore Dinosaur Tarpit.\n\nSam & Max Hit the Road is a puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure game. The player directly controls Sam, though Max will usually follow closely behind and is even available to use directly as an item in the inventory. Sam is able to be directed anywhere on the screen, look at objects, try to use objects, try to speak to objects and use items from his inventory on objects. Sam and Max must unravel the mystery piece by piece in order to unlock new locations on their map. They can travel between these locations at any time by using the car keys on their police car.\n\nDuring conversation, the player is able to make Sam ask questions of persons, speak non-sequitur exclamations, or ask about specific objects, people, and locations (which are also unlocked as clues are discovered). The verb interface from previous LucasArts adventure games has been modified to icon-based commands, allowing the entire screen to be used for the playing area, similarly to Sierra titles.\n\nThe game also features a variety of mini-games, which can be accessed at any time once found. These include Highway-Surfing: a game where the player must jump over exit signs on the interstate, Car Bomb: a variant of Battleship, a Sam & Max coloring book, a Sam & Max dress-up game, and a Whac-a-Mole variant entitled Wak-A-Rat.

The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.\n\nThe puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous \"insult swordfighting\", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates.","Publisher":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"179683":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Evryware","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"dc9d39c7-3391-49e1-aeea-3b81832f7fed.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc4fe46d-d64e-4a8c-bf32-fc6704a85ffc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c5da546-e012-4997-9c5a-606aca84b628.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cc521bef-1ffe-4e6c-bec9-2a4517f47797.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sierra Championship Boxing","Overview":"One of the early Sierra On-Line releases, this game lets you design your own boxer before taking him\/her\/it to the ring.

While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.\n\nSpace Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.\n\nInterstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first.\n\nIt is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others.\n\nWhen docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.","Publisher":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","ReleaseYear":1989},"179689":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a0f3eb3a-f12c-46f6-bb28-67aaef17f8e0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2a552b1-d5ec-4c94-a3e3-3045dcd8af3a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a8c5f444-98f6-44d7-b31d-c46743da6e68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"254eddb7-46d1-4669-aef9-0161c9ab6ade.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Wars","Overview":"Star Wars is a first-person shooter based around the final scenes of the original Star Wars film.

The Kira colony was founded as political experiment for cooperation between seven divided alien races. After Lamina was destroyed by a nuclear war, the colony was on its own, and a certain Siboot founded a new civilization, based on a universal telepathic language called \"Eeyal\" and led by a Shepherd. Now the fourth and last Shepherd has died, and there is a fierce competition between the seven acolytes, including you, for his title.\n\nTo become Shepherd, you have to collect eight \"auras\" in three different areas -- tanaga (fear), katsin (trust) and shial (love). At night, the acolytes fight mental duels in a rock-paper-scissors kind, where success depends on knowing the aura ratings of the duelist -- which is why collecting as much information about the others' aura is crucial..\n\nEach morning you awake with the knowledge of one aura rating for each acolyte, and during the day, you try to collect as much information as possible by interacting with your competitors. All this is done an iconic representation of Eeyal, which allows for many ways of interaction like telling, asking, threatening, begging, accusing, promising, yelling, deriding, saying thanks or sorry or just expressing emotion or holding smalltalk. There also is some way of trading information by constructing sentences like \"if you tell me the tanaga count of X, I tell you the shial count of Y\" -- all this done by clicking small icons.\n\nEach competitor has its own personality, and they fear, trust and love each person differently. Everything you do will have effects on the way the acolytes react you, so you will have to find a careful balance between getting enough information and not abusing your allies. The same holds true for the all acolytes, the NPCs are constantly running around and talking to each other.\n\nIn between all that interaction, the game is interspersed by cutscenes which present you with a certain situation to which you can react in multiple choice style. It offers a save and restore function as well as three difficulty and three game length settings. The game came delivered with a manual and a novella by Chris Crawford which are very helpful to getting started.","Publisher":"Mindscape, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"179694":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"AcademySoft","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"c8f7b39d-90cd-40d2-8017-19b5f4f92d5f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d37afd02-970f-46ac-9f7d-8b57e485931b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"69ae2ca9-bda7-4ac1-842c-b35a0a914a28.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"643468c4-40d8-406f-a7d7-442a74602b9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9d446ab5-e17b-482a-aa1d-50e37a18c6e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tetris","Overview":"The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game.

As you found new cities and explore the surroundings, you may find hostile barbarians, villages, and other competing cultures. Once you have discovered another culture, you can adopt a policy of co-existence by signing a permanent peace treaty with that culture; you can even form a military alliance. But for those who like to conquer, you will find great satisfaction in deploying more than 50 different military units and crush your enemies. However, military is not the only aspect of this game. You will also need to concentrate on trade, science development, and make your people happy in order to avoid civil disorders.\n\nThroughout the game, you need to research technological advances, one after another, closely following the development of human civilization.

The player takes control of Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.\n\nFlashback: The Quest for Identity incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a \"cinematic platformer\" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.\n\nWhile a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.\n\nTo defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and complete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.\n\nMost of the versions utilize cutscenes with polygonal vector graphics. The CD versions replace those with pre-rendered 3D animations. The Sega CD version also features voice-overs.","Publisher":"MacPlay","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flashback_(1992_video_game)"},"179724":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"72a327a9-2914-4cd8-97a8-58c9fff72ba9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8fe6752-6fa3-4f6f-83db-3770ef5e4a0b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9df0fe83-e918-450f-9b30-d0bafde2c34d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5a60a246-0c01-48bd-aaa1-06da6b4298f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cedc0f04-b89f-4d5f-8a44-38375bbeb7b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Glider 4.0","Overview":"Glider puts you in the role of a paper airplane in its quest to find an open window and exit the house he's trapped on.\n\nYou have a rudimentary control of the plane (remember it's a paper plane) and must try to get through room after room of the house by riding currents of hot air, fans, etc. and avoiding danger in the form of balloons, furniture, paper shredders, etc. You can collect a series of power ups such as speed boosts, rubber bands (to shoot enemies with) folded paper (as lives) , etc.","Publisher":"Casady & Greene, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"179726":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infocom, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5d70e400-b47d-42f6-b32c-ed975b3b3ba6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"030ceaa1-9ce3-4732-96d8-9ecc385e9296.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4d775b3-8e62-4d43-ad6e-7eeda40388b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0603beee-4733-4086-934d-89ba70ba1819.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","Overview":"You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff.

Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.\n\nThe Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the game environment consists of maze-like passages made with pseudo-3D graphics.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player creates a party of six adventurers. There are six classes to choose from: knight, robber, sorcerer, cleric, paladin, and archer. Each character has six main attributes: might, endurance, accuracy, personality, intelligence, and luck, with each class requires proficiency in a specific attribute for effective functioning. There are also five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\n\nAs in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The party starts in a particularly weak state, equipped with only clubs and having no money. The player is free to explore most of the game's locations in any order, and there are few hints as to what needs to be done to advance the plot. Turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies typically take place against a group of monsters more or less equal in size to the player-controlled party, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain. It is also possible to try and bribe enemies or surrender to them before entering combat.\n\nThe game has no auto-mapping feature of any kind and it is only possible to save the player's progress at inns located in towns.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"179743":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Might and Magic II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"dd9c3ee0-2c8b-4d3a-a5bb-772d78a4c8ef.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"06b4dfcd-8984-4918-bebf-243bfc269697.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"157006ab-b06c-42ae-9a8b-ebf260ea92ff.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"44ea20de-b552-4908-8bf3-4af4f329e24d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World","Overview":"The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.\n\nGates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"179744":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Might and Magic III"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"cfedd840-5bed-4193-85a5-0e09674600a5.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fa869d1d-f202-462c-ae82-2f77e22e301b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7238baf-df57-4ccd-94de-364a11b38c58.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ceab6146-9e7e-4c07-8eab-2e3f661c3fe1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra","Overview":"A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON.

It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.\n\nIsles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.\n\nThis installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"179746":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Another World","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Delphine Software International","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"cfa02fc1-c485-43ef-9ba7-505d4030b6e3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4882d1f2-467e-48e4-af69-9e50a01ce2b4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"10ac93c5-3c71-4732-a451-517c82b86694.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2bccbeb5-6ed6-4981-b9d5-6be32ad662db.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Out of This World","Overview":"A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.\n\nOut of This World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.\n\nTypically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.\n\nEach level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.","Publisher":"MacPlay","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"179748":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infocom, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d63735d6-114a-4f10-88a6-b7ecfd7ed41b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7bcaf759-8451-48cf-9c5d-6f001be7fca3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e6ee3584-ffff-4019-a42b-cd7b2e4c21ef.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"caa04a1e-2b73-473a-8a80-10049bd2ac42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Planetfall","Overview":"It all started with your great-great-grandfather who was a High Admiral and one of the founding officers of the Patrol.

The goal is clear: explore the land and rid it of the evil, by taking on Bane's minions one by one...\n\nPools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good\/Evil and Lawful\/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.\n\nThe turn-based combat is done in similar style as other Gold Box games: the player navigates characters one by one on the top-down battle field, assigning various commands. Experience points are gained after successfully defeating enemies. Enemies appear randomly on the world map as well as in dungeons.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"179755":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WizardWorks Group, Inc.","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7e4a2155-f8e8-45df-a5c4-6d0a0245fe74.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4b697b8-d748-466e-ba6f-298ed7431e6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e2eec499-7b35-4524-bced-e092203c3e5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Prime Target","Overview":"Prime Target is a first-person shooter that makes use of the Marathon 2 engine.\n\nCathryn Mayfield, who was your friend and an influential senator, has been murdered in her office and now the building is swarming with armed mercenaries.

It turns out that Jaffar is alive and back for vengeance. Banished from the palace, the unfortunately Prince must travel to faraway lands and find a way to defeat the villain.\n\nPrince of Persia 2 is, like its predecessor, a cinematic platformer. Much of the gameplay is reminiscent of the first game, focusing on precise jumping puzzles, swordfighting, and overcoming many hazards in order to stay alive.

You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.\n\nThe game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American Revolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading\/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your colonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.\n\nEach of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony.

You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers).\n\nWhile you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you'll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more.\n\nApart from ammo and health, you can also find upgrades which have a number of beneficial effect - increasing your running speed, for example.","Publisher":"Bungie Software Products Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996},"182109":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kesmai Corporation","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"9bd1817e-3a9b-4e47-88f7-a901caa01e15.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"42a44364-cb89-48b5-951c-9e03784445db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Air Warrior","Overview":"Air Warrior was a multiplayer on-line air-combat simulator launched by Kesmai in 1988.

While testing the product Morlock inexplicably finds himself in the spaceship within the game. A hyperspace accident clones him thirty times. Each of the clones departs, taking with him a portion of a vital fluid that sustains Morlock's life. Assuming the persona of the brave Captain Blood, the programmer tracks down and disintegrated twenty-five clones, spending 800 years to achieve that goal. However, five clones still remain, hidden somewhere in the depths of the galaxy. Captain Blood must find these clones and destroy them before he loses his own life.\n\nCaptain Blood is an open-ended first-person adventure game. Much of the game consists of traveling to various planets and communicating with the aliens there to gather clues concerning the clones' whereabouts. The player commands a biological ship called Ark, and must launch probes onto planet surfaces, successfully navigating them through the landscape to locate an alien. The Ark can also scan planets and sometimes teleport aliens to different locations.\n\nConversations with the aliens are conducted via the so-called UPCOM interface. Over 150 icons are available to represent different concepts. Since each alien speaks his own language, the player must input various combinations of the icons to be able to understand the alien and communicate with him. Successfully concluding conversations may offer clues or unlock other planets. The protagonist's health deteriorates over the time, which affects the game's interface by making it more difficult to control. These symptoms may be reverted by disintegrating a clone.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Captain_Blood_(video_game)"},"183814":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Software Toolworks, Inc.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7c9ce0eb-c131-4493-875c-9a28a02073b3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"69b18485-188d-4686-88a9-9f11f39b6ad0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3712b573-d7bd-40d1-a466-c7b336bbcd8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Chessmaster 3000","Overview":"Chessmaster 3000 provides a strong chess opponent with 168 openings and different types of playfields (2D, 3D, and War Room).

The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.\n\nBuilding on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.\n\nWhile flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.\n\nWhile playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen.

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Bounty"},"183832":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"8d5dc59c-ee3a-430d-8c70-ae823496f6b0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0e36c391-53d1-443f-8e6c-326f9e86dc01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2aae3ac9-7a6e-435e-963b-0c22927189f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Might and Magic: World of Xeen","Overview":"World of Xeen combines two games - Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen - into a single game that can be played continuously.

When a player fulfills a certain condition (such as the number of tenants), a VIP visits the building, and if his impression is favourable, the rating goes up, unlocking more rooms and facilities to expand the tower. The goal is to reach the ultimate level, and place an attraction (such as a chapel or a baseball field) on the top floor.\n\nThere are several rooms to expand your tower, usually starting with stores and restaurants plus hotel rooms (which provide daily income), expanding to offices, condominiums and apartments and other tenancy rooms. However, all these rooms need extra support in the form of facilities such as restrooms, vigilance rooms, as well as convention centers to attract more visitors or simply please your tenants. They must be always happy, or you risk seeing them leave if they aren't happy with the time it takes to move between locations or if there's too much noise.\n\nOne of the key aspects in the game is balancing the transport system - elevators, stairs and escalators. There are thee kinds of elevators: Simple, Express or Service. Simple elevators provide floor-to-floor operation (although you can choose not to stop at a particular floor), Express work in 15 floor intervals and Service are used only by stores and general tower staff (security and cleaning). More than one elevator can be added to a shaft, but each shaft has a limit on the floors it can cover.

If Graham takes these treasures back to the royal castle, then the ailing King Edward the Benevolent of Daventry will hand over the crown. During his travels, Graham will meet characters that will either help or hinder him.\n\nKing's Quest is commonly considered the progenitor of third-person-perspective adventure games. As opposed to earlier graphic adventures, the player is able to navigate the protagonist on screen in eight directions, creating an effect of three-dimensional exploration. The player character can also be obscured from view when hiding behind an object, is subjected to gravity, and has different animations for actions such as picking up an item, falling, swimming, etc. Graham can be moved around with arrow keys and perform various actions when the player types commands, normally consisting of noun and verb combinations (e.g. \"Take flower\", \"Talk man\", etc.).\n\nThe game world consists of a cyclic outdoor area with places of interest (houses, characters, etc.) that must be found through exploration. Much of the kingdom is accessible to Graham from the beginning, and there are only a few restrictions imposed on traveling. In order to complete the game, the player has to procure certain items and use them in correct situations or with specific characters. Some of the puzzles rely on fairy tales, and a good knowledge of those makes them easier to solve.\n\nThe game awards the player points for most of the actions he makes Graham perform. Since some of those are not crucial to completion, it is quite possible to finish the game without having attained the full score. Some of the tasks in the game have multiple solutions, though the game may grant the player less points if he chooses the simpler one. Many hazards await Graham on his journey, and death is frequent if the player is not careful. The game can also be rendered unwinnable by failing to collect a specific item or wasting it.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Quest_I"},"184509":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2595ae21-4cc4-412d-a21e-7742186882ab.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7cdf25bd-4f52-4bd4-8f42-8934ba6d23a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ba207dab-ec7c-4dab-b8f6-456d00db6292.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne","Overview":"After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king.

Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\". The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.\n\nAs with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Quest_V"},"184515":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"20f526e9-3a5f-4eaf-9979-a2ac4cf1c771.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"df3a2b04-efab-4e13-bc4e-6a4c47f953c2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a0bd4ac8-8414-4362-9be0-ebd184664259.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow","Overview":"For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.\n\nLike its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs (\"walk\", \"examine\", \"use\", \"talk\", etc.).","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Quest_VI"},"184522":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d08bc7be-2423-450d-bba3-e51a889c401a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"35333184-705b-4c87-94da-e3b100c2aebc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"efe6bacb-b9f9-4ab3-8251-33db77853716.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards","Overview":"Larry Laffer is a short, tacky, balding, forty-year-old man who has been living with his mother until recently. He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game.\n\nThe game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use. Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories. The main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics. The game features a day\/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"184529":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arxel Tribe","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"00d09df3-98a9-4534-a16b-810db0851333.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"706e79e9-bf22-4665-bc40-11c4b0ba1ed9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"def3c3d6-75fc-47ad-b548-77401531836e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3e5e6dff-d61e-4203-b36e-77136f45dbfd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6f5a60d8-607a-4926-967c-c64133aa4138.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ring: The Legend of the Nibelungen","Overview":"Ring is an interactive science fiction opera adventure, a 3D graphical adventure set in the 40th century that follows the story of Richard Wagner's epic opera Ring of the Nibelungen.

Ships can land at planets, stations, and some other stellar objects.

At spaceport bars, you can gamble, hire escort ships, watch the news, and sometimes receive additional unique missions.\n\nStar systems are controlled by different governments which may be friendly, restrict some areas or are openly hostile. You can change status towards them by taking missions from them, attacking their enemies, and destroying pirates. If you help opposing governments, attack the government's or their allies' ships, or pirate civilians, your status will worsen with them.

His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\nPrince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platformer genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/xjRZvnGR02o","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)"},"200925":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Randy Reddig","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"23458207-a232-4e5e-9c49-fe41a640f3c1.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"35c3e965-9277-4143-851d-b7b75417de5c.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1753bf8e-83c6-4f61-96cb-98688c7bb145.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bdef2ccb-0d8e-4113-9f7b-3e48635f8524.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Troubled Souls","Overview":"Troubled Souls is a Pipe Dream derivative, but not a clone.

It was announced at the computer's launch and was featured in the original brochure, but its release was delayed until a couple of months later. \n\nThe packaging is quite unique. Since this is an Alice in Wonderland themed game, the packaging is meant to look like Lewis Carroll's famous novel. It opens like a book to reveal the 400K floppy disk inside.\n\nThe game is a chess game of sorts. The board is viewed with a depth-perspective so that pieces and squares appear smaller the further away they are.\n\nAt first, 6 chess pieces are lined up at front of the board and you choose which piece you want Alice to take on the moves of. Once the game starts, Alice (seen from a behind-view) must capture all pieces on the board. All pieces will hop around in arcing moves above the board and you as Alice must click on squares that are valid to move to according to the abilities of the piece you chose at start. If you are captured, your score decreases, and increases based on the value of pieces taken. A perfect score of 999 is only possible if you allow all the pawns to become queens before capturing them.\n\nThere is an options screen if you hold your mouse pointer over the score. The Cheshire Cat appears on-screen and you can alter the game speed, flip the board upside-down or activate holes to appear randomly on chess board which capture any piece unlucky to be on that square.\n\nThe game disk also contained some extras such as fonts and a maze generator game called Amazing.","Publisher":"Apple Computer","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"200938":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Synergy Inc","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"80042b79-a9c8-4998-ae18-6f712e6ae299.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b119fff1-cc3f-40a1-a961-c83daaa1d98d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56b2abef-73f1-4593-949b-a9cfb40818db.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"77e8b641-7447-4be7-820b-094c8bd670a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Alice: An Interactive Museum","Overview":"The player searches through a museum of twelve rooms for a deck of 53 cards, upon which are clues which will lead to the last room and the end game.
