The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.\n\nThe player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).\n\nAliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same). If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will \"capture\" that character (indicated by a yellow status light). The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them. If not, the captured character will be lost.\n\nAmmunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WAFr2V1aNoE"},"135661":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Conversion Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"23e550b5-6768-4d8d-9209-7d78274482a5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"455d1324-a78b-4a80-9eb6-9414bca9699d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bomb Jack","Overview":"In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one.

Humanity has established colonies on the moon, Mars, and several of the larger asteroids. Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats, and the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is quantum black holes.\n\nIn Starcross, you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. STARCROSS, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time will be different.\n\nThe ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.\n\nAs you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Starcross_(video_game)"},"138548":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami Industry Co.

But hey, while you're at it, you might as well try to get some money off your unplanned stay on Targ.\n\nYou're a mercenary, and it just so happens that the two races on the planet are at war. So why not use that to your advantage and do some favors for each race... against cash?\n\nYou play this game in a first-person perspective with vector graphics. There's a huge planet for you to explore, you can walk around on it or take airborne vehicles to reach elevated locations.\n\nMercenary: The Second City is an expansion disk for Mercenary, which features the same gameplay and controls.\n\nFollowing the successes over Targ's Central City, the controller of the BENSON computer relaxes and enjoys himself. Soon however, he grows bored and starts looking around for new challenges on the still hazardous Planet Targ. Rumors about the Palyar Commander's brother-in-law living in the southern hemisphere suggest that this may be a good challenge.

But he is back, and he is still wandering around abandoned mine workings looking for treasure. Having managed to escape from the old Klondike mine (which was infested with monsters and kept flooding) he stumbled across another abandoned mine to explore. This one used to be owned by a rather unscrupulous mining company called 'Rock Bottom Mining Corporation'. They were looking for gems, and found lots, but they also found some other things down there too. Some good, some not so good. Eventually, despite the riches that they were extracting from the mine, they had to abandon it. They left lots of things down there in their rush to leave...\n\nPete is now on his new quest – to get through all the caves of the mine workings, gathering as many gems on the way as he can, solving puzzles, fighting monsters, and trying not to get stuck.\nHe will encounter lots of obstacles on the way. The caves are littered with boulders, which will come crashing down if he is not careful. Pete has been working out, and he is able to push and pull boulders to clear a path, and attack things.\n\nThere are numerous monsters lurking in the mine. Some have very poor eyesight and will feel their way around by following the walls. They are often quite anti-social and do not like meeting other types of monsters. Maybe he can use that to his advantage? Some other monsters (who appear to have escaped from a 1980's classic arcade game) are a bit smarter. They wander the caves and are always on the lookout for Pete, or one of their opposite number. If they see Pete, they will chase him down, unless he can outwit them. If they see one of their opposite number, its best to stand clear!\n\nThe deeper parts of the mine can contain a mysterious and much prized substance called Gemanium. Looking and behaving a lot like a boulder, it twinkles in the darkness. Be warned: it is radioactive, and if you get too much of It together in one place it will reach critical mass. Stand back!","Publisher":"Public Domain\/Freeware","ReleaseDate":"2020-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?time_continue=1&v=o-qoc70HAyk&feature=emb_logo"},"186603":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"859f0bd8-47cd-4fb2-a712-b2e6c1df72f1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e0e04f97-8814-4535-b7a5-4a458e3eb70d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"946432fc-2c11-4cb0-bc38-4b398a86273f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"618c1c4c-2188-4659-8488-ebdb7ab73a82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"93356c1f-fb5c-4327-8ebd-38d61f5b0927.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"3-D Glooper","Overview":"3-D Glooper is a version of Pac-Man where you must move about a maze-like city eating blue blocks while trying to avoid the baddies called Gloopers that roam it.

The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through.

You must aim in front of the birds, so as to allow for the distance they will cover as the bullet travels. In the third level you are now shooting at bad guys, who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on an accurate Wild West layout.\n\nThe second level sees you attempting to jump over rocks and cacti, whereas level 4 involves jumping across a speeding train in order to wrestle control of it.","Publisher":"Mastertronic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986}}
