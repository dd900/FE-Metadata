The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.\n\nThe player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).\n\nAliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same). If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will \"capture\" that character (indicated by a yellow status light). The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them. If not, the captured character will be lost.\n\nAmmunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAFr2V1aNoE","Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter; Strategy","Developer":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"a7028aaf-cc04-4f68-9424-f39eed7dd775.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"213d1147-3f89-4bfb-87d1-6c36f77a67d7.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"9c92e32d-e13b-4d3f-aeac-6487419a76a3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"c6764778-f206-45ff-aa61-fabf86399e11.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"f962b162-607d-4201-a6c1-48160a2ac60c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"78f2549c-44cd-4b8f-8426-69b6ffaf759d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"051eb091-d666-4503-a4fd-1cff225c19f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135659,"FileName":"b836d5fe-14ac-4bbd-86bc-d9c06cddb55a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179107,"Name":"Alpharay","ReleaseYear":"2019","Overview":"The team that brought you the stunning scrolling platformer Pets Rescue are BACK with yet another incredible release for the expanded C16 and standard Plus/4 computers.

If you get the question wrong, the computer chooses a square (seemingly with no strategy). In two player games each player has their own buzzer, and a correct answer sees you choose the next question.

The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all these for a par-12 challenge.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186649,"FileName":"e2910572-6773-4669-adf8-1a5a48c11057.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186649,"FileName":"ce17798c-7c62-4cf4-ae7d-a6727645a714.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186649,"FileName":"6fc9f686-dc02-4738-95be-03abebe72504.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186649,"FileName":"7b3def82-7aba-481e-8c33-27dbd6575599.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186649,"FileName":"e705d494-1dff-449b-8e2c-6b817d927dee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186649,"FileName":"e3ef7782-2631-4bbb-90fa-3cc244b4c5e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":161892,"Name":"Crillion","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Crillion is similar to Breakout except there is no paddle and the player controls the ball directly.

The player takes control of Sparkie, a blobby yet spikey character who is lost in the haunted catacombs beneath the ruins of an old monastery. Ghosts and other nasty creatures wander around the corridors of the catacombs and now Sparkie has to find a way to escape. Unlike Pac-Man, Exorcist doesn't feature any pills that has to be collected. Instead the idea here is to illuminate all of the walls of the mazes. This is done automatically as the player moves Sparkie through the corridors. When a maze is fully lit the ghosts will be exorcised and a number of exists will open up and the player can move on to other mazes. All mazes are connected to each other and the player can move back and forth between them. If Sparkie comes into contact with the ghosts he will have to restart the maze and he will lose some of his energy. When all energy is lost the game is over. It is possible to shoot at the ghosts by picking up lightning that can be found in each maze. This causes the ghosts to slow down but it can only be used for a few second before it disappears. Energy can be replenished by shooting the exorcised ghosts.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186654,"FileName":"66c6f9b2-bf90-47cf-830c-52b4c198f3da.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186654,"FileName":"96ea13e8-cf74-4243-b45c-36a87cb84b1e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186654,"FileName":"455d3871-d42c-49bd-a992-4bd47b8f42a9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186654,"FileName":"a87e52a2-6b80-437b-9a95-ec70d555867b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186654,"FileName":"011f90d6-716e-46b0-9ad2-8237b882c7d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186654,"FileName":"567b627a-ad08-4a95-8690-05767f535d13.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164171,"Name":"Fire Ant","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"You control an ant that must rescue the queen ant taken hostage by a group of scorpions.

Players move a space ship left and right to fire at a group of alien ships near the top of the screen. They fire bullets and come swooping down like a kamikaze. Based on the colour they have different behaviour and some of them require multiple hits. To finish the stage all aliens have to be defeated. The wave is repeated in every stage, but enemies gradually become faster. Just like in the regular Galaga, the largest enemies can move down and fire a fixed beam that makes the area smaller to move. After a number of stages a Challenge Stage can be accessed with a new pattern. The player receives a bonus there based on the number of kills. You start with three lives. A bonus ship is awarded at 20,000 points and then at every 70,000 points.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Thomas Landgraf","Publisher":"Kingsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"92648ca2-f28c-494f-9962-9dd66fb75d66.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"ec39c3f8-68d9-43d8-9882-03afb5dacfb8.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"49bf0a95-5687-4e9c-8cb5-4a005629e2e7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"0f73e7be-4f56-4a03-b97e-9d548c7a8349.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"4ba0d753-0df3-4a21-8584-317eac32176c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"7b3c5049-71a6-43aa-9c97-d4850ec46cf5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202186,"FileName":"3afdc020-a9a0-4750-a268-06aaf162144b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194532,"Name":"Ghost Town","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Once a prosperous place to live, your town has been turned into a Ghost Town by the evil wizard Belegro with a spell.

The idea of the game is to drive so many miles estimating the answer to a sum, in the quickest time. Before you start the race you can choose your car depending on the speed you want to drive and whether you want a full race or just practise. At the start of the race you start to accelerate and drive along a road split into four lanes where you can move left or right into them.\n\nA sum appears at the bottom of the screen and at the bottom of each lane is an estimation of the answer. You drive in a lane with what you think is the correct answer for half a mile before the answer is revealed. If correct you keep driving with a new sum, get it wrong and you are stopped and a Marshall appears telling you the correct answer. As you drive, every five miles an obstacle starts to appear and they are oil-slicks which mix the answers when hit, rocks which stop you and give a new sum, and finally night driving where you have to drive in a lane to reveal one of the answers. At the end of the race you enter the pits to be given a score.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing; Education","Developer":"Applied Systems Knowledge Ltd.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186682,"FileName":"dbd84c1c-e7f2-499c-9979-10126c76f49e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186682,"FileName":"33ccc8e3-5d73-464a-87ca-ec9cbca78c01.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186682,"FileName":"45da6335-0686-4d43-aee1-37ea7a3fb5d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186682,"FileName":"0f8cfb14-87aa-43fc-804a-db6c92a570aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186682,"FileName":"39ddef95-c5c3-483f-94a6-50ef6c7a9eca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186683,"Name":"Oblido","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Oblido is an arcade puzzle game where you have to move four sets of nine counters made up of different colours and patterns into the same coloured reception area over various levels.

If you touch the water then you lose a life (three on the C64, five on the C16) and you start on the left of the river again with any fruit collected lost. The first few levels has just one turtle moving up and down, but later levels has multiple turtles moving. Before the start of the game you can select the starting level (0-9). \n\nThe game is very similar to the Nintendo Game & Watch game Turtle Bridge which came out in 1982.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdEQ7dKUSo8","Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Richard Moore","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"66906291-04e2-4f46-aca2-ea0ee2067009.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"55ae7930-7a13-4992-9f12-274074cc6d67.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"5459ba2e-0f46-40ad-a767-3d84b7e1436d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"9c04f7bf-fe8a-4909-9950-a11e34e8400c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"50859f8d-32a3-4e0f-8d57-e60c48ccbad5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"fa769ec7-2645-4071-884c-55af2d1aba4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167550,"FileName":"e93c359f-9dda-4aac-b1da-969d6e559bca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165720,"Name":"Questprobe featuring The Hulk","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"1st in the Questprobe Marvel Comics series.

Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S.

To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.\n\nAs you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole.

But he is back, and he is still wandering around abandoned mine workings looking for treasure. Having managed to escape from the old Klondike mine (which was infested with monsters and kept flooding) he stumbled across another abandoned mine to explore. This one used to be owned by a rather unscrupulous mining company called 'Rock Bottom Mining Corporation'. They were looking for gems, and found lots, but they also found some other things down there too. Some good, some not so good. Eventually, despite the riches that they were extracting from the mine, they had to abandon it. They left lots of things down there in their rush to leave...\n\nPete is now on his new quest – to get through all the caves of the mine workings, gathering as many gems on the way as he can, solving puzzles, fighting monsters, and trying not to get stuck.\nHe will encounter lots of obstacles on the way. The caves are littered with boulders, which will come crashing down if he is not careful. Pete has been working out, and he is able to push and pull boulders to clear a path, and attack things.\n\nThere are numerous monsters lurking in the mine. Some have very poor eyesight and will feel their way around by following the walls. They are often quite anti-social and do not like meeting other types of monsters. Maybe he can use that to his advantage? Some other monsters (who appear to have escaped from a 1980's classic arcade game) are a bit smarter. They wander the caves and are always on the lookout for Pete, or one of their opposite number. If they see Pete, they will chase him down, unless he can outwit them. If they see one of their opposite number, its best to stand clear!\n\nThe deeper parts of the mine can contain a mysterious and much prized substance called Gemanium. Looking and behaving a lot like a boulder, it twinkles in the darkness. Be warned: it is radioactive, and if you get too much of It together in one place it will reach critical mass.

The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Plus 4","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Beam Software Pty., Ltd.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186725,"FileName":"465c3a2e-102a-42e1-8557-61bcde530c33.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186725,"FileName":"3c1ccf69-1b53-4067-be99-7442d4930c60.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186725,"FileName":"5d363178-16ed-4299-a957-e4978acc530e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":186725,"FileName":"6b7468aa-4e8e-4480-92f4-f597c8f33ed3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":186725,"FileName":"fc2eeb75-aa8a-4b10-ab5c-d62102379f86.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":186725,"FileName":"7e48e210-69e7-4deb-99c7-1382f8888fa1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186725,"AlternateName":"The Way of the Exploding Fist","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":32075,"Name":"Winter Events","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Winter Events is a multi-sport event game heavily influenced by the classic Winter Games.
