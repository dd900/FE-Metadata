Set in a desert-bound, high-tech metropolis a swordsman with no name is nearly all that is left of the once powerful Kusagari-clan. A clan known as \"the Jackals\", lead by one known as \"Payne\", are responsible and now it is the Swordsman's duty and you're to avenge the fallen Kusagari. \n\nRed Steel 2 is a single player first-person shooter developed exclusively for Wii and designed to utilize the Wii Remote's optional MotionPlus technology. Players will pick up the Wii Remote and swing it freely as the sword on-screen follows their precise movement - and even measures the strength of their swing. With this added ability of the Wii MotionPlus to sense the strength of a swing, you will literally be able to make an impact on your adversaries through power and precision and even engage multiple pistol-packing enemies at once, deflecting bullets with precise sword strokes. Along with less stylish actions, players rack up points through executing combos, finishing moves and other actions as members of the rival Jackal clan are eliminated. Additional abilities and weapons are earned or are available for purchase as victories pile up.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2010-03-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mJJ79gzxTSA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Red_Steel_2"},"827":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Biohazard: The Darkside Chronicles","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"23ee0e75-9c68-4741-ac32-779114c4f10b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"899cb028-898e-4185-991d-a72794107c68.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5c8e4c65-ba41-45d6-a958-8e1646712ecf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6ae07ce-4fdd-46c0-9803-eb18a6d89274.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"88dcd83c-7b2f-456d-8e4d-b6387298e696.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0da45738-94a9-4839-89b6-67f2f08f290e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a5fcddeb-a350-48f4-813d-36b418e866dc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d5839c40-b312-432c-ab66-ac232b0c53f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6073e460-cb3d-4746-9262-4cf39be6b48c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"092aaa1c-26e0-4e0a-ba75-d074ac1400b8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0b667b37-548c-4a68-92ef-19678e1e2f51.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"50ef02e7-8f71-4740-aa59-3c1f58d87868.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1fbd182d-a7c9-439a-9b00-04aa2e560d23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e3344389-f6e3-45c1-bc59-13bf71db09d7.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5d280364-14c1-416b-a181-30f572a299be.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"10bf8994-8e0f-43ed-b916-adf9f6b77fac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"75a8c41d-abce-47f4-a362-ab164db0f983.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0790d927-274c-42d8-82c5-9b3b73095af7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles","Overview":"The Darkside Chronicles is an on-rails shooting game.

During the course of the game the player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements. Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies: a 3rd person platformer.\n\nThe sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time).\n\nIn co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-03-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"3194":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo EAD","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c94c3072-731f-4f71-8fef-2adc882381c8.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c994c23d-3e82-437b-9e80-5b31597b8d20.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c4e1c1f0-9098-40c2-b502-c3e85e4e0f05.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b098e7f7-d811-4f75-bf53-a51075024ff1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1dd889a9-5661-4049-b223-b364520cbe9c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"307075fe-7a34-4c3b-8b8a-b1d525ee6694.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1ddcba75-335b-40a6-ad55-e06539099f55.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"44c12c40-6170-4a57-8e25-2d76d141562a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f585b75e-934e-45ea-a0fe-29ca6bbce972.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d64fb466-66c4-40ef-aa40-1b41cc0a31d4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"454f369e-f2c4-443e-b7b1-7d0759ae961d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5779c79e-1ba6-40c1-b579-449f3e86a83d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2d6d9ca7-98d0-451f-a4c6-77d26aca5ee6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1b619776-88a4-40c2-aae0-f2d47b7900ca.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Wii Sports Resort","Overview":"Set off on a journey to a tropical island where an array of fun activities await.

The hub has also been redesigned; where before each hub was a small area with easy access to levels which had been unlocked, now each hub is a large area in which entrances to levels must be discovered.","Publisher":"LucasArts","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iZjRqZdblFc"},"3782":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"LEGO Indiana Jones: La Trilogia Original","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"48bb5412-521b-4bda-87af-4d3fbf2ddd61.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0c775c9f-05dd-4159-989d-713ee0db0cf3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d40b13d5-36f3-4c30-86e7-dc48da783ee2.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"35b5a9ad-92a3-4b55-b78f-2d3f51464b48.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"629752a3-13a0-4ff8-b464-c1db3809a3eb.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"33243f43-8921-4891-ba61-26e25d52e9d3.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"076ccbea-6a4d-4841-85fe-52b4906d118f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4421861d-484f-4484-b611-f99a68cb09c7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49d4fdad-aa0c-444c-94f8-e5d867f3263b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eaa12fc5-7ffd-4a31-95c6-6bce96a87d53.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"88e2e11c-4c12-43b6-a926-292112318815.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8f90da0c-97eb-49df-9900-884dc9566e8d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"835cd45c-2322-4cf2-b385-9e18de4f4a48.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f84e9665-08a2-491f-b5f4-dd14d964979f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"63b29f7c-5bf5-4ad2-97c2-68dab11a12be.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures","Overview":"The game allows players to recreate moments (albeit more humorously) from the first three Indiana Jones films: Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nHowever, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into 6 game chapters per movie.

During the action players use the Wii Remote to direct objects and forces toward structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of them as possible, but without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this players have to deal with the different types of blocks in play. Some of these include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks. In addition, as the game progresses strategies may change, meaning that players must be flexible in order to succeed.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-05-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"4407":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Visceral Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fdb7d7bf-64b4-4cee-b37a-623447e4c044.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8718f9ab-83e1-4534-b489-71d74207eff4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"462e2550-7a6d-4016-b837-bf557fe8f707.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f1273a8f-65d1-486f-91c7-671d28afba2c.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ec245e18-9ff0-4871-97ff-65bbd3b4c669.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"08598ad8-04b7-4c16-9ebd-e89b5a700b57.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5b8808af-de56-42a6-817e-b3f5ab49df1a.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cb78fa0d-1f2e-4a70-a4fc-9533222fa5f6.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b55894df-20c5-4254-85d8-5400421c720e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fe241f88-d6dd-419b-a92c-6b372994003d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9f8d763b-dfd3-4602-a044-16dc8f763257.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"20afb2df-44eb-4590-a847-d7e8e6b2e5e2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"63c319bd-4f3e-4c02-9075-821b754ffcc8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7186dbeb-8bcf-485d-aeb1-06f646ad82ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1e96b26d-0232-45c5-9d5c-aadbde501fd3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3402fefa-b8c0-44d4-baad-45a9cf89eac2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"06987c76-c378-4adb-8200-e614c4a618ca.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ce5d276e-9614-401a-ab31-2b6ce2fed855.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b4a53bf8-16e9-4c89-a485-fae354dbb6b1.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"44afb355-b2a4-403c-98ae-485d3a6a4971.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df4e4b3d-4089-4640-934c-5e368dfe0cde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dead Space: Extraction","Overview":"A horrific infection is devastating the Aegis VII mining colony located deep in the furthest regions of space.

But this culture is threatened; Tokugawa's thirst for power leads to a conflict over the enormously powerful, though cursed, Demon Blades. Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness, and untimely deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits -- and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well.\nFeaturing hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa: The Demon Blade transports players into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilizing their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.","Publisher":"Ignition Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rKl0o3B4Sr4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muramasa:_The_Demon_Blade"},"4429":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"大神","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Okami","Region":"United States"},{"AlternateName":"Okami"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Clover Studio","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ace14387-7d1b-4e3c-b338-a51ff2ab23d8.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0966fb2a-8d20-4ef3-b98a-e4833938d23b.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"13ca9010-6201-43f1-9fd7-584fa5717699.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"409f2926-9071-43e8-a61c-f70d26dc5724.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"80eaae0e-6eb4-405a-8284-058d2b5cb3d7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e2efc693-7999-4190-a85b-ada1c953560a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d665dba5-a0c9-4adb-b0bd-ac4170093865.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e021669-c283-4ffa-9d23-94b1fd878cd2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bd17bddb-6cc9-4cfa-b9b4-0555bb30b94c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a012ef17-581a-443a-8386-d747f342353a.PNG","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"520acbde-2d79-404c-9c4b-38a3e0691f56.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9e4c9f6b-1cbe-4018-9d81-a08a15685aa7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d7f00437-2955-417c-b45f-c024e0b5b69f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f5bad9d8-8fa0-41fb-a649-7ad53c497d78.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e5c0afc2-eddc-4667-8e05-1bd08f674eef.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6a42deb8-adf9-40b3-8a3a-a7813b1d36d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"15841adb-4b1d-4882-bf94-7dc0494720a5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ae0a5686-be0b-4227-8dfa-623c9da8087c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"30313c30-7656-4041-98cc-ccf57c85c47d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"abfb5518-0338-455e-915e-3188171e847f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a81a95f3-57fd-42eb-84f7-e139ebee1276.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b4ac323a-50e3-496f-87fc-f9b801736e43.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ōkami","Overview":"Wii port of the first original title from Capcom's now defunct Clover Studio -- headed up by Viewtiful Joe producer Atsushi Inaba.The multiple award-winning action adventure Ōkami is now available on the Wii!

The player is free to explore the school campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities or get new items.\n\nSchool classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at the dorm.","Publisher":"Rockstar","ReleaseDate":"2008-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2DPhTb4J2Eg"},"4971":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visual Concepts","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1436ad3c-4755-411a-bd49-41a821807967.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4934fbb7-2a5e-4d45-9ec7-ce060bf9f92a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"52fa1a17-9288-4a28-9c4f-2e8cac97d8ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a82701cc-dfbe-4a03-988f-d42ad94b712d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"67e96f75-55d0-4525-9856-39e28e6e9ca9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"NBA 2K10","Overview":"NBA 2K10 is a basketball video game based on the National Basketball Association developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports.

The Autobots intend to protect it for good, while the Decepticons desire its power for evil. The two factions fought their battle on the planet Cybertron, but in an ultimate attempt to protect it, the Autobots hurled the AllSpark into space where it remained hidden on Earth. When the Decepticons discover the location, they want to finish the war on Earth.\n\nSet in a 3D sandbox environment with possibilities to interact and destroy the environment, players can choose between the two teams, each with different story-based goals. These are set on different locations, with primary and secondary quests. The storyline for the heroic Autobots follows the plot and events of the original movie. The storyline for the villainous Decepticons, however, allows the robots to destroy both the planet and more aggressively bring an end to their foes. Players can choose characters such as Optimus Prime or Bumblebee from the list of selectable Autobots, or Megatron and Starscream from the Decepticons.\n\nShown from a third-person perspective, the robots can switch between a robot and a vehicle\/aircraft form, jump, block, dive underground, roll, dodge, use various weapons, and climb buildings. Special actions can be unlocked through the skill tracker. By performing long slides or jumps, symbols in the tracker will light up and provide extras.\n\nAlong the way, various collectibles can be found, ranging from promo images and artwork, to playable versions of the original \"Generation 1\" characters. The general gameplay is identical across the different platforms, but certain features are tied to specific versions.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2007-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"4988":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cavia","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3cf9c6b8-5a3a-429c-8b3b-68a6963a6261.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dbf13758-d28c-4704-80f1-2bf28ed8e06b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4965a519-55ae-426a-8508-cc6dbc98262f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f4a4ff51-2b7f-403e-a769-c8a273a68bca.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7fcd7b93-0297-42dd-8bb3-97de609bfefd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e3b06268-00b7-4dd4-b1c5-de1555763aa2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"187ceedf-481a-4bde-a05a-1aaa45dec273.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b970f6ff-bb11-4c19-b717-1f070c17156f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2c89c87b-f333-4263-a59d-911f458b45e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"SEGA Bass Fishing","Overview":"Sega Bass Fishing is an arcade fishing game where players attempt to hook and reel in fish with different lures. It uses a fishing rod controller. Consisting of four stages at different times of the day, the game requires the player to catch a certain weight of fish within a time limit in order to move onto the next stage. The final stage allows only for one fish to be captured, but are among the largest in the game and most difficult to catch. Fish are measured under four weight classes: Small One, Average, Big One, and Huge.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game was released for the Wii on February 26, 2008. The game utilizes the motion controls of the Wii Remote and optionally the Nunchuck to replicate the Sega Fishing Controller. The game's graphics have been enhanced and it includes the modes, features, stages and unlockables found in the Dreamcast version. The Wii version also introduces seven more stages, bringing the number to fifteen. Arcade mode now consists of courses, with the final course unlocking the original four arcade stages. Nature Trip mode is also introduced, allowing players to practice without the background music playing.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2008-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"4989":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sonic Team","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"39a521cc-c967-44df-86d4-a532bc78597d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fb1c75a2-062d-4d94-9a8b-6d5e1a7f3d2e.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c740042b-3762-4cc5-a66e-1ca049122ae6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cc6cbe09-1ec8-43bd-8fe5-127588916254.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7832872a-e138-44ad-890f-a4d1acae2851.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e226226a-0f06-4965-8692-02b909a10051.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"09d264a9-d857-4867-91d2-8e9c5f74ce09.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f563a356-82f6-486c-9fd1-c1b0920ae53d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eb51fcfa-cb1d-42c7-91c7-583dd97c9541.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6fe7c4fd-356e-4647-98e7-39a222cc2816.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"07ca2975-c4fd-4abd-8f39-7da7de3345d2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ab855709-03e1-4323-a2d8-649b85f1d785.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0041d39c-b03d-47f8-bac7-3cf9fe4ac740.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d617366c-e366-48fd-b597-1dad9aab9a5b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"288a4f36-77af-4e62-8b8d-d35231b67e4c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"15d16981-0dc6-475e-b240-1178157e346d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d064700c-840a-4e67-b603-45a38efae4e1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity","Overview":"The Story is split into two halves, the Heroes Story (Team Sonic), and Babylon Story (Babylon Rogues).

After he finds the amulet, it is revealed that Splinter was telling the story of how they stopped the four Stone Generals, and asks Donatello and Michelangelo to continue it. Once, Raph infiltrated Max Winters' tower (as Nightwatcher), and eavesdropped on a conversation with Winters and Karai. Raph was then defeated by one of the Stone Generals. Later on, Leo found out that Raph was the Nightwatcher, and a chase ensued, ending up with Leo being ambushed and captured by the Foot. Raph, feeling guilty, decides to go after the Foot. He then encounters one of the Stone Generals, and defeats her, with the help of Don and Mikey. The turtles then head off to rescue Leo, and they achieve this goal, right before the temple self-destructs. The turtles then go to Max Winter's tower, and Winters tells his story of being an immortal warrior named Yaotl. Yaotl was planning to activate a portal to another world, but it released 13 monsters into the earth. Yaotl became immortal, but it also turned his generals to stone. Yaotl then planned to stop his mistakes and his immortality by waiting for the portal to come again, and send all the monsters back to whence they came.

He gains help from New Goblin as he combats the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, and Venom. All six characters suddenly find themselves targeted by an enemy force and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in the Earth's atmosphere and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends Spider-Man to retrieve the shards of meteors. Spider-Man quickly finds that the villains who attacked him and several more of his foes, including Rhino and Scorpion, have been placed under mind control of a mysterious villain. The villain also creates and controls holographic\/symbiote combination foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s (short for Perpetual Holographic Avatar Nano-Tech Offensive Monsters). As Spider-Man fights his enemies one-by-one and rescues them from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use his army to take over the world, using each shard of the meteor to make them stronger. Spider-Man decides to temporarily don the Black Suit for the final battle.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"5025":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"THQ","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fa60f830-9859-488e-80c1-96cdcbd97602.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3a2e400e-9aad-4f9f-8e3d-6ed04a3aa36f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"212adc46-aad1-4681-b713-c1a9eba88fcd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ce33275d-c46e-4933-a054-d4a9e0ede2db.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"aa9d8cf4-4316-4bb6-b69d-7a0d6723c029.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"387aa75e-abda-44b8-9144-7a802d51c286.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8ded179a-0d18-4b1d-badb-866fd281d2b1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d384b490-2595-4f0b-9ec4-4dce08e28a0c.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5865af0c-9ec1-4bf0-843b-eb8225d2a78d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1822d489-a111-40d8-95e4-7e389384b792.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7826968f-e2d0-4e4a-bdc6-ce2103bcfc30.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a2d89558-ca52-4310-8ebe-c609a4f6790c.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f75a6de0-8fa4-4db9-adec-9ad8c28e2d01.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0cbb3342-ac2f-4740-b580-f8c4d15d9c4b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Ratatouille","Overview":"Remy is a rat who dreams of becoming a becoming a cook like his hero, the famous French chef Gusteau.

Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes.[2][3] For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and pushing the controller's strum bar; for drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. For songs with multi-part vocals, players need only to stay in tone with the lead singer to score points and keep their performance meter up, but players earn additional scoring bonuses when they successfully complete phrases in harmony.","Publisher":"MTV Games","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"5334":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Treyarch","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"588860b3-ac51-407a-bd75-6104961e7cc3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"e2d15b72-6640-49a2-9daf-6ac63cf82afa.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4882c430-264e-4bb3-83b3-40d29da16a7c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0f58358c-ff43-4974-a01d-1a490f67ad31.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"69afbf6b-0b6a-43b8-bbda-b4d5de5cac33.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cc993923-5925-4fcb-8e79-b404a8cdfefb.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6bd90b3-748b-4876-9fe0-9f4f21511e13.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"460e9e6d-8a58-490e-b381-a38a467b8af7.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"936d889e-f3ec-40bd-889e-71d64d77730e.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3572a612-cb01-455e-9e4a-30485a3ebf1c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7e16be5-977e-42a6-9c49-e50aa5adb86c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fcf7ffeb-daf8-4b4e-8915-69eb0d006564.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44cf41f3-72e5-4659-babd-ab90980b663e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"309326ae-507c-4441-8530-0374f29693b3.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7111d2af-c2b9-4f2e-91f3-45f6e13cc576.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b38a84ad-3730-4b6b-9893-78c5debbda73.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"28ae16df-8922-4d2e-8368-8a96780638f4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dda65ac7-9965-44ab-b3a0-89846f8aeb8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition","Overview":"Modern Warfare - Reflex Edition was ported by Treyarch.

They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.\n\nThe game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.\n\nThough the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.\n\nFor multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a \"Remote Weapon System\", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"5601":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Wii Remocon Plus: Variety","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Various","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"607f7bbf-93e6-4e9d-b184-4e63b8e8ba71.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1726728f-eec6-4bd0-85c3-986899d2899f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e686c50f-4431-4e84-8de4-270930570b5b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"15fe5c8a-a579-4186-b065-0ade036ee1a0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6fb9ec3a-e9dc-47e0-83de-d32b89579cb7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d1ac811e-88ae-42db-8da3-fb8af6047ec8.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"976c2e53-3187-4dec-a62b-265f293882a0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"37154043-c74b-45e0-b29e-dc1aa400af4d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wii Play: Motion","Overview":"Wii Play: Motion is a minigame collection that features Miis as playable characters.

In this world, Shulk, a young man with mysterious origins, comes across a magical sword named Monado, that allows him to see glimpses of the future. Shulk finds himself caught in the struggle between the humans from Bionis and the machines from Mechonis. Along his quest to defeat the machines he will have to help the inhabitants of Bionis rebuild their world.\n\nXenoblade Chronicles is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Exploring the vast world takes a significant part in the gameplay. Weather and day\/night cycle influence the availability of quests and characters. In such an open world it is not uncommon to encounter creatures much stronger than what Shulk and his allies can manage. When the player dies he is teleported to the last save point with no penalty. Objectives can be completed in any order and many side quests are available. \n\nThe fighting system resembles the one from Final Fantasy XII. There is no \"battle screen\"; battles happen directly in the open field without transition. During the battle attacks are launched automatically at regular intervals. The player selects his actions via a menu. Aside from Shulk, the player can control a team of characters with various abilities. Team attacks are available to inflict extra damage. However, once the player enters a battle, characters cannot be switched, and all other allies are AI-controlled.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Q_KFemPumA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xenoblade_Chronicles"},"6941":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"FIFA 12"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA Canada","ESRB":"EC - Early Childhood","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2df94cc7-8637-45e5-b3c3-692e747c0444.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7a23ac55-c2df-46cf-94c2-9a3c23df2247.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f93c11a-1d0d-4690-8b9e-c43017227d10.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d893964-babd-425a-b0fe-370e77a29c4f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4fa818de-35a3-4e81-92c7-2ae431cfa0d7.png","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"FIFA Soccer 12","Overview":"FIFA 12 brings to the pitch the game-changing new Player Impact Engine, a physics engine built to deliver real-world physicality in every interaction on the pitch.\n\nRevolutionary gameplay innovations inspired by the real-world of soccer make FIFA Soccer 12 deeper and more engaging.

The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history.\n\nPlayers control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures.\n\nIn the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sOrKTo1r6mM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battalion_Wars_2"},"7589":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"6960574a-716e-4dfc-b38b-0dc4a11d6335.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8be39599-3265-4864-9ee2-20600ed606b9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3b09cf9b-5cbc-435f-bc38-d559077341f0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"918a455f-6bc8-41db-b829-4cfeba869bb4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eebdab42-cccc-4c05-a2b7-639c60214593.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0a6b7d6e-27ae-4cb0-a2dc-46c2e3f1d0e5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ead30678-1b3e-4265-bf98-74920dd6535b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"62f5fbaa-5ac9-4d64-b686-7788c38f34a3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"80e00970-e862-4b0a-aff1-51cb401f5749.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII","Overview":"You can take to the skies and reenact some of the greatest air battles of World War II in Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII.

Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to dance.

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.\n\nBetween scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.\n\nAs you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill. The Wii Remote controls a flashlight aimed in real-time. Harry's cell phone accepts calls and messages from both the real and the supernatural, and a camera function is used to uncover hidden ghosts and their messages.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2009-12-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=42FF9ismMWY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Silent_Hill:_Shattered_Memories"},"7637":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"火焰之纹章：晓之女神","Region":"China"},{"AlternateName":"Fire Emblem Akatsuki no Megami","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Intelligent Systems","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"595c7477-ae30-49d4-a371-8409b28d2804.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"79b7be20-9b99-4bbf-a30c-08862f92b279.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2022713c-6c3a-4d21-aa74-76991ec44827.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c6904383-f92f-4e3b-a36c-88012ad0b771.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cb037864-04fc-4223-892c-ce7f2acc8cdd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5431954c-0ecb-446c-afee-5ad7c83e6603.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"718b7a82-61bd-4993-87ca-28fb8e03b322.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"170a1af1-f38e-4f80-88f9-616433776c2d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"31045e9f-82e8-4720-bdee-a89887dc46f0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e1494894-a372-43d9-8754-d112d0bbce64.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d1614fd5-2330-4770-b8f3-64e554e91cdc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e1a39f92-1bd9-4de6-9f89-391529c0b751.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f41a319d-991d-4516-a618-140a7c8e2804.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dad5b348-aaf1-4e03-8bf5-a382e1390643.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"998d8a90-6528-411f-bd00-27ccdb3eab69.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"da30aa58-29f0-4a4e-88b4-4aff498a4783.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"917f007f-79a8-4002-9a6c-2c4ed1b0d2a2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn","Overview":"The sequel to 2005's Path of Radiance and the tenth game in the Fire Emblem series, Radiant Dawn takes place three years after the defeat of the Daein kingdom by Crimea.\n\nUnlike other Wii games, the main method of control is either through the classic controller or GameCube controller, since the action is wholly turn-based tactical combat, largely the same as the previous nine games.

Each team consists of a team captain (Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, and more), three sidekicks (ranging from Koopa Troopas to Hammer Bros.), and a Kremling goalkeeper.\n\nBesides the usual soccer moves like passing the ball or tackling another player, the team captains can perform Mega Strike shots which can be stopped by the opponent's keeper by pointing the Wii Remote at the ball. Throughout each game the player receives items like bananas or bombs used to hinder the opponent. There are also unique character items for each team captain. For example, Mario will temporarily grow to Super Mario to crush his opponents.\n\nThe game features various stadiums each with their own environment, and several game modes. In Domination Mode up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can battle each other in a user-defined number of rounds of a certain length. There is also a cup mode called \"Road to the Striker cup\" where the player and other teams battle each other to win one of the three cups.

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.\n\nThere are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).\n\nThe single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.\n\nToy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2008-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w0kp0L_r1l4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mario_Super_Sluggers"},"7661":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ignition Banbury","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8645e083-0266-4dde-8860-7cd81013a9f4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"85c0cebc-d7f3-4900-bec1-d16480537bb2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d2687817-2b81-4a58-8d79-e049ccb19dca.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b5f2f4d-7686-4a12-bee0-12ce13727ae9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3622b8c0-bdb1-4067-ae7c-792bc081037f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b74d3f34-9769-42e0-8b1f-602c9a91868c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2d64ab0e-aa97-4423-9fa8-b1cc605c2159.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mercury Meltdown Revolution","Overview":"Mercury Meltdown is the sequel to Archer Maclean's Mercury, a puzzle game where your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world, while hazard try to zap, attract, repulse, eat, or blow you up.\n\nMercury Meltdown features a new vibrant visual style, a lot of completely new stages, a free-look camera, ghost mercuries and replays for your best times that can be saved, and much more.

The main method of progression is by blackmailing police, the FBI or members of other families, and what the player does or says affects the outcome. While the enforcer's goal is to destroy the other families through brute force, the operator's is to blackmail the police chiefs of the five boroughs by finding enough \"dirt\" on them during missions. The player then blackmails the chiefs, enabling the bribe gauge to fill to the top for free every time the player talks to the chief, effectively allowing the player to take control of the police in that area. The police fight alongside the player's family members and can also arrest or kill rival family members. The path of the operator also grants the player additional tactical abilities that are not open to the enforcer, such as enhanced and regenerating health, the ability to call in the four-man hit squad twice as often, enhanced crew damages and health, ability to plant car bombs and make instant stealth kills, and reduced price on bribing on the police and FBI.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0AhvuSddu4k","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Godfather_(2006_video_game)"},"7732":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Shin Chuuka Taisen: Michael to Meimei no Bouken","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"UFO","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"dee7ed2b-ca2f-4dbd-b5a1-64ce374f0e10.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"be3d4844-d90b-4c08-933f-1022729b1bab.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fb9579cb-807e-470b-bffb-a546c2c6a4ee.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5e7107a3-2f98-4d91-8ac7-cbc0ea717014.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bc7de939-c1d1-45fd-ab85-17262df97d20.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"900ffcd6-b70f-4aff-9229-58343e0f8afd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"The Monkey King: The Legend Begins","Overview":"THE LEGEND BEGINS!

The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.","Publisher":"EA","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"7736":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Toys for Bob","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"12bfdbbb-98b7-4c10-bb1e-53cd008dc945.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"31d36e48-5a4e-4509-acb4-afc21032b7e8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bac6be77-48ca-4949-8d06-681965853b47.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae5649da-230f-4a3a-874a-71be7603b717.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f6ab56f6-86ff-49ff-9f35-9f94792d9562.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6f979a90-5f1f-4d45-8925-ddb8a3c174bd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e00a2bc6-317c-4c4f-b200-46e04a8fe3c7.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cabeddaf-3a60-46a2-b409-a5ec8caef2d5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9548bd80-b9bc-48ac-ba4b-950456a980d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam","Overview":"Players aim straight downhill at high speed through 7 open locations, such as Machu Picchu, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, Edinburgh, Hong Kong, and more in Tony Hawk's first extreme downhill racing game .

Their constant snoring however disturbs an old granny from a land located in the depths below, the Land of the Livid Dead. Determined to put an end to the never ending noises she sends an army of evil creatures across the land, capturing all Electoons and Nymphs that populate the world in the process. As Rayman and his friends are captured from the creatures, they must flee their prison and attempt to bring order back to the Glade of Dreams before it's too late.\n\nRayman Origins is a reboot of the Rayman franchise and a return to the series' 2D platforming roots. Its gameplay can be seen as a mixture between Mario and the first Rayman game. Many of the original game's characters and enemies make an appearance, like Livingstones, Electoons, Betilla and the Magician's hat. There are also various characters from Rayman 2 such as Globox, the Teensies and Lums.\n\nThe game's atmosphere, however, is different from the original game and has a very \"wacky\" feel instead. The main objective of each level is to rescue as many Electoons as possible similarly to the original game. There's also Lums from Rayman 2 which act as the game's currency, but each area is heavily guarded by creatures from the Land of the Livid Dead as well as many other enemies. There's also a multiplayer option with up to four players which feels very similar to that of contemporary Mario games. It is possible to play as Rayman, Globox and two Teensies.","Publisher":"Ubisoft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MvhwWXF-LfU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rayman_Origins"},"8359":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Paris","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"ae212752-0f04-456b-9c74-ce9443ecce69.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"19dc7777-308a-464e-a213-d26695fa2cbc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc292fc5-2667-4a5f-adf0-f8861221e9a8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"10e6144b-a765-4392-8688-b8baf42c3d22.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c702b8c4-33da-428b-8e61-9dc47b0d277f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6f84eaa7-afc5-4efb-a78b-8333e4d80056.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb360a00-fe97-46c0-a366-350ebcc0fa96.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c43c672-8374-4f22-93d7-5493c145e855.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf8f0569-9539-4be9-b063-7c3425a2e84b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f6059398-3023-4e58-b65d-7481119eae10.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"341afb0f-af74-4005-9268-0383af0a5e0b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"92770468-9912-4eb0-b38e-6c7e48f23f7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Just Dance","Overview":"Dance to the rhythm of your favorite beat with Just Dance, a music & rhythm video game that allows you to dance the night away with your friends and family without ever leaving the house.

But instead of featuring famous Nintendo-characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.\n\nThe core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo-boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All-Star-Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg-shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power-ups, the All-Star-Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.\n\nThe game features several different game-modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race. These goals include using one long drift to get to the finish line, roll over as many crows as possible or get to the finish line without destroying any pots and many more.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":"2010-02-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DSVXHRR4bJ0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sonic_%26_Sega_All-Stars_Racing"},"8797":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Arcade Moon","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"89bebe88-e71a-4b23-8c72-bcbf25b80380.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b4646ed7-d393-48d3-8906-d29e982063a2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"268e8228-3d6d-453a-8e33-46803e1484fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Great Party Games (DUPLICATE of Rec Room Games, please mark for deletion)","Overview":"Have fun with the family with this great compilation of 20 classic games like Foosball, Bowling, Air Hockey, Table Tennis and more.

Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting, firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more \"outdoorsy sportsman\" and camping aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles. \n\nThere are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are \"attending\" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are \"blamed\" on the character.\n\nEvents in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more \"unusual\" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called \"Bear-Hunter-Ninja\" and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players. Coins\/Emblems can be collected in many events, along with large gems for extra points.","Publisher":"Activision Value","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"8836":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fun Labs","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1bd25849-0171-488d-a3b8-1de7e0f2fb20.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f8f23a0e-58ba-40ae-bca7-ea1238de2abb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3810e7dc-5f37-4f47-8c69-85335af6fdcc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"30a153c3-8b10-41b0-a6b3-10091976090b.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c5965959-fa13-4bfd-9419-53a3cb6e8459.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"38ba93c5-ebfd-47c9-b414-daeae0882e9f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f8bf6bf6-486a-419d-beed-fb1fe633c79c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4275c055-9e32-4c3b-99be-bd4763962a1d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f41a5c29-eb50-4e82-9d47-aef8a2e9e541.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai","Overview":"Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai is a departure from typical Cabela's gaming fare in that its focus is not on hunting. Rather, Survival is designed more as an action-adventure game with Cabela's-themed hunting elements. \n\nThe story revolves around Logan James, a private pilot flying a doctor (Doctor West) though Alaska to deliver highly important cargo to an important destination--where people's lives are at stake! Unfortunately, sans flight plan and going into a storm, the plane crash lands near Katmai Mountain and forces the pilot to venture into an adventure to survive and escape the mountain alive and with their important cargo intact. Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has. \n\nThe game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform \"Focus Shots\" which slow down time and allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against.","Publisher":"Activision Value","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"8837":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"High Voltage","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a4665760-90eb-415b-9db5-a6f322af57b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5cccd001-a278-4063-8ed1-3bd32b207a01.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1190609b-d6bc-4f79-bcbe-3763541bc901.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4682a8d4-72d5-4740-9bc0-f0bc65fd2dae.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1dba481a-67c5-4751-a16e-c6eaf9816252.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"948ccc33-a018-4424-a3d8-278d4af05334.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"38a41947-03f3-4362-a45e-67ea9480f8fc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5e018063-0d5f-4350-9fae-c1dedc8a95d7.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5cd94a51-a5f9-4b05-b680-b52c8609e848.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d0d37a58-b857-4176-8d73-d9ec1a959003.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"94568d48-e023-47db-9cf5-2a83c36a2b89.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"bbc90fd0-f9c6-43d3-b0db-039286cf9f33.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f5b03f04-7287-4502-b6de-5821c2dbf80e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b9b388ab-268f-4ede-af71-1f342cf2f3d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Captain America: Super Soldier","Overview":"Captain America: Super Soldier combines a highly athletic combat system with fluid platforming and a highly tuned suite of shield attacks, as Cap explores a massive castle turned military installation.

Besides the usual movement controls the focus lies on the new, exclusive street matches with teams of five players each. Here the player can use bound to bounce the ball - similar to hall matches. This mode has a variety of settings, e.g. a wider goal or no goalkeepers. There is even a mode in which the ball directly bounces back into the field after a goal. There are also power ups, e.g. shrinking all enemy athletes or a super shot. The career mode, in which the player creates his own athlete, deals with the rise of a street soccer player.

He learns that the outlaw couple Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, beans that can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, female cat Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery; Puss has been on the run since. Humpty convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.\n\nThe trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror who guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a gosling, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.\n\nWhen Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to his old hometown where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be captured, as revenge for abandoning him on the bridge to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.\n\nWhile in prison, Puss meets Andy Beanstalk, the original Jack, from \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" (Mike Mitchell), who warns him that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back. A repentant Kitty helps Puss break out of prison and tells him she loves him. Puss tracks down Humpty, who wants the Great Terror to demolish the town. Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Great Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart. The Great Terror, a giant goose, arrives. Using the Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Great Terror out of the town, but Humpty and the Goose are knocked off the same bridge, where Puss left Humpty, with him holding onto them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, so he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty's shell cracks open to reveal he was a golden egg on the inside. The Great Terror then takes the baby Goose and Humpty back to the giant's castle.\n\nPuss' efforts to save the town make him a hero among the townspeople. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries after being crushed by the Great Terror, Humpty is shown once again in his regular egg form, wearing a golden egg suit, as he rides the Great Terror into the clouds, and Puss and Kitty finally kiss.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ibc6uS435pc"},"9029":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"THQ","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"773cfc14-eac5-4168-9f0c-25ec1a37805c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"91aba39b-63ac-4441-853f-a592e8e249e0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5954e3c6-8af4-4a3b-9ff5-60d78b7e6726.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8fe41b20-534a-4358-b4e3-21ec6c7dc879.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b357160-f048-4aac-85dd-1b75ecc91df8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"36bbd91b-766c-4a44-82a3-46887f0ab2d5.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"11228633-2ade-4ddf-a14c-30b722ca5f71.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2099302b-2f3e-4ef4-a9dc-b0dbaa0043ac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5eed74d0-1109-4c39-b563-ba2a19b55145.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"746c4a30-457e-4149-a3e8-aaac0c9c4da5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"WWE All Stars","Overview":"WWE All Stars can be seen as a successor to WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.

Career mode allows players to compete in several cups and build up a roster of vehicles, while Arcade Mode lets players immediately jump into a race with customized difficulty and race conditions.\n\nDuring races, police will attempt to block and ram racers, causing damage that will reduce the players' top speed and amount of nitro available. The game features power-up icons in the race that immediately repair vehicle damage or increase your opponents heat level. During a race, players are awarded \"style points\" based on performing powerslides and drafting, and nitro is recharged over time.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Need_for_Speed:_Nitro"},"9063":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hydravision Entertainment","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"09d78392-20e3-48d3-840b-555e943e338f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"926fd775-3ba1-43f4-97d5-76f8b0d91c40.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6b4c65dd-64fb-4de5-b849-a4e48beb6844.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0cfc5971-55ce-41aa-ab06-f7c5a64ccc6d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"69d86253-9895-4306-8631-63d026d5d5ae.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"da41b2a7-34f9-49c2-ab39-e7124ef7a739.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7138389b-013b-4a3a-a9c7-a6b976bc2600.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"021b32d5-bf1b-4e22-9f0f-232d361d30b4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb28f94d-bc68-4fa1-a71c-25bedf1c18aa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"de3f234c-c1be-4b52-b5b4-ab3d73a5e246.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3776efdb-6cac-43d7-8946-1d07aadf2aed.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f4bc68e3-ceed-4b7f-8fa2-a9a3ebb67f8b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c3e8aab9-c4ee-45c6-8e26-275c07193039.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b2974254-cbdf-43b7-b4fa-2836ec946fac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ac38d888-3e59-4a48-9fe7-c7adf2aadca4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"379bf76a-1ae3-4f5d-b27e-db1ea9be01ae.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"767fae92-2725-4b7a-b8f1-9e3a9db148a0.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Alone in the Dark","Overview":"The PS2 and Wii versions of Alone in the Dark follow the same plot as the game developed for Xbox 360 and Windows by Eden Games, but were created by a different company with their own vision how the game should be implemented.\n\nLevel structure, mechanics of gameplay, and looks of the characters (Sarah, especially) sometimes differ strongly as these versions contain concept elements that were left out of the other game.

The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare.

Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates.

You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team.","Publisher":"Ignition Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2008-03-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2GrbmRUX8pU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obscure_II"},"9071":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blue Tongue Entertainment","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9aab3431-863b-494a-ba93-bf374e836021.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a5e1fa63-4040-441c-bcd0-77c9e39c7e0b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c9dfa888-eb65-4a10-924b-7f5f4b1fd170.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"919c90f2-57ab-465b-bea1-746ab25dd02c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"320fb399-fbcd-4b37-9d8d-09e4817b7321.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6843d06f-d5f3-4c83-b0ad-ff4aa6701ad7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"28f2f25d-66a9-4990-9b64-d31555a47edb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1371d0ae-9291-47a0-a15f-58ce46f6e992.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"87f126fe-a0cc-47a1-9d5a-c2fc9a04224c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"43a482be-cf2e-4835-bb64-062fc9a1b45f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f59cbafb-a5b2-4044-b6de-5b57fd6dd571.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"dbba9e18-1026-4b29-b84d-ea723c62ae98.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"15c4ace8-87d4-43e6-bf2d-c83e5fd1dc70.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1b6822cd-e8ea-4d6c-9d54-aa0ae63d6871.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"302b8cb8-489e-4047-a59c-682bfe90c131.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b1a1b5cb-0a02-4f55-8245-763a5658cbcc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"de Blob 2","Overview":"A mysterious priest called Papa Blanc, who is actually the villain from the first game, Comrade Black, in disguise, is doing his utmost to rig the outcome of the vote by cheating with an artificial metal arm in each voting booth that presses Blanc, allowing his cult of Inkies to wreak all manner of colour-related havoc on the metropolis. The INKT Corporation. as before, manages to drain all colour from the city and also turns its inhabitants, the Raydians, into generic drones. Once again, it is up to Blob and the members of the Colour Underground to restore the city to its vibrant former glory. Blob frees the lands one by one, as he did in the last game, fighting against many foes, including a massive monster created in a factory accident, as he approaches Comrade Black.

Once De Blob frees all of Prisma City, he confronts Comrade Black again, only to discover, as he flees to space once again, that Black had used Blob's own journey against him, using color beacons that were mysteriously activated as Blob progressed to power an orbiting satellite to enslave the entire planet. As Blob gets closer and closer, Black taunts him and forces him to make a series of choices: continue on, or rescue a few Graydians that Black had placed in biodomes rigged to explode and risk running out of time.

Party","Overview":"FaceBreaker is one part Fight Night, two parts Ready 2 Rumble Boxing from the N64 era. EA has combined a simple high and low jab system with an A+Waggle special punch, as well as a tilt-based charge system for your regular jabs, turning a flick of the nunchuk or Wii-mote into a full-on power punch instead of a quick tap of the face. As you'd expect, the nunchuk controls your player's left hand, while the Wii-mote acts as his right.\n\nThe game plays exactly how it does on the other next-gen systems, having punches thrown at an alarming rate with no sense of stamina, though a smarter opponent will make use of the Z button (block) and the punch charging to catch their opponent's attack, and deliver a devastating counter-punch that leaves them out of the fight for a second or so. Other than that, it's all about beating the ever-loving hell out of your enemy, building up a small power gauge at the bottom of the screen, and holding the A button while swinging the Wii-mote to deliver different types of haymaker punches based on the level of power you've acquired. Fill the gauge all the way up, and a successful hit will result in a FaceBreaker, which is an automatic knock-out for the fight. Pretty cool.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Inc","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9214":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Square Enix","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f805ceed-eb81-4f22-ac02-1f39cf7b1648.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"071fc2b3-5c64-4153-87bd-cc80c6f6dec4.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"03ddc548-f898-4edd-8038-00194528494c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b0386fb3-2a4e-4aa3-a79b-c5cf074c074d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3023714e-a29f-4607-9313-83c9ce4a5149.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9dc817f3-5014-4959-a4b2-68433fd09a60.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time","Overview":"The idea of DS-to-Wii connectivity is something that interests me in a big, big way. Nintendo currently has the most popular console out there, but the company has also been dominating the handheld world for two decades, so it only seems natural that the two systems would converge into one superpower system, similar to how Voltron, the Power Rangers, or Constructicons form into something more amazing than the sum of their parts. Pretty much every piece of cool tech out there does it, so it's high time Nintendo does too. Right?\nUnfortunately, there hasn't been too hot of a track record, as GameCube's connectivity started and ended with Zelda and the original Crystal Chronicles, and now Wii's offering is less than stellar. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time is a great DS game on its own, but it's entirely a cop-out Wii package, and one that not only drops the ball on its own, but is also far from an ideal multiplayer offering from handheld to console. Looking for a great DS dungeon crawler? You've found it. Want to skip on the handheld and grab it on Wii? You'd be better off waiting for the real Crystal Chronicles later down the line.\nIt isn't often I get to review DS and Wii games in tandem, but this is certainly a case where it's vital to do so, and the DS version destroys Nintendo's home console offering. Quite simply, Echoes of Time is 100% a DS port. After an oddly long load process, the Wii version of Crystal Chronicles runs a fully emulated version of the DS game, including everything from legal screens to the system's dual screen setup. The only difference for Wii cosmetically is that the + and – keys on the Wii-mote will resize the two screens on the fly. Wii IR is available for clicking on icons and entering text on the right (bottom) screen just as the stylus does on DS, but outside of that, it's the same game. Identical visuals, identical story, identical tech.","Publisher":"Square Enix","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9215":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"6d0823ec-a0cf-4c53-a6c3-6f7a9cf1adb5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"491fb034-76a0-466c-9669-ab8e5400e7cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c92a7574-d45a-4ab5-a3ba-abe4302a65af.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"250e3c50-37d1-4a5e-a397-aca196a3b795.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7785a2d8-b220-42ff-9067-f5ffdf2706d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5","Overview":"For me, Hot Wheels topped out when they released the ones that you could ram into each other and the hoods would flip to look like they had been in a real fender bender.

Known in Japan as Itadaki Street, Fortune Street marks the first time this franchise (which has been around for more than two decades) will be released in the States.\nCreated by Yuji Horii, the man behind Dragon Quest, the game has players rolling dice and moving around oddly-shaped boards. Much like Monopoly, you use your starting wealth of cash to purchase unoccupied property you land on, which you can expand the value of by investing in (you can do this when you land on one of your own lots or on the bank square). Buy more than one piece of property in the same district and the value of your assets rises. If someone lands on one of your lots they have to pay you rent that turn. Your property becomes your primary source of income and power as the game progresses, so it's extremely important to invest wisely. The ultimate goal is to make as much bank as possible and force your opponents into bankruptcy.","ReleaseDate":"2012-01-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9218":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eighting","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"0c55738f-b072-4bdb-ac4c-3a493f527011.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"05d9bacf-ecdc-4388-8308-cff91b02f58f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bf26f6b1-575e-4d31-b2f0-a7a0f951eb18.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f4f4492-0395-44ae-aa90-3356fd81df7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"45ff9c28-d9d9-4cb3-ba9b-cd51f0e5de66.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"451e768b-97e4-4070-83cd-c6e93d5dfbbf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"a1912c4f-d5b0-46ab-a7e9-6adbb4873690.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"66f22987-8e1f-4ae8-9cb6-cc27fc2b9394.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution III","Overview":"Clash of Ninja Revolution 3, developed by the same studio working on the anticipated Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, is an easy-to-learn, traditional fighter that takes place during the Naruto Shippuden timeline.

It's a pretty simple concept overall, and with each child's five main levels you'll get a different piece of the story leading up to the same grand finale. Once they arrive in the land of dreams, each character meets up with a Nights almost instantaneously, and from there learns to meld with the mysterious creature and fly through the world of Nightopia.

In this game, the minigames don't appear after everyone moves, but only when a player ends up on any of the spaces that triggers a minigame.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2012-03-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"9356":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Namco Tales Studio","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"e22741ee-85af-4c8f-a192-5d804ca78628.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5fa1eb09-abd5-45ca-bfa6-aee13e451ab0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"99585bad-e140-4f2b-aa5b-e09dd3fe5c0c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"47110f3d-ad25-418e-96ad-53fb8b68daa6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7a250e9-9076-46d1-aa47-eccbaca41cf0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b371fc06-516d-41e2-90b7-050b678bf025.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f3d68b75-e5fd-4c4b-beaf-48568c0d6c30.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"aa06008c-97a4-4d7a-ba44-09e96e3b7690.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"62fc2923-5ded-4554-b995-ce83c7d95640.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"33b338df-ccad-4c58-8a19-adc0fd6d0a23.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World","Overview":"A beloved classic returns!

Despite the debilitated state of the mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line of defense stands proud and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island, ruled by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons that magically –and mysteriously-- concentrates beasts into a single region, his island has become a small wonder for its powers.\n\nAmong those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who at an early age was orphaned when his homeland became one of the many victims of battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries often face disdain and fear as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the tasks put before them by the Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most honorable status that they have only dreamed of - knighthood.\n\nIt is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a hidden site, one which grants him a wondrous and yet familiar power to gather his enemies in one place…","Publisher":"Xseed Games","ReleaseDate":"2012-08-14T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m0UNe8bNfEo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Last_Story"},"9522":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ata Design Interactive","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"29d4d7a6-3a50-4817-be6d-14d63534c6cc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fb3bf925-893b-40eb-8599-106135545e89.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d629b221-921e-40fc-b5bd-3347a0c8cce0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bc96b09c-7d9d-4c92-b4b4-ba1e9acf009d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fad8efea-0e6e-4173-b14b-98755504594f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9ee2b79a-d0a4-4f11-b4c3-6927dff01acd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7687e769-19ef-4c58-bdce-9e21be3d8c77.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e8233e23-e16d-416c-86a2-15fc5c4681df.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6c52519d-027f-42eb-8fba-5e7b93560ccd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fe5ef964-665b-4070-8604-c93fb5de19b9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0351a1be-71c7-4660-9892-d9b4f5c6e8f9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a27ad87b-d201-449c-8069-de66b083c703.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"26592fc7-7ae2-4236-9f96-652b43e42bd4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Crazy Mini Golf 2","Overview":"It's time to get into the mini swing of things with Crazy Mini Golf 2!

Whitney subsequently receives news that Smythe has escaped police custody, but Gwen convinces Peter to deal with it later.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2012-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(2012_video_game)"},"10911":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visual Concepts","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"9d2267c3-2364-45b6-afc6-1ded369d46ef.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"e68e5ff3-d845-4b6b-a374-5e5ff02cd9bd.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b3982556-d407-461a-9c65-86669c7a275c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cc2d094b-52c6-4b9a-aca4-7eb48e3b6410.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"99668124-d745-4dd7-873d-b799db6493b6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"84ab1f29-1ee8-4606-8a0b-a8d5d1e07658.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4f5f6dd3-e147-4bf8-8ab4-acf8c80b5ffe.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8e7a71f1-b713-4d5f-9a8f-68e7f2c1dcb7.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"06b9d1f6-f5ce-4282-a070-1d6a99933e54.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Major League Baseball 2K12","Overview":"The path to glory is yours to choose in MLB 2K12!

The Predator Technology 2.0 game engine has been updated from the previous WWE games to allow for more fluid animations, with odd collisions and transitions having been fixed and updated, it also allows for over 300 new moves. Past problems have been fixed with a better weight detection system, contextual animations and automatic attack homing, to ensure that the character always strikes towards the enemy. The contextual animation system has been refined to ensure that it dynamically swaps out moves to make sure that the game is using the appropriate move animations at any given time and state. The weight detection system makes it so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show. Thus, the contextual animations ensure that more appropriate attacks are put in the superstar's normal moveset. The game's new homing system is designed that when doing high flying moves, a player will hit the intended target with better precision. The homing system also tracks tables so that they will be better detected when doing grapples on a ladder in TLC and Ladder matches.[4]\n\nThe game is the first to feature Spectacular Moments, also known as \"OMG! Moments.\" This feature allows players to bug the game to make it seem as ring breaks, barricade breaks, announce table breaks, and catching (mid-air) finishers are possible.[5] The Predator Technology engine has been further updated to include an enhanced audio engine, dubbed WWE Live. Instead of chanting pre-recorded in a warehouse as done in previous WWE games, WWE Live features chanting recorded from live WWE events. To make the audio more authentic, WWE Live features more crowd participation, with the crowd's chants, cheering and booing being dependent on the situation occurring in the match. Sounds were recorded by the WWE Production team and THQ from actual live events. Divas matches have also been updated, with up to six Divas, created and original, being able to compete simultaneously in the ring, a feature absent for many years. WWE '13 will also feature WWE Universe 3.0, which was also further updated to allow the player to edit schedules, television shows, rosters, as well as creating alliances or feuds between several wrestlers.\n\nOn September 21, it was confirmed that WWE '13 would contain the I Quit Match for the first time since WWF SmackDown! and the King of The Ring Tournament.[6]","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2012-10-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=arQMM5iyT_o"},"11649":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubisoft Milan","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"ab0fd367-1b44-4cae-9e79-8a994034dbdc.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"ae53143d-39a0-4efc-a0f8-cd979ac25b03.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a01810f6-8150-4277-94d1-7e3c963849e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1dca3ce0-9437-4ba3-bb10-80f0550e2620.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c2a7b614-9fb2-4f01-89b2-ac9139b3a9ce.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6d0c5584-d72e-479c-abd0-cea8df756820.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Just Dance 4","Overview":"Just Dance 4 features more than 40 new tracks, ranging from chart-topping Billboard hits to classic dance party tracks.

An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player's destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome. The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. For example, the hero's ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.","Publisher":"NIS","ReleaseDate":"2010-03-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q-BOo1u86G4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sakura_Wars:_So_Long,_My_Love"},"11764":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Atlus","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Life Simulation; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"ae58a539-53bd-4c72-8e37-e866821e1524.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bebd52e9-06e4-42ef-abb7-db496930ebd7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"559b6ee1-d681-4a44-9dc1-a77771b5324b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4b3446f1-7b47-442b-9e63-7e796cd4d058.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"435395e9-9bf9-4da7-9c4b-72b3823b95d7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b7d45f40-c548-41ef-b8b0-cfc03dd01bfc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b622878-143b-4587-8aca-780738401932.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ff731e0b-973d-43ba-a06d-aeb0e4067079.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cdb09be2-3920-495b-9fe7-3119e0492ad6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e85d4134-e4e2-4c7f-b388-69868441c99d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e99f3447-c6aa-4a10-8415-44448126cfd2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d5d73f46-a83a-4094-b865-ca0da9980434.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"58776294-7d0c-4c0c-854c-8b16ec08a753.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Trauma Center: New Blood","Overview":"Keep your hands steady and your mind focused for Trauma Center: New Blood, sequel to Trauma Center: Second Opinion.

Prior to the first workout, a player must complete a fitness assessment—the player is asked to record their resting heart rate, then, following 2 minutes of jumping jacks, is asked to record their heart rate again. This data is used to approximate the relative intensity of the physical activity of completing that set of jumping jacks. This is then used to determine what types of exercises Maya will ask the player to complete during her exercise routine. The fitness assessment also records the player's self-reported weight and evaluates strength and flexibility.\n\nCore strength is measured by the amount of sit-ups (a maximum of 40) the player can complete; lower-body strength is measured by the number of squats (a maximum of 60) the player can complete, and upper strength is measured by the number of push-ups (a maximum of 40) the player can complete. Flexibility is measured on a 1-7 scale by how far the player can reach forward when seated with the legs stretched out in front with feet flexed. On every 10th workout, the player will repeat this fitness evaluation as a Physical Challenge. This results in a dynamic workout program that changes with the player's physical fitness level and ability. Based on the results of each Physical Challenge, Maya will suggest one of 5 areas a player can choose to emphasize in—Weight Loss, Cardio, Upper Strength, Core Strength, and Lower Strength. In addition to this, Maya will also suggest an emphasis for each workout a player initiates. In addition to these workout options, the player can choose to do Yoga by selecting the Meditation Garden.\n\nOnce a workout is selected, the player can choose the duration of her workout—15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or 60 minutes. The duration is a rough estimate, with the workouts often being a few minutes longer due to additional time spent warming up and stretching. The player can then choose a virtual environment to work out in as well as what genre of background music to listen to—only a few environments and music genres are available at first, but, as the player keeps consistent with her schedule, more are unlocked.\n\nThe game includes over 500 types of exercises, although some exercises with variable repetitions are counted as separate in this tally. Furthermore, if the player owns an exercise ball, hand weights, an exercise step, or a heart rate monitor, Maya can incorporate these into the program. At certain sections of the routine, Maya will stop to ask how the player is doing; the player's selection of one of three replies will affect whether the program strengthens, weakens, or leaves the current regimen as it is.","Publisher":"Ubisoft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2008-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iDYwPNwWtLs"},"13401":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Traveller's Tales","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f0b97a3f-114e-42f0-8593-51cb97cf2f98.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a2d58b55-5ee3-472e-b51f-f7b0b3217c69.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f9fab120-7ecb-4815-b97b-65d9ed3fc32c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d5a93ab3-1078-4a88-b485-f5cd6c695536.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d006d4a7-1fe7-45a0-9418-8e260aeb127d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3e53d907-f7c4-42ac-9c32-a6288789a9d8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b2876c08-9628-40bf-9026-5e08071cc07b.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian","Overview":"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is an action-adventure fantasy video game developed by Traveller's Tales to coincide with the theatrical release of the film of the same name.

Legend tells of how the Spirit King, whose coming was heralded in by a meteor shower, gained control of the creatures and waged an unrelenting war upon civilization. Order and life were brought to the brink of destruction, but an alliance of the four races was able to drive them back and seal the evil. Centuries more have passed and once again the lands are slowly being overrun by the reemerging monsters. Without a known cause or even a united front to repel them, it would seem that this time, Eldar will fall. It is up to the main character to take up the forgotten mantle of the hero, reunite the races, and confront the hordes of monsters.","Publisher":"Xseed Games","ReleaseDate":"2009-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5NymJPb2tps","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Valhalla_Knights:_Eldar_Saga"},"13987":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Onechanbara Revolution","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tamsoft","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b0730666-032f-4aa8-9e9a-facd2c802d13.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"351c4570-7e19-4b6a-809c-b375eec31469.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f0e292ff-6254-4930-9c4a-8217304c5094.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cbefbba7-3cf5-421b-b65d-e0343f25d518.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"31e6d9c2-216f-4c4f-a69b-e68bf8015e0a.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ef3ab16c-3d45-4597-915e-1595abef7e78.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2174a536-da91-49fb-a70e-4c2ed788ccd8.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"656170c0-f981-4dbc-b61b-e4e8a729b1b7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"960bb404-fb2b-4460-810f-9b15a2c39af7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"38b52e6a-bb83-4638-9822-345827c7e766.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"860ded90-f04f-4f18-928a-a79e3949ce2c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0eb3822e-da29-4337-bd0a-fbe9d64de608.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"98f524f2-9905-460e-bae7-5a31ce8135c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"897bca98-5257-4c19-8147-77f3dbba0f1e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Onechanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers","Overview":"Zombie carnage and armed babes with tight outfits ... that's Onechanbara in a nutshell, and the blood-spurting, short skirting action series comes to the Wii in all of its visceral glory.

As with the previous games in the series, the game is based around precise timing and listening, rather than watching for visual cues. A player should ideally be able to play the game solely based on the audio cues given within each level's song.\n\nUnlike the stylus-based inputs of Rhythm Heaven, Rhythm Heaven Fever returns to the more precise button taps that the original Rhythm Tengoku used. The A and the B Buttons are the only inputs used for each level (usually only the A Button), and players must carefully time their presses to progress through each level. As with the previous games, you're given a rank at the end of each level, based on how good your timing was, either \"Fail\", \"Pass\" or \"Excellent\". If you earn an \"Excellent\" rank on the level, it becomes available for the \"Perfect\" challenge, which appears randomly. In the \"Perfect\" challenge, you have three attempts to complete the level without missing a single beat. Successfully earning \"Perfect\" unlocks special rewards.\n\nRhythm Heaven Fever uses a simplistic, but creative visual style, with each level being quite unique from the other. One moment you could be high-fiving monkeys in a gigantic pocket watch, the next you could be playing badminton with a dog and a cat flying in planes through a cloudy sky.","Publisher":"Nintendo of America Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2012-02-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zjX0k_UFdlM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rhythm_Heaven_Fever"},"14050":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Guinness World Records: Das Videospiel","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"TT Fusion Ltd.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"eec5126b-87e5-4e36-b9d9-2a3fd14ebeb9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5ed64fa9-6289-40d8-befb-52c1e6dfd175.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"228a71d8-30dd-4385-b4fc-4a3a52220b4b.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3cb62840-9f41-45b5-91e9-1a946d4bc2b5.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1a01ddc9-0725-47fd-843a-2d6e4a89667d.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"781495b8-c0ea-46d9-b5dd-da5bb1d38120.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7eb8bf4-415a-43d1-a39d-9f095218f028.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ec30f4bf-7eef-425a-af5b-31eb4c4b62f6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5aa2bd4d-e7d7-49d9-95fb-ecf9ee6bcbf6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7fc2d52f-10d3-438d-b271-9e176ed5f8cf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a4955d69-40e5-4fef-8e33-8ccd1326cd79.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c5a77276-3932-4c15-93bd-6531cc39de6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Guinness World Records: The Videogame","Overview":"Break records in your living room in a variety of stunts inspired by actual records found in the book.

When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first “Haunted House Simulator” where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened.","Publisher":"Xseed Games","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ju-On:_The_Grudge_(video_game)"},"14519":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Infinity Ward","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e9187574-9cc1-4161-bfc7-b23753f2b30a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6d2ab32f-a5ae-4d99-9efb-b93dadc01568.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bbf88e53-8905-4980-a495-279f52a60049.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d366f391-6c16-47c7-ad3d-cf6bc4899971.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3f9c53c5-6b41-4844-ba6b-4e4cf7b227d5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b0d335a8-f063-4236-817c-51e6e12c90c1.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f721ee0c-800b-492c-a65d-a3985fe89e23.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"52b9eb60-a8e1-4d57-b3db-3bf7081d38a0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d819fd24-b4fd-410c-afde-17cd3d6aaa99.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b020a392-6267-4918-94b0-a7db892da80d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8a4d1b64-8314-4859-a0b3-ee284b12ed90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":16,"Name":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3","Overview":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (stylized as Call of Duty: MW3) is a 2011 first-person shooter video game, developed by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games (Treyarch for the Wii version), with development assistance from Raven Software, and published by Activision.

The reviewers criticized the lack of former Van Halen members, Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony and Gary Cherone, the limited tracks selected from Van Halen's discography, the selection of other tracks included in the game, and the general lack of features introduced in the previous band-centric games and Guitar Hero 5.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"2009-12-22T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"14653":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Smack Down","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"dcb511cf-a3b9-4de9-84c4-d1d0d2f7d33a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1ee1bf67-53ec-4214-b24f-bc0c634a6f31.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2254dcdf-3c7d-4814-af18-b75fab1ac2b5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5e204ef2-1e33-469e-a557-5600a88c81c9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"81f945cb-dcf5-4db7-9793-e0ddfa6ac7d9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"17ab21bf-21fe-42f8-979d-5b6efdd33353.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Minute to Win It","Overview":"In Minute to Win It you will have to tackle unique challenges as you compete to win 1 million dollars in NBC's hit game show.

Depending on the difficulty level, different collectibles are available in each level. On all difficulty settings, players must collect the Yellow Crystals to complete the level. In Easy and Normal Mode, players must also collect the Stump Temple Pieces in order to unlock the game's final level. Also in Normal Mode, players can collect Green Emeralds which will unlock secrets, such as new marbles or Junk for use in creation of new level editor parts. In the highest difficulty setting, players must retrieve the Colony's missing ants from each level. In addition to the collectibles, players may be awarded with bronze, silver, gold, or platinum trophies for completing levels within a predetermined amount of time. Obtaining these trophies will also unlock new balls.\n\nThe game features 7 different worlds with a variety of gadgets to help players through their journey. The game features 150+ levels with a variety of collectibles available in each mode including, Yellow Crystals, Green Emeralds, Stump Temple Pieces, and eventually ants from Anthony's colony.

It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and sound effect generators, and features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.\n\nTo score points, the player must press buttons to activate accented beats, adjust their crossfade between the two songs, and \"scratch\" the turntable on the game's custom controller in time to marks that scroll on the screen to score points and perform well for the virtual crowd. The game features both a single player Career mode and cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also features a mode for selected songs for a DJ player to play alongside another player using a Guitar Hero guitar controller. Many DJ and mix artists have contributed to the game both in the game's development, the creation of mixes, and in lending their images for playable avatars in the game; these including DJ Shadow, Z-Trip, DJ AM, Grandmaster Flash, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Daft Punk.\n\nDJ Hero was generally well received by game journalists, praising the departure from the Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, the use of the turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uA0kSEdBygY"},"15453":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"aad55aec-ed28-4a64-8c26-1309e9fd53f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"aed45544-3e95-4b7a-a094-75b221d1e771.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"62e09de9-ed5b-4a68-a51f-8e3fb6a47996.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0fd68b82-94cc-44c1-aece-d691fdfd8a2b.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c6ce17f5-37ea-46be-aa61-cd020156b77f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"51cfc6e9-21d1-4b0d-bcc5-7f347b7cf998.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0cdf4131-aaeb-4123-8eb8-246f22034e84.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0c1ec13b-0973-47ef-8a05-537dfe57abe4.png","Type":"Disc"}],"Name":"DreamWorks Super Star Kartz","Overview":"In the game, players race as their favorite DreamWorks Animation characters as they speed, jump, power-up and boost through wacky, wild and wondrous kart courses and compete to be the first to cross the finish line.

The Original Concept for Karaoke Revolution was created by Scott Hawkins and Sneaky Rabbit Studios.[1] Technology and concepts from the game were subsequently incorporated into Harmonix's game Rock Band.\n\nThe Japanese versions of the game are developed by Konami themselves. The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments.\n\nThe game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song.\n\nThe songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled Karaoke Revolution, just like the original) features all master tracks.[2]","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"15757":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ga'Hoole: La Legenda de los Guardianes","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tantatus","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"78c37242-5e62-4c7c-b818-b97ebdf8a257.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"103ad024-e47c-4ebc-8c64-d5100ddffd7f.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"78c2a5a8-6d3f-42aa-a677-b59bcbdd9c57.png","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"61bd1775-05a5-46ae-bb23-7f1507967182.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"db5433f6-66ae-4a83-ba12-97c6b8adaf0c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2fd5a738-6bcb-46c3-a388-258217a16bc2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d874ddf6-c1d1-4720-ae3e-14152ad705eb.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2b0602c-8b76-4f65-946c-3dab7b996bb4.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d29abecf-0cee-425e-a3ad-5c6be7678118.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2061bc1f-12e3-4ab2-a744-e73d2acc955d.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7f6263aa-3856-4ec6-94a8-0e88b6b78c07.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"00b84123-ee0d-4095-9bcd-a492bc6e4969.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1b425e89-b504-4fa6-8c44-d61a34a5a99a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"41bae943-12f1-4b01-9301-65d9d027b88c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"293af51a-c4e8-4d82-8ad7-8b1287d938c9.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0c170c94-e3e6-4a37-8242-ee6dd5596b30.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a8026c85-e62a-44ad-9967-962abefb0c13.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4ad5d50e-dac8-43b4-b086-a7e5b3cd792e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole","Overview":"The story of the game follows the tale of Shard and his friends.

However, during the watch of a young guard named Grettir, the Monastery was attacked by Hagsfiends. After losing most of what he knew as his family, he was plagued of guilt and many others who had heard the story branded him a traitor and a coward. After many years of isolation, Grettir took a mate named Lygeia and had an egg together. On the night that the owlet was to hatch, the nest of Grettir was attacked by owls and they killed the Grettir and his mate, but the owlet, now named Shard, survived.","Publisher":"Warner Bros.

Once again, a system-exclusive, motion-sensitive control system simulates the real-life actions of pitching the ball and swinging the bat. Built on the same engine as the previous year's game, the 2K10 edition of the MLB game boasts improvements in accuracy and offers new features to give players more control while pitching and hitting. The \"Total Hitting Control\" system allows players on offence to swing for the fences, aim for a well-placed fair ball, or foul out of play, to work against the pitcher's stamina in a full-count battle. The \"Batter's Eye\" feature occasionally gives players a momentary preview of a pitch will cross the plate, depending in part on the skill and accuracy of the athlete at bat.","Publisher":"2K Sports","ReleaseDate":"2010-03-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WU-dn147qG8"},"15860":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1d0fd139-4a16-4465-88f7-51c10076621e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9faa7b43-bfea-45fb-866e-2bf38b05392b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8fea9ce2-d294-4edc-bf42-aa7b98805f8d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9211c95d-8130-4949-b9cd-ed0ea2c64873.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2f6efb12-47b2-41fc-87e0-98761e7835dc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3c59f549-a3c2-42eb-9f2e-4cc8fa783055.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Major League Baseball 2K9","Overview":"Major League Baseball 2K9 or, in short, MLB 2K9, is an MLB-licensed baseball simulation video game published by 2K Sports.

The game is built on the same engine that many of the previous 2K hockey games used, and features include Season, Franchise, 2-on-2 Mini Rink, 4-on-4 Pond Hockey, and Shootout modes. Season Mode allows you to take basic control over an NHL team and guide them through an entire 82-game schedule, as well as (if you're good enough) the playoffs. Franchise is like Season Mode, but much deeper. In it, you guide a team through multiple seasons of hockey, and have control of options like drafting, contract signings, free agency, and hiring staff. The 2-on-2 and 4-on4 modes allow you and a friend to hand-pick a team of players (3 or 5, depending on the mode) and face off in a wide-open, arcade-style hockey game. Shootout works exactly like a shootout in real hockey: three skaters per side alternate taking shots at the goaltender, and most goals wins. Aside from game play modes, you also have the option of creating your own player or your own team from scratch, as well as modifying the existing roster (ie make trades, edit line combination) to your taste.\n\nNHL 2K9 is the first NHL Sports title for the Nintendo Wii. The Wii version features motion controls for shooting, passing, checking, and even fighting. There's also a new system for those who like to take control of the goaltender, which involves mimicking controller movements as they flash up on the screen in order to make saves.\n\nThe PS3 and XBOX 360 version include online play, in which you can jump into a quick game with up to 11 other players, or participate in online leagues or tournaments.\n\nIn the broadcast booth, Bob Cole and Harry Neal have been replaced by the San Jose Sharks' announcing team of Randy Hann and Drew Remenda. The game soundtrack mainly comprised of energetic rock tunes, and features the likes of The Offspring, Bad Religion, and Mastodon.","Publisher":"AK Tronic Software & Services GmBh","ReleaseDate":"2008-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16052":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Images":[{"FileName":"d60b7679-b2cb-4ab2-93a3-3f753db394f2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"ec8919db-f67b-4961-afd8-33ba7554bba3.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9986017d-254f-4540-9565-5fde749f45fb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"02a5614a-bd7a-47ba-bf02-2ab347445ce9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4418f1d6-072e-4f5d-a8df-6c2a63023037.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8e73405a-8d07-4a69-a212-a91ace95fd18.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b1c9691-cd41-43bc-8088-9bf65ce845ac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1aa66adc-e6e2-4494-a5b4-36b372d391a8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2bbb5444-680c-4b2d-acba-8914f4815dd1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c560cc8a-a4a3-4797-b159-a0d4858088a8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5856e1fe-365b-4bcf-8f7d-ebe069c7a5b9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"567144f5-50df-451e-b71b-50c907f54ae0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"NHL 2K10","Overview":"NHL 2K10 is an ice hockey simulation developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports, part of the NHL 2K series.

In addition to new slogans, the number of names has also been increased and the characters are provided with voice animations for the first time.\n\nThe PEGI gave the game an age rating of 3 years.","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"16454":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Score International Baja 1000: World Championship Offroad Racing","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Left Field Productions, Inc.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ea98ded5-5c70-402b-b3a5-2b178cfd476d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"47a5de2f-51f6-4dbd-afdf-a05de4657628.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"bb459664-68c7-4e98-a093-f4186e025071.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ee6ef7f3-d381-4c2d-9f9a-042aba277485.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2080dc2-2fde-490d-af5d-65cfc24d0341.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6ac0389c-203f-4bd4-93d3-9e7627cf401e.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8d3022bc-1ca6-4969-8be8-862f84e8cfeb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d985fc54-b12b-4c1c-93ca-f8601446be28.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc199b63-b7ce-4136-b645-3f350d64e92a.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a825ee6-7b37-44c4-a47c-838b34ef905c.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e75d6ede-2eba-4d0c-961e-8da683a969aa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5ff15244-7a10-4539-bf78-4d4a52082a0a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2aa25b4a-b3bb-4e24-a852-cd06874afd2c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6cae2190-4ffd-46f4-8e83-86daf4245c2d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f7aa48cd-44b0-40ff-a18b-c00f692617fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"72343129-9744-4d43-ba64-a28758008c9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"74139e4a-d12a-421b-8c1f-0166403d429d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"60c5630b-3f57-4386-a947-64a9f6a385db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"SCORE International Baja 1000","Overview":"Drive the most powerful off-road vehicles in this hair-raising quest for sand supremacy!

In an act of desperation, the high wizard Zale sundered the land and created a rift around Celenheim, keeping the armies of Vatar at bay. In time, Celenheim forgot the war and forgot Vatar as they went about their daily affairs. Now, the rift is closing, and evil threatens the land once again. An unlikely hero, freed from prison by happenstance, must rise and fight for Light or Darkness, to either destroy the demon king Vatar or kill the queen of Celenheim.\n\nThe end seemed inescapable... Vatar - the Prince of Darkness had won. But a lonely Mage stands high up on a mountain ridge, defying the Demon. He lifts his staff high in the air then thumps it down on the earth – and unimaginably powerful spells are created, harnessing the infernal powers of nature. The rift caused by the Mage's powerful spell continues to expand, sucking everything into a seemingly endless abyss.\n\nOn the one side an Enclave of Light was created, which they called Celenheim. On the other side of the gigantic ravine, dark and evil life forms were fighting to survive in the Outlands.However, the centuries passed and now the ravine has become narrower. Attacks from the shadow world have grown in number and intensity. In these difficult times, vital decisions must be made, and it's all up to the player!","Publisher":"TopWare Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2012-05-22T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enclave_(video_game)"},"18050":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Arcade Hits Pack: Gunblade NY & LA Machineguns","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Sega","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"20db7f25-1a0c-4240-bbf1-0c35fbc9781f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"70bee3d4-bcc0-4efe-9cd7-1c9ccd30f484.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a65f37b-afbd-425f-b9c0-1e7e300825c6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6dc46cf3-0d56-41af-8ef5-6c1b6ba0a7f9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d5835feb-6821-4d40-a303-9562bcd5d194.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"50664c0e-1a19-4ced-b771-a2a02c2e0a11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Gunblade NY & LA Machineguns: Arcade Hits Pack","Overview":"Two fast-paced and beloved arcade shooter games take you to the skies above some of America's most well-known locales.

The first game starts off with Rayman being kidnapped while at a picnic and Rabbids have him endure many types of tests that the player must complete in order for him to be set free. The next game features Rayman entering a mall trying to attack the angry Rabbids that have captured him in the previous game. In TV Party, he is running away from the Rabbids and discovers that a bolt of lightning has transferred the Rabbids into a TV set, which is the premise for the mini games.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2010-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18073":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"2b4af71a-853e-496f-80b0-c2825618e6c7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a2316fdb-a5e2-43fa-97d4-e08b15c0d91a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d1d29017-d6a8-42e4-85e2-8c85b4ce86a6.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ef348025-bcb5-420e-9c34-99382ebe21ff.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"14692b5e-edb6-46e4-8541-34a7c08d8aee.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6f76c887-89ac-4633-8f9f-c1c65af2b7de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"501b36a8-0b3d-4cab-9442-e81193649fd7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35c8584d-ffaa-4c23-ad79-2a8891bfb139.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10460b76-7f0b-45ea-ab48-eb4b0f3b5395.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"852628e1-07ce-4b9c-8172-ca08cd49e82d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"46cf4f5b-2626-4fc7-b243-db55edb7f43c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"82b2e7a1-0eff-4451-8bc0-0c0f154faecb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wii Chess","Overview":"You can now test your Chess skills against the Wii, with the latest Touch Generations title from Wii.

Characters, play-sets and other features are brought into the game using figurines and discs with the included Infinity Base. With the exception of non-humanoid characters, such as those from the Cars series, each character has a double jump and a default set of attacks, as well as an ability unique to each figure. For example, Sulley can roar to scare others whilst Violet can turn invisible. There are two main modes in this game: Play Set[4] and Toy Box.[5] Each play set is essentially a self-contained world with its own gameplay, based on a specific movie or series with recognizable characters and storylines. Characters from one world cannot enter into another world, but players can put any character together in Toy Box mode. Toy Box is a sandbox mode that players can fully customize and explore.","Publisher":"Disney","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tG8lu6rITCU"},"18133":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Music; Party","Images":[{"FileName":"f0f6f5ed-e895-4487-a28a-b18c3e3da0c4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"34c26813-e632-419e-811f-3e829b9bc692.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d4492139-1b4b-4b8c-856f-2f44039991e6.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c3db83bc-27dd-4b6e-8b2c-24f7c11fc632.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5ac0f4ce-3c3f-46bb-9c32-84c8b3bbe68c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"00ff8900-dac4-4c64-b778-c62c9c813f8a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c09757a6-a3d3-4cbb-9d64-359c944867df.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ac93d3c0-8487-47e6-b6af-e5e14882cb54.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a23449fc-3e7c-447c-9df2-67396ba3e100.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b1ce9cf9-c4b8-4695-bb7d-2acb1a9b57ce.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d0b2da82-60e5-4bc9-957b-29ca00baf247.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a7bf709f-46ed-499e-a247-577a860f9c29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Just Dance 2014","Overview":"World Dance Floor: Dance with anyone anywhere in the world in Just Dance's first-ever online multiplayer mode!

The classic gameplay is retained, but has been streamlined and customized to make it more accessible for the console versions.\n\nPlaying the story mode, the game is set in the year of 1404 and the player takes on the role of Prince William, one of the two sons of King George. The king's domain is suffering from drought and famine. William and his brother Edward are sent out to discover new fertile lands to the south. On the journey the player will come across a new and strange civilization: The Orient.\n\nThe core gameplay is to refine the production of goods and to balance taxes and upkeep costs. The player has to provide his citizens with the needed resources while spending money to expand his nation. Later on in the game he also has to deal with other factions and pirates using economic or military means.\n\nOn the Wii the game is controlled primarily with the Wii-mote, though the nunchuck can also be used for direct camera control. On DS the game is played almost exclusively with the stylus, the buttons only provide shortcut functionality. The story mode features a soft learning curve that helps beginners understand the game. On Wii this is supported by voiceovers.\n\nBoth versions are very identical in terms of story and features, except for the different input control.","Publisher":"Ubisoft","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"18425":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 5","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Music; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a87ba771-2a9c-4d09-919d-3f58f2b7b376.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3a513e12-4623-4eae-84f2-5d2973bc4157.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e932b51-f5e8-41b2-bd29-893f6af0d5ce.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"914bde0c-2620-4275-9ad3-876563b91f21.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"015e1380-be84-4791-bad8-191b797e4d8e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5c604b02-5a74-4b0e-8e1a-5dccda5c4737.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e0dfab9b-933e-4aff-9348-0f15024b90f3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"01cc05ef-5a6f-435e-852c-a130916c92e1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Dance Dance Revolution II","Overview":"Dance Dance Revolution II, later released in Europe as Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 5, is a music video game in the Dance Dance Revolution series by Konami.

Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.\n\nThe player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.\n\nThe battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.\n\nThe troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.\n\nNew troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.","Publisher":"Zoo Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2009-05-05T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2u1P3gd0WGs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzzle_Kingdoms"},"18435":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"5348f66b-d8fd-484b-a00b-0315abf49b4d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"08896a9a-2afe-4a83-8f86-d7ab9ac245e2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6f641768-b7a0-4ac0-b1d3-ea949f707384.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"614d349c-2a47-454b-95a3-73f26af2e1ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1e4343fd-74a1-4e3c-9445-843158f4ed34.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ab2f75ee-8566-415a-8d2b-be292cd3743c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c340d9d7-b1fd-46f7-82c2-17f1a2d89c18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Nicktoons MLB","Overview":"Nicktoons MLB is a baseball game released for the Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS.

Skate It is the only game in the series to not feature the main protagonist of the series, as this is set during the protagonist's incarceration explained in Skate 2.\n\nBecause the Nintendo DS and Wii lack the dual analog joysticks that were used for control in the original game, the controls for Skate It were redesigned to take advantage of each platform's respective control methods. For example, the Wii version utilizes the motion sensing of the Wii Remote to control the player's skateboard, with gestures used to perform tricks, while the Nintendo DS version features stylus and touchscreen control. The Wii version also features support for the Wii Balance Board.\n\nThe Wii version uses a modified version of the original's game engine, supports 480p and widescreen display options, and contains the instant Replay feature from the original game. The Wii version also offers a deep and unique career mode that allows the player to earn sponsors, unlock gear, and travel to places such as London, Barcelona, Paris, Shanghai, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro, a first for the series. In addition, a number of offline and online multiplayer modes are available.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Inc","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skate_It"},"18866":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"オプーナ","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ArtePiazza","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"85626188-2c57-4ec5-8da4-b1a184d66613.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"20a805e6-06d3-4173-9d49-b72ea7def676.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e67bafd2-c357-4bf7-aeb4-0fcd8fa41fb8.PNG","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"10c9e3d0-15f1-4f91-9bbb-4e353f543ef0.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3768e8ab-d65c-4974-ab56-fa9ff4e7a013.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e8086824-df16-4fc3-aa1a-5bce88da14c1.PNG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3a7bd12-8e4b-49e2-a1c6-a93b5bdedc0b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dab3d8fb-3039-4c6a-a748-ef8a9d671c66.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f027fca4-b1f1-4967-b9d0-37af0840bdc4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2c01ae8e-9dee-4f08-beda-847105f48acb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9561b255-5837-46ae-acf1-501a4ff07626.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3f2be76a-ba6b-4dcf-b3f6-5ebdfc26ad6d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"abf19d99-37ff-45dd-a878-a2d2ac6f6b8f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e2541cd7-716f-4656-a57a-16ac5d963d39.png","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"564a4506-f0fb-4dee-b1d3-75c39df61312.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Opoona","Overview":"Opoona (オプーナ Opūna?) is a role-playing video game developed by ArtePiazza and published by Koei for the Wii.

Unlike any other fitness product, when you begin your workout, the camera projects your image onto the TV. Because the camera tracks your movements, your coach can give you real-time input on how you're doing and advice on how to do it better. And, you get all of these benefits without having to hold a controller as you workout, leaving your hands free to focus on the exercises. In fact, the game encourages you to incorporate your own exercise equipment (weights, balance ball, etc). Just tell it what you have at home, and your coach will add it to your personal workout.

Tournaments serve as Shimano Xtreme Fishing's primary game mode, each offering unique scenery, time restrictions, and weather effects, but those simply looking to practice their skills or spend a leisurely day on the water can also roam each environment in \"Free Fish\" mode.","Publisher":"Mastiff","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19474":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Firebrand Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1cdd4de0-bbd6-45d6-aac8-54fdaa757a58.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"08aa8a19-9f68-48c4-87ea-3385cbb10eb7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2cd07f97-67ca-4eba-b323-5d372ce1533f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9b3c6b5f-588d-4750-b5fa-6923b8123e12.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"aaf733a3-4d6c-4b45-9aa5-d32352fff671.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"NASCAR: Unleashed","Overview":"NASCAR Unleashed is an arcade-style racing game that puts superstar drivers on real-world roads, with races run in famous venues such as Daytona, Martinsville, and Chicagoland -- and out in the surrounding city streets, as well.

All it took was one request: \"Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?\"\n\nBased on the classic stop-motion Christmas special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer allows one or two players to play a series of four mini-games based on situations in the special:\n• Holiday Helper - The player(s) bounce presents, lights, stockings, dolls and toys where they belong: either under or on the Christmas tree, or into Santa's sleigh.\n• Toy Maker - The player(s) paint toys.\n• Cookie Cooking - The player(s) attempt to bake cookies for Mrs. Claus.\n• Saving Christmas - Playing as elves, the player(s) drop toys onto houses.\nIn the first three games, the players can choose to be Rudolph, Clarice, Hermey, Yukon Cornelius, or Santa Claus; however there is no difference between characters. Each mini-game is timed, and once time is up, the mini-game is over.","Publisher":"Red Wagon","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-09T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xjsm96C2Iic"},"20865":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's: Master of the Cards","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"91e0564d-1f84-4cff-98b9-cadb046df544.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f85f244c-f465-443a-9941-d8b150399992.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"df0d5f94-fe33-48a0-957d-4ff13cb94dc7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"158fa10c-56be-4ffc-911a-43bb4976384c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"12028d04-ced2-41fa-b3ab-4d24fa674e7b.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4e928297-622c-45cf-844e-ef74b4602709.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"31d7fe72-f831-478a-9a0c-ba6d2909ca69.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"abb1f5ba-2e34-49ab-a447-090aa9c8c78d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"38eb2f3a-eb68-4ef9-9ba0-eed54733b5db.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"22e9442b-8fb5-4765-8994-6475b96fcda5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Duel Transer","Overview":"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Duel Transfer introduces players to all new characters in the most expansive and biggest trading card game on Wii including more than 4,500 playable cards in game.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"2010-12-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"21032":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"School of Darkness","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WayForward","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":"Horror; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"af6a84da-719c-431b-9a3e-804a9fbd9bb8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bc40a09c-39ab-4d01-b637-cbea7103dbb1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c05bde47-df81-4984-b4c7-1250598abcb4.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dc09d203-7788-4310-af09-4c5d8b842ef6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bc3f29a8-41fb-407f-9529-c50d739332f3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a07620ba-aba2-4cc4-be3d-89ab5e5d8e16.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0e0c9d5d-00be-4d44-925b-e64bd1ad6ea7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"LIT","Overview":"LIT is a 3D horror action puzzler that follows Jake, a typical, apathetic, slightly emo teenager, who’s trapped in his high school when it’s overrun by dark creatures.

The goal is to reunite Jake with his girlfriend Rachael, who’s also trapped in the school and calls Jake from time to time on the school’s phone system. Stay in the light and Jake’s safe. Step into the darkness and he’s pulled under.\n\nIn addition to light puzzling, the game features 5 boss battles against dark faculty members, an unlockable challenge mode, multiple endings, level select mode, and a second playable character.

Select your favorites and nurture them to adulthood. Feeding them, petting them, and cleaning up their messes is a great way to form a lasting bond. Each animal's personality will change depending on how you take care of them. Watch them get spoiled, turn into over-eaters, and more as they grow on a daily basis. Some animals will even have a baby on occasion, and once it's born, you've got another mouth to feed. Game time passes much more quickly than real time, and the different animal types are active at various hours--some during the day, and some at night. Sometimes it's fun to just kick back and watch what they do. So what are you waiting for?

The game is based on the popular board game Pictionary, in which players draw pictures based on clues from a subject and have their teammates guess what specific words the picture is supposed to represent. It was released on November 14, 2010 for the Nintendo Wii game system.\n\nDesigned as a multi-player game or party game for all ages, players can choose teams of up to four people to play. Since the uDraw GameTablet comes bundled with uDraw Studio, another art-based video game, players can familiarize themselves with how the tablet and stylus pen work before playing, as well as how to draw, color and sketch on the tablet. uDraw Pictionary includes more than 3,000 clues, with traditional Adult Clues like Object, Difficult and Action or Junior Clues like “Animal Houses” and “At the Zoo” for younger players. The game differs somewhat from classic Pictionary, as the video game has new draw modes. The normal Pictionary mode lets users play the game show-style on a 3D game board with a variety of drawing tools, brushes and colors to choose from for a livelier sketching experience. Pictionary Mania has a custom game board and seven new draw modes, including Get It Straight, Shape It Up, Rotation Frustration, One Line, Ink Limit, No Peeking and Off Hand. Free Draw lets players use the drawing tools in the uDraw GameTablet to create works of art.","Publisher":"THQ","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"22794":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"EA SPorts","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"4bde1afb-6bc6-431c-a393-c4f0b2dc202d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"78ec2a56-f78e-4296-89e3-68aa04ec8a18.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1eb7bf6a-3602-4a81-9785-a2c299cc9baf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"aeba4a44-a870-4a41-ab95-5decc61ccc69.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"FIFA 15","Overview":"Play traditional 11 versus 11 matches with over 500 officially licensed clubs or free your game on the streets in 5 versus 5 street matches.

The game was first released for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 in North America, and on May 26, 2006 in Europe. It was later released for the Wii on October 17, 2007 in North America, and on October 19, 2007 in Europe. The game is a realistic simulation of the sport table tennis, with the main objective to make the opponent fail to hit the ball.\n\nThe game features various methods of serving and returning the ball, designed for players to beat their opponent. Players can compete against the game's artificial intelligence, while the game's multiplayer mode lets two players compete in matches, either through local multiplayer or online. Initially developed specifically for the Xbox 360 console, the development team took advantage of the hardware's graphical power, allowing the game to play at a faster pace than with previous hardware. The game was the first to be developed using Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, later used in games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption.\n\nIts announcement in March 2006 led to confusion and surprise, due to its significantly different style from Rockstar's previous projects. It received generally positive reviews upon release, with praise particularly directed at its simplicity, replayability and detailed visuals","Publisher":"Rockstar Games","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-16T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rockstar_Games_Presents_Table_Tennis"},"23737":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Leviathan Games","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ebce8f16-31de-48ba-8baf-9f3347a2719b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8124d067-6c09-4db9-9aa4-10a8b9899aae.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04c444c3-acc5-4eaf-ab15-973b8ea997a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e20f55ea-5837-4803-ba0a-15b3ba76c274.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"0875e0e0-d0fc-4ffc-940a-c6b874d1b1e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2167e2c6-7f71-4634-a294-a8bf44f53197.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7fed2f72-852c-4f5d-b708-31e20161de88.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Target: Terror","Overview":"Terror puts you in the place of an elite anti-terrorist agent who is charged with protecting the U.S. from all terrorist activities.

The game was released September 24, 2010, in Europe, September 28, 2010, in North America and September 29, 2010, in Australia. It is the last game in the series to be developed by Neversoft, due to weak sales in the rhythm game market from 2009. It is also the first game in the series not to distributed by RedOctane. The Wii version was solely developed by Vicarious Visions who were to take over future development of the Guitar Hero series before it was placed on hiatus. The game received mixed reviews from gaming journalists, praising certain highlights such as the \"2112\" segment and the game's improved Quickplay+ mode, but citing other elements as lackluster as the Quest mode's story or the lack of focus within the soundtrack.

Up to 4 players (human or CPU controlled) can control a character and fight on a multi-tiered 2D stage. Players may use various items that appear randomly to get the fighting edge over their opponent. Additionally, the stage may use set elements in order to take out other players. For example, in the Dexter's Lab Stage players can pull 2 different levers, one setting off a conveyor belt, and the other firing a deadly laser.\n\nWhen players strike one another, glowing cubes will fall out of them. If players collect enough of these cubes, they will fill up their special meter that, when full, unleashes a powerful \"Punch Time Explosion\" (the equivalent of a Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) attack against their opponents. For example, Ben Tennyson turns into Ultimate Humungosaur and launches missiles all over the stage.\n\nIn the XL version, fighting characters can team up with certain assist characters (the equivalents of Assist Trophies) and do Synergy attacks. For example, Madame Foster brings a plate of cookies to the arena, Chowder eats them, turning fat, and Madame Foster rolls him around the stage.\n\nEach playable character has their own special move set that uses different elements from their respective TV shows. Each has an up, down, side, and neutral attack. Most characters have a projectile attack. Captain K'nuckles is the only character who has a disabling attack.","Publisher":"Crave Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"28382":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"9cd9ea8d-17fb-40bd-bdd1-02d9efbcbeac.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5df9781-599c-4281-9ab1-bb73900a029a.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"85a6475c-5bb7-4670-90b4-341766fb1f4b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"05e97b9a-a785-4f51-be2d-7810c90a7f93.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"648f239e-4ac1-451e-80e9-d8aaa604e881.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0f1559da-75ba-4bef-8696-f216bf9f9363.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Project M Community","Overview":"Project M is a community-made mod of Brawl inspired by Super Smash Bros.

The objective is to clear each stage within the planet's three areas: the lush and tropical Atoll, the glacial and snowy Northpole, and the toxic and jungle-like Swamps. Within each stage lies a set number of solar cells, many of which are scattered about and some of which are hidden, that Jett must collect in order to unlock each stage and gain access to the subsequent areas. Additionally, Jett must defeat a general of the PPP at the end of each area. As with standard platforming games, Jett is capable of jumping, but can briefly hover when using his jet pack.[4] Within certain stages, he can also paraglide as well as either ride a hoverboard or a jetboat. In addition, Jett can defeat enemies, clear obstacles and activate switches with his \"Dash\" attack, which can be executed by shaking the Wii Remote while he is standing (which sees him perform a somersaulting tackle) or after a jump (which sees him perform a diving hammer fist). The game also features an achievement system that can be completed either during or after completion of the main story.","Publisher":"Shin'en Multimedia","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ntIr9CJ1YXI"},"29536":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Riverman Media","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"e064051d-c317-423d-9e87-0576cadd99b2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"58a28b6b-ce2b-4866-b87e-cabca2969dc9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d52335e7-721e-400f-a680-896fa83e52dd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"91161272-d44d-4a4d-88ab-031e1b813b12.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a09c6144-eecb-4721-b4f5-8dc781dd826c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"35daff3f-3804-40d4-b17c-836b73107abf.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9b5eecf8-2a61-411e-b06d-1540ce39556a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"MadStone","Overview":"MadStone is a puzzle game in which players must break apart blocks to help special gems (called MadStones) drop down to a pool at the bottom of the screen through their own weight and gravity.

This has clear implications on the game environment: walls become floors, tunnels may suddenly be used as downward slides and a stone resting on the ground may fall, becoming either a dangerous obstacle or useful object for catapulting.\n\n\n\nTo successfully progress through a level, you must apply the physical consequences of rotating the world to the avatar and to other moving objects, like stones, drops of water and branches, as well as to living things, such as bats, monkeys and much more.\n\n\n\nAnd Yet It Moves is notable for its polished, focused gameplay and unique artistic style. Each object, plant or animal that the player encounters is ripped out of a photo or movie image and brought to life using current real-time rendering techniques. Every level was designed through a meticulous handmade process, including various back- and foreground layers, making it more interesting to play through.\n\n\n\nTake on 17 levels where you jump, run, and rotate the world in 90 degree intervals to progress.\n\n\n\nSolve mind-bending puzzles set in an extraordinary paper collage world, with three different environments, enriched and brought to life with handmade sounds and music.\n\n\n\nGo for the high score by challenging your friends and polish your skills of rotation.","Publisher":"Broken Rules","ReleaseDate":"2010-08-23T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/And_Yet_It_Moves"},"121748":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Anima Game Studio","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6a0b95cc-4f9a-4584-8a06-2c54f8fbcf48.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6bf74b73-90b2-4a19-a0da-bdea462d1087.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"95e1714b-2a6b-49d8-9c30-979c8f0a8008.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c9738ff-dd6e-4ac0-89c5-3dfbfeb36807.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d7f0a0d5-8bd9-4006-8856-bf5beb6d2cf5.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b8a397e2-28ff-48ad-9418-124d4223709e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e4d79ac6-b3b9-41e2-a6c8-2f1c9deefdcd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0aaca703-5a3c-4493-a6db-4c9290e10e6f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"ANIMA: Ark of Sinners","Overview":"Ark.

Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles, and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. \n\n\n\nAfter playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: either reaching a particular length with your tentacles or growing them to the greatest length possible. Regardless of mode though, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies, known as goobugs, by touching them. Just one catch: successfully absorbing a goobug depends on its color matching the color of your tentacle. Adding to the challenge, longer tentacles can more easily touch incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force) and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the life force-restoring heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. \n\n\n\nWith atmospheres ranging from peaceful calm to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels. Victory can only be achieved through quick, but precise, movement and the ability to remain calm under pressure. Are you ready to take on the goobugs? \n\n\n\nGames in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics, and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on fun and engaging game play.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2010-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"121781":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Sudden Games","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"f29bef5c-5404-4f20-bd3e-8bad17091bb8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c9a80af0-d09c-4272-9a28-07eae976ce76.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e888411d-9a10-4d88-916c-2bea619f8590.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"21c9ccbb-a0e7-4c66-b997-8a6dd6e20c7c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Astro Bugz: Revenge","Overview":"Battle against bugz invasion in a sci-fi marble popper arcade. \n\nAstro Bugz is an action-puzzle game with a retro vibe.

The wild and far West! Come and see the fastest cowboy in action; you will visit a typical western town, with its grand saloon, its sheriff office, and its bank. Here you will meet the classic doctor, the powerful “master of the land”, an industrious pioneer, and men and women who, with their blood, their sweat, and their tears, raised a great nation. \n\nBut there are things that cannot be helped, and one of them, very typical in the West, is the continuous fights between farmers and cattle ranchers. And if farmers used to win the sympathy of most people, the truth is that cattle ranchers always had victory in their hands. They had more money and more men; they were very powerful and very strong. Only a cowboy as peculiar as Fenimore Fillmore could side with the farmers when the rest of the cowboys were paid by the cattle rancher, the most merciless and sinister of characters in the game.","Publisher":"Planeta DeAgostini","ReleaseDate":"2010-09-06T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_WiiWare_games"},"122909":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"My Fireplace","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Continental Producciones","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"a38f0f20-159e-4c60-9cae-31d345d5c146.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8e9efd5e-fd59-43aa-9797-80c6ecd2f313.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b4f33d91-0c6a-417a-8599-11e2e03e37cd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b9b725af-ff31-4f3f-9aeb-03a4a13575c6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c72491f6-95dd-4a1b-9ba5-c43ada1257ff.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"789d8501-0c23-4a47-b157-ece8f2eb197e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fireplacing","Overview":"Who wouldn’t like to have a fireplace at home?\n\nNow you can turn your television into a fireplace, equipped with realistic graphics and a fire that will almost burn you.

Playing the game is as easy as tossing a disc around on a beautiful day. The goal of the game is to put the disc in the basket in the fewest amount of throws possible. Disc golfers have three different types of discs at their disposal when out on the course: a driver, a mid-range disc, and a putter. Also, there are three different types of throw available: forehand, backhand, and the hammer throw. The forehand and backhand throws change based on the handedness of the player, and can be used to draw or fade a shot, while the hammer throw is less about distance and more about height.

As the title 'Minna de Party' would suggest, Taiko Wii 3 places emphasis back on the Wii casual audience, allowing up to 4 players on one screen at the same time, which hasn't ever been done before. It's cramped, but it works fine. To add to it, the main gimmick this time are the seven minigames of the Dream Taiko Land, 4 of which involve drumming skills, and the remaining three harks back to the PS2-era minigames, which is a welcome addition.\n\nThat isn't to say Taiko Wii 3 has ignored the fans of the Oni metagame though. Continuing on from Taiko Wii 2, Minna de Party finishes off the remaining Taiko 13\/14 generation songs not already seen in Wii2\/DS3. And in a very unexpected twist, after several unremarkable unlocks involving old songs (though they've been updated well enough to justify their presence), the Ura Oni unlock presented many surprises, giving many popular and new songs Ura Oni difficulties never before seen on any arcade (previously, Taiko Wii 2 simply ported Ura Onis from arcades, but didn't introduce any new ones). Many unexpected new songs came through Wii 3, including the Xbox 360 music Doom Noiz from Galaga Legions, and a new, unconventional 2000 song.\n\nIn other minor news, the loading screen has been tweaked to feature less blinding colors and now shows the song title while waiting for the song to start playing. Returning Wii features like Everyday Taiko Dojo, Miis, song lyrics and the mailbox are here, though there are no costumes or alternate Don-chan voice samples like in the previous games. Also the first Taiko game to not stick strictly to the number of songs as advertised, featuring 71 songs instead of 70 in all other promotional material.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseDate":"2010-12-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I0ZztYjheNo"},"126760":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Icon Games Entertainment","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"43548f5d-1e57-4887-ae53-155a4cd1038f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2974148f-e505-4ef9-a552-baf771029bff.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c62f57a9-dae8-44cd-b4fc-77d3169a5a67.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9fdcbba5-d064-4af8-9add-e1efcbd8298d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"179b311a-7d5b-4b3f-87fd-8cc7a28cb8e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Build 'n Race","Overview":"Rev your engines for a fantastic heart-pounding racing experience exclusively for Wii!

The stats speak for themselves: the game has 25 of the world’s most dangerous animals, including lions, grizzly bears, Cape buffalo, rhino, jaguars and more in 9 exotic, rugged locations like the South American jungle, Alaskan wilderness, and the Russian tundra. To top it off, ferocious beasts aren't the only way you can meet your maker - you must survive plane crashes and boat down treacherous rivers, as well as avoid avalanches, stampedes, and piranha-infested waters. You play as Flint Abrahams, a seasoned big game hunter on a quest to hunt the world's deadliest trophies.

Brawl- notably eclipsed the popularity of Brawl+ after its release, and it was even featured at some tournaments as a side event, such as at Apex 2010. Its popularity has since been overtaken by Project M, but Brawl- still maintains a devoted cult following, and development of the mod has continued into the present day, making it one of the oldest mods for Brawl that remains in active development; version 4.0BC notably features Pichu, Mewtwo, Roy, and Waluigi as additions to the character roster.","ReleaseType":"ROM Hack","ReleaseYear":2010,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0gxSk_7Ohx8"},"140521":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"dtp entertainment AG","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"4648552f-c019-46db-83f0-838f966a12bc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6c9e0aa2-586d-4aed-ad57-4c5b90005501.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5e282d15-bbf4-41d8-8b53-1561b1509fc5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4bcf7a07-cd4e-4183-bada-01403e4d975f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7a81d1cb-4214-4367-a6d7-147ce8eda5b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d327a607-7282-4e52-9142-b270600d65de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"TNT Racers","Overview":"Have you got what it takes to outrun your rivals?\n\nTNT Racers is a fun multiplayer racing game full of variety, combining fast as lightning race action with brand new features.

Typical elements of the Lucha Libre wrestling style are colourful masks, rapid maneuvers and many high-flying moves. The Luchadores (wrestlers) can pull off different kinds of moves including holds, submissions and pins. In the top corners the status of the wrestlers is shown. When hit, the targeted body part is highlighted and a score is awarded. Targeting the same area repeatedly makes a wrestler weaker. Taunts and moves fill up a series of stars. Once full the wrestler is able to executive a finisher by pushing both triggers at the same time. When pinned down a button needs to be pressed rapidly to break it. The face buttons are used to strike and the shoulder buttons provide grapples. There are different types of attack (weak, strong, kick), block\/counter, the ability to run, recovery, and two types of grapple.\n\nThe game can be played at different venues and supports multiplayer both offline and online. There is no tag team system however, but players can go one-on-one or against up to four opponents. The environment is not used to provide alternative ways of fighting. There are however some weapons on the ground, such as a chair and a light bulb. In the story mode a faction and a specific wrestler can be chosen. Wrestlers can be customized based on body build, skin colour, face, hair, mask style, and wardrobe. There is a tutorial and cut-scenes that explain the culture behind it.","Publisher":"Slang","ReleaseDate":"2011-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"153249":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"a23e589c-5193-4730-92bf-2896aee3dec1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"209b7105-020e-492f-a359-65dfea20f1c6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9370707b-6605-4695-ae85-42e5aff64f99.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"165003ff-4003-480d-949c-46c1490570b0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5fcabfb-5657-4b40-9d4a-2d868eb02d0d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"49091676-55f9-4081-81d7-65494fb8e5ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"I Love Horses: Rider's Paradise","Overview":"Make your dreams come to life by riding in Riders Paradise!

EX","Overview":"Gameplay Edit\nThe game uses the Wii Remote in unison with the Nunchuk by waving the controller in different directions, but the GameCube controller and the Wii Classic controller can be used with the game as well. Also new to the system are plane switches, where characters after hitting their opponents with a hard flying attack force them out via a cinematic, where they rush after them to a new area of the stage. During this time, the one who sent the foe flying can either chose to do nothing and let them fall to the ground in the new area, teleport behind them to give them even fair ground in landing, attack them or teleport out of sight and behind them in the new area to open them up to combos via a ground bounce from a fall. However, the one sent flying with proper timing in response to the pursuer can counter these actions by dodging or recovering, making it a bit of a Quick-Time Event. This function becomes a mainstay for the whole Wii sub series of the Gekitō Ninja Taisen\/Clash of Ninja series.\n\nAlso new and part of the mainstay are objects on the arena where characters can move next to in order to hide behind. Doing so they can perform one of their many attacks after slipping out of cover, hop over the object to assault the foe with midair attacks, or simply dodge away from the object. Both players can hide behind the same object, and they can be damaged and broken, leaving the hiding character in a stagger if they are happening to be hiding behind one of them. Characters can also knock each other into the objects with attacks for a \"wallbounce\" effect seen in more traditional fighters.\n\nThe game takes place during the Naruto: Shippūden series, specifically the first ten episodes of the Kazekage Rescue Mission. The game contains re-done Shippūden versions of 12 characters from the previous games in the series and two new characters specifically from the Shippūden series.","Publisher":"Takara Tomy","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2007,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/naruto.wikia.com\/wiki\/Naruto_Shipp%C5%ABden:_Gekit%C5%8D_Ninja_Taisen!_EX"},"155336":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Crave Entertainment","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"6452f051-664a-4dd5-a7c3-2d8575433e86.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"cc1f5c0e-dee3-45b3-9cb8-5983c312b7b3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"398f8ecb-b4e3-473e-b7b7-d1ceb741d8a2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"58ef5d68-364a-4055-9d71-dd363fab5d26.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9a108aa1-cadc-4882-9011-18afbebcd307.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5cf29bb6-f013-4774-bb78-c3b4770c49f1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7b4b2968-3bf0-4a23-8a29-ada9547632c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crayola Colorful Journey","Overview":"Something's wrong in Crayola Land!

This game is technically a Gokaiger game, but as they are not the only ones you can play as, this is why the game is called Super Sentai Battle and not Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger.\n\nThe teams you can play as are:\n\nKaizoku Sentai Gokaiger (2011)\nSamurai Sentai Shinkenger (2009)\nTensou Sentai Goseiger (2010)\nEngine Sentai Go-Onger (2008)\nHimitsu Sentai Goranger (1975-1976)\nThis would be the first time a non-Heisei era team would be playable in any Super Sentai game that was not a crossover with other franchises, as Goranger was the first season of Super Sentai.

The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).\n\nThe cube is \"sticky\" and as such it is able to roll to the sides of the bottom of a track to approach an area from a different direction or to collect new items. Only special squares cannot be moved over. The camera can also be rotated around the cube to view the environment before moving. Certain levels are time limited. The game includes a level editor and new levels can be stored and shared with friends. Multiplayer is available over Wi-Fi with the modes Battle, Co-Op, Collect and Race. While progressing players can unlock new music tracks.","Publisher":"Objective Production Limited","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2012},"166326":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CyberPlanet Interactive","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Life Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"18cdf93b-50d2-4a29-bead-0a9f6d6b9231.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"71c920fc-4168-46ae-a4fd-ee36d3ac0c2a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6158f3c0-6568-46e7-abc6-736c3ea0b340.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"acceb775-c984-4182-ba45-f88e1ca4e0b2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a9060a92-415e-4e55-9325-a8d505d7a0a2.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5ebe9ebf-6271-4de9-8489-651cb1ab2a2d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dream Salon","Overview":"In Dream Salon you play as Jenny, a recent graduate of the New York Beauty Academy, and help build her career as she styles model after model, creating the ultimate fashionistas!

Since it is the Future Arc, Tsuna is a powered-up version of himself and this is evident during the first battle against Gokudera.

Gokudera's dynamite-throwing antics just aren't any match against a firebrand like Tsuna. \n\n   The 16 fighters in the game are culled from the Hitman mange\/anime series and include Yamamoto, Dino, Lambo, Chrome, Hibari, and more.

Along with one-on-one mission-based battles, teams of fighters also go to war within an expansive 3D battlefield.\n\n   Hitman Reborn features the \"Battle Range System\" where attacks may be customized in term of Short, Middle, and Long range offensive moves.   The Wii version of the game uses both the Nunchuk and Wii Remote for the controls. The Nunchuk moves the main character while the \"Z\" button is used to activate a dash move.

The objective of the game is to become the top-ranked \"Super Chibi-Robo\" in the world by accumulating Happy Points, a collectible gained by doing good deeds for the family and for various toys in the Sandersons' home.[6][7][8][9][14] In order to do this, the player must control Chibi-Robo and explore the Sandersons' home. During exploration, Chibi-Robo can find a wide variety of things to collect, including \"Moolah\", the currency of Chibi-Robo!. An important task in gaining Happy Points is to clean up messes around the house, such as disposing of trash or scrubbing dirty footprints.[7] The player can also interact with and help with the personal problems of the Sandersons and the toys. This ranges from solving a plot-driving crisis or completing a subquest of simply locating a lost object as a favor.[6][8][9] With Chibi-Robo's assistant Telly Vision as his speaker, the player is often prompted to give either a positive or negative response to each question or request.[8] The player loses battery power with every step and action. If his battery is not charged before it empties, Chibi-Robo will collapse and re-emerge in the Chibi-House, having lost half of his Moolah.[8] Throughout the house are electrical outlets, which the player can plug into to recharge his battery or save his progress.[7][14] The player's exploration is limited by a timer representing a full day or full night. Once the timer expires, Chibi-Robo automatically returns to the Chibi-House.[9]\n\nThere are three collectibles in the game. One is the stickers, which can be obtained throughout the game, either by completing the game, completing quests, playing mini-games, or doing simple tasks for other non-player characters. The Second is the Frog Rings which can be collected and given to Jenny, the daughter of the Sanderson household, for Happy Points and a sticker. The third is the crayons found throughout the house which can be deposited in a crayon box for Happy Points.\n\nAt the start of both day and night, the player begins in the Chibi-House, where they can charge Chibi-Robo's battery, save at the electrical outlet, or connect to the Citrusoft \"Chibi-PC\" to purchase a variety of items and power-ups with Moolah and use scrap metal to build \"Utilibots\", robotic helpers that ease the navigation of the Sandersons' home.[7][14] The gear available from Citrusoft includes the \"Chibi-Copter\", used to reach far-off points or fly down from a high place safely; the \"Chibi-Blaster\", used to eliminate obstacles and fend off the hostile Spydorz; and the \"Chibi-Radar\", used to detect hidden objects.[6][8] There are several other items of the Sandersons' that Chibi-Robo can find and use. These include the toothbrush, used to clean up stains; the coffee mug, used for protection; the spoon, used to dig holes; and the squirter, used to hold fluids and squirt them.[6][8] Chibi-Robo can also gain special costumes throughout the game, each of which has its own function.[7] For instance, if the player poses for Mr. Sanderson while wearing The Drake Redcrest costume, he will give Chibi-Robo Happy Points. As more Happy Points are acquired, the player's rank increases among all the Chibi-Robos in the world. At certain ranks, Citrusoft will send the player bonus batteries, allowing Chibi-Robo to roam longer without having to recharge until they earn the status of \"Super Chibi-Robo\", which earns the player unlimited battery life.[14]","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2009-06-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chibi-Robo!"},"167028":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MileStone Inc.","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"675f688d-a26f-471d-9124-bed2b1571f84.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d48c0f23-6f72-440c-8024-263c9b3e4c2f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Milestone Shooting Collection 2","Publisher":"MileStone Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2010-12-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"167515":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"仮面ライダー 超クライマックスヒーローズ","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eighting","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"3809d34e-b9ba-48f0-9b79-c6b11a6d67ab.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b096e76-abfc-4da0-b3a5-2ea5ec1211a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Kamen Rider: Super Climax Heroes","Overview":"Kamen Rider: Super Climax Heroes (仮面ライダー 超クライマックスヒーローズ Kamen Raidā Sūpā Kuraimakkusu Hīrōzu) was released on November 29, 2012 for PlayStation Portable and Wii, with the addition of several new playable characters such as Kamen Rider Wizard, Kamen Rider Meteor from Kamen Rider Fourze, and secondary Riders such as Gills, Chalice and Sasword from other series.

While the game originally began development as a WiiWare game, that version was cancelled as Yuji Naka began adding more features and ideas.\n\nThe objective in the game is to lead the character, Ivy, a newly born bird, to her lost mother. The game is similar to Kirby: Canvas Curse because the player does not directly control the main character. In the game, Ivy is constantly moving directly right or left, unless presented with something in her way, in which case she turns around and moves the other direction. The player takes advantage of this by drawing lines to guide the chick away from danger and to the goal. The player can make ramp lines to have Ivy walk up or down, make vertical lines to reverse her direction, or pull the vines and slingshot Ivy in a given direction. Ultimately, the player must lead Ivy away from obstacles such as spikes or rats and to the end goal.\n\nThe game features several different modes. The main game is where levels are simply played in order. Another mode lets the player play any level that has been previously played in the main game to try and beat the high scores. There are also two different ways to play multiplayer. One is the competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete to see who can get their Kiwi to the goal the fastest, the tricky part being that any player can interact with any other player's Kiwi as well. Separately from this mode, at any point, up to four players can choose to play cooperatively to help the first player in the main game.\n\nAccording to lead designer Yuji Naka, there are various reasons that the game's unusual title has a question mark. Reasons include piquing curiosity in potential players to pick up the game, as well as playing a role in the game's story regarding Ivy's identity.","Publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ivy_the_Kiwi%3F#Version_differences"},"176885":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Let's Sing 2017","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Ravenscourt","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Music","Images":[{"FileName":"1f914f92-fb7b-448b-83ab-4c063aad3d96.JPG","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Let's Sing 2017: mit deutschen Hits","Overview":"Zeit für die nächste Karaoke-Party!

The first, Soul Eater: Monotone Princess, is an action-adventure video game exclusively for the Wii and developed by Square Enix with Bones. It was released on September 25, 2008 in Japan. Two characters that appear in the game, Grimoire and Ponera, are original characters designed by author Atsushi Ōkubo; Ponera is the titular Monotone Princess and Grimoire is known as Noah in the manga.\n\nThe player controls a Meister, either Maka, Black Star or Death the Kid, accompanied by their Weapon partner to fight those masked creatures. The game is separated in a number of missions leading to a boss fight. A number of foes, displayed in the lower-right corner, must be found and defeated in each stage. While exploring, the Weapon follows the Meister in human form, and changes into a weapon when enemies are encountered.

The concept of this innovative game is simple, the player takes on the role of a skyscraper climber and aim to board the helicopter at the top of the building. Although the concept is simple, the game itself is very challenging as there are many obstacles that you have to overcome to reach the top. Window shutters open and close to break your hand holds, residents of the building attempt to kill you by throwing flower pots and other heavy stuff at you. And as you climb higher and higher, you will come across monsters that are living on the buildings and think it's fun to swing themselves at you and see you drop to your death.\n\n25 years later, this classic game is remade for the Nintendo Wii console. With your Wiimote control in one hand and the nunchaku in the other, you are ready to attempt to break your (or your player character's) neck from the comfort of your living room. The game offers four characters to choose from and a vast amount of carefully sculpted high rises for your climbing pleasure. The demented residents are back to throw things at you and so are the monsters.\n\nPlaying alone generates a huge amount of fun, but you can also play this game at a party with a group of friends. The one person mode offers a set of six fixed stages and an unlimited amount of stages thereafter, while the group mode supports four stages and one secret stage.","Publisher":"Nihon System","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"181932":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Natsume","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8a07f106-575a-4656-b0da-660244294559.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a71779bf-07b7-4e78-9c21-81f11459bfc7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35926f25-31fe-46f6-8e72-6c208d93514e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Gintama: Yorozuya Chuubu: Tsukkomable Douga","Publisher":"Bandai Namco Games","ReleaseDate":"2007-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"181933":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Negima!

As Mario, the player explores Princess Peach's castle and must rescue her from Bowser. Super Mario 64 features open-world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites. It emphasizes exploration within vast worlds, which require the player to complete various missions in addition to the occasional linear obstacle courses (as in traditional platform games). It preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games as well as the visual style.\n\nProducer\/director and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a 3D Mario game during the production of Star Fox (1993). Super Mario 64's development, handled by Nintendo EAD, lasted approximately three years; one was spent on designing, the next two on direct work. The visuals were created using the Nichimen N-World toolkit, with Miyamoto aiming to include more details than earlier games. The score was composed by Koji Kondo. A multiplayer mode featuring Mario's brother Luigi was cut, and rumors spread of his inclusion as a hidden character. Along with Pilotwings 64, Super Mario 64 was one of the launch games for the Nintendo 64. Nintendo released it in Japan on June 23, 1996, and later in North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\nSuper Mario 64 is acclaimed as one of the greatest video games of all time, and was the first game to receive a perfect score from Edge magazine. Reviewers praised its ambition, visuals, gameplay, and music, although they criticized its unreliable camera system. It is the Nintendo 64's bestseller, with more than eleven million copies sold by 2003. It left a lasting impression on the field of 3D game design, featuring a dynamic camera system and 360-degree analog control, and established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D side-scrolling platformers. Numerous developers have cited Super Mario 64 as an influence. It was remade as Super Mario 64 DS for the Nintendo DS in 2004, and it has been ported to other Nintendo consoles.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":"2007-02-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vT3AaQ77ges","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Mario_64"},"190527":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SIMS","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"9b9561e9-420c-40b5-9be7-057157b479e4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"72955a51-6a94-455c-be1c-b15b8aadd0c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Bass Fishing Wii World Tournament","Publisher":"Arc System Works","ReleaseDate":"2010-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"190544":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"人生ゲームWii","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"인생 게임 Wii","Region":"Korea"},{"AlternateName":"人生遊戲(日)","Region":"China"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Board Game; Party","Images":[{"FileName":"05538deb-7685-43f1-929e-dd0d6b0fdeaa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6f0a967e-0eb1-41c6-8b94-55e8ba3385bb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5c0061a9-c27b-45ed-a57b-3deab93dcaf4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6379af95-6ccc-48be-940b-18db40784a48.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7d0ddeb4-e321-4d67-99a7-f8b5fd54c795.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Jinsei Game Wii","Publisher":"Tomy","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"190875":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rocket Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"d948fa8d-f081-444e-879c-3406f606677d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d8771d4d-a116-439a-bcd9-0eccefa58503.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cfd421b8-e099-4dc5-9ada-d7c39472ce9c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43b85a43-63ef-4c06-9c75-cf5f6d062910.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Billy's Bootcamp: Wii de enojoy diet!","Overview":"Billy's Boot Camp: Wii de Enjoy Diet!
