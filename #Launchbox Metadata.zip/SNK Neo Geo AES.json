With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily. \n\nThe attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high-ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army's intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever. \n\nMeanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile. \n\nThe announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named \"Resistants\" are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat-ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter-offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks. \n\nSeeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion. \n\nThe player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and \"Metal Slug\" tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.\nThe protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and\/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.\n\nDuring the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.\nThere are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-05-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qsMWIbnKrqk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Slug_(1996_video_game)"},"223":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b266aa2d-00e0-4ffb-b9f5-7d5c79638a21.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c98257f2-c1bc-4f2f-b1c8-0e7c9eded225.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"553f228f-4229-4be5-88a3-601ad6372c53.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fec843ae-7c01-49b2-b736-438870af5148.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c1d92039-6e07-4392-988a-e484e21d35e8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8521a5c3-80a6-4836-a56b-2de72525f7dc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"eccaee92-4bc7-43e6-829d-508202867a68.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f70af7f8-46ae-4520-b520-6455154bafd9.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"64685f41-a720-4add-93b4-0dd7280ed3a4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"b85a9db2-b997-4303-8aac-3389e6c5fefd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Metal Slug 2: Super Vehicle: 001\/II","Overview":"General Morden, the antagonist from the first game is back once more with his army, bent on taking over the world.

One village was full of men, and the other full of women. The two villages didn't get along and were always fighting, so the gods built a tower and wall between them to stop the conflict. However, this caused even more problems for everyone, because the tower blocked all the sunlight to both villages. The village of men sent out a boy and the village of women sent out a girl to travel in hot air balloons to the top of the tower to ask the sun god to remove the barrier.\n\nPuzzled is a puzzle game similar to Tetris, but instead of clearing lines, the player's goal is to clear a path for their balloon to travel upwards. Every time blocks are cleared, a meter is slightly filled. When the meter is filled one third or higher, the player can unleash the Lightning Ball, or L-Ball, to automatically clear blocks around them in a Breakout-like fashion.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-ar3NP0hNOI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzzled_(video_game)"},"1338":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7a0bdd0e-eb7c-4a78-ab0c-7b401bb9167e.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"e105cd2a-f55f-470b-aa76-7940358c9dab.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"d7e8ac1c-e92c-4188-b9d1-1db1a33483e8.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"15cd3990-76ed-40fa-8199-13bda8cfcf48.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a72f30fe-49a9-4a4e-9f89-76a5ab3cfc4b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b4f6f447-fbba-4560-ab52-5278901f48d8.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7e7667a1-0076-4d13-a11e-bd3307456aff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"95fd63c0-3cc0-467b-b04d-241e2712e2b0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ec7ff739-7c20-4510-908e-817abd1fe6e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ee2c2663-f36b-4892-a00f-2d2e43a15438.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c1933a3c-5137-4719-9bbe-f8fe3469df53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1a685ea6-c121-4bdd-8da8-90cd024b7b44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"NAM-1975","Overview":"As a soldier, you and\/or a friend must travel through Vietnam to stop the scientist and his world destroying laser machine.

Attacks between planes have returned but are now called \"Oversway Attacks\" and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special & super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round.\n\nAlong with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they'll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both. Overall,  Fatal Fury 3  was easily the best presentation of the series to date.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-21T00:00:00-07:00"},"1492":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"9d690cc6-d9f6-45eb-b795-be55da2cad12.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b53ce092-f712-47ad-9415-efbbd4ec777b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2dba289b-fd5b-49db-86e0-3f9fa1d98f98.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f8bbc35d-71af-44c0-b656-bdea269b697c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a945bf8-0246-48ba-8ea8-3a2b0d9288b4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e1286acf-8845-46d9-8bac-baeb3d0a2b4f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9734e6fc-6591-4e2d-a456-6a9f88e6a1f0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"86fb7055-989c-4561-ba42-6732c645a703.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d97c34b1-1c29-4fd0-b5b0-c4eb3274359c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"74179f7b-88f8-4b87-8d4f-0a7bcbb87f3d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d4032d5e-85ba-4439-aa02-4f3cab4d8d0b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c27bd591-866b-4f88-a1a1-206515f40515.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e6e4774a-d201-4589-8a3d-723c813119bf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"029a136a-db7b-4240-a682-86ee9fb7d8b1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d46f123-4ad9-413d-a8a0-2d22b1fb00b3.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Fatal Fury Special","Overview":"Geese Howard: a man feared by the world as the dark ruler of South Town.

As such, the background music generally incorporates synthesized instruments simulating a sound appropriate to the 19th century setting, in a Western classical, pseudo-Romantic style (unusual for a fighting game).","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1998-01-29T00:00:00-08:00"},"1510":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Bakumatsu Roman: Dai Ni Maku Gekka no Kenshi","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"7816ff92-2de1-406f-ad11-3e0bc9fa4772.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9420bd77-72fd-4891-8b01-5693d9ad6608.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9d24ca8a-caed-468a-be28-1e9331c6058f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b2ee1cd-c80c-4a16-b3d2-4e1497124cec.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3707f04c-c9df-4fc9-a209-420abe7c3b74.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fd647898-7a16-4d3b-9e3f-64fb96dfda82.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ca303762-0011-4a9f-85b6-af7a15c4722f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7458c164-e931-4bde-90fc-0560d692f036.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Last Blade 2","Overview":"The Last Blade 2 picks up where the previous title left off and takes the story of battling at the gates of hell to its climax.

The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special \"boss\" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twinkle_Star_Sprites"},"1513":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sammy","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a88c9668-823d-4431-8739-ebb157d865de.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"34702024-f844-4950-9385-04467d60b9ad.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"084de644-6329-4a2a-a6db-dfd71d30732f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ba1ca117-b8e6-4916-8dc3-188ebdb81fe6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d14218ec-cff8-4143-94ef-78947ad97c01.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b57d7792-3b9b-4be4-8333-e093fcb76fd6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"34414654-3674-41d1-818c-0637d20ab57e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"38537052-8334-493e-86c2-16ab2e0212ad.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a58ecd0b-9e95-4927-9832-deb523c687f1.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8f247ca1-10a0-4263-9c97-4da14606a3f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c37c6697-7475-427f-bec0-993ad450e40c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ce1c00d7-7f68-479d-a0fa-b8365e25b4ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9b3cf8ed-196a-4a32-bcc5-fd93095d0d2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Viewpoint","Overview":"Enter the world of Viewpoint, this stunning 3D diagonal-scrolling shooter, a visual masterpiece which allows you to play from a three-quarter perspective.

Players are depicted as humans wielding large shields rather than the \"paddles\" alone. The setting consists of various futuristic arenas; the game takes place in the first half of the 22nd century. The ball cannot leave the play area upon reaching the left or right edge of the screen, as those are also limited by walls, in addition to the typical upper and lower wall. Instead, there are single columns of targets located along both the side walls. Whenever the ball hits a target, it is eliminated and points are scored by the opponent of the targets' owner. In order to win a round, the player must direct the ball by deflecting it with his\/her shield so that all of his opponents' targets are eliminated while retaining at least one of his own targets. The duration of rounds is also limited by time; in the event that time expires before one of the sides manages to achieve victory, the side with the most targets left in play is declared the winner of the round; should this result in a draw (when both players have an equal amount of targets left), both sides are awarded a win.","Publisher":"Visco","ReleaseDate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"6468":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Yumekobo","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"82c83721-1461-4d18-9e15-9194263009b3.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"00b64ad9-3948-41f8-8cfd-80ee0252d4ce.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"4ad6918f-c896-4692-a805-3e1eed02b166.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cd8b718b-a0f9-468f-b66e-68bbda08ee3e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f4ebd01a-460e-416d-a3c9-358993d63f6d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b81b796-b2d3-4343-9285-020a87ac1aa6.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5a64ea91-9df1-4a4c-8e87-721db4903756.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"525d60b0-4700-4cf7-bf77-dd6c0eec3594.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8ad17960-9a98-4956-8527-08ca30af4681.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5584debb-2aea-4883-8651-a0d53777ece0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"507a4a7b-1efb-45b1-bce8-a1272dd1fab4.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c934487f-187d-4ac7-93ed-3abf5d771d80.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"69169427-db63-42b4-82ef-1c9368d6cd35.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a4885e86-0fd0-4bd1-8836-209902f18c39.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9323b228-cb75-4de3-8f41-3478e488713d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Blazing Star","Overview":"Sometime in their past, the planets Remuria and Mutras started an interplanetary war that showed no sign of ending.

In a week, the humans were assimilated by Brawshella.\nYet, once they were assimilated, they found no other purpose in life but to continue fighting each other. After a while, four of the assimilated fighter pilots regained their consciousness and remembered their pasts.

The challenger is a stout man in brown skin. The ground has been tainted with blood. However, his crescent blade hasn't touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it won't be long before heãwould fall. \"Fool, you will become one of my family\" resounded the opponent's voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand.\nThe Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggest. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.","Publisher":"SNK of America","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"6470":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble 2","Region":"Japan"},{"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble 2 \/ Bust-A-Move Again","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"f5cf55e3-4af0-4659-9121-1396f29618d0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"2a935f91-54f7-4beb-8199-ba267247e39e.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"deccf20d-67ac-4dd4-8c94-5d17f8b73fd8.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"b8b76993-388a-4ac5-aa88-f44c68347da4.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"4ceee4f9-7434-423b-b43a-32d84cf6f52c.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"be774907-216d-4ff8-b710-ee5a8b970741.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d5627bf9-9959-453b-8672-ce3b540a85a9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f29c79e-1344-424d-bc25-cd5e79084db8.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"63d477c0-9ff9-4124-b546-f6850252c73e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fb98a181-ea63-4b81-9931-cd63d47bbba4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bf51441d-b085-422c-b3e2-28f6ab9df1c6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0153fb5d-da03-45d9-9850-e99f639f3a65.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30b577de-0e0c-4daf-abfb-76b7b90b5683.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bust-A-Move Again","Overview":"Puzzle Bobble 2 is the first sequel to \"Puzzle Bobble\", It was entitled in Europe and North America as Bust-A-Move Again on the arcade and Bust-A-Move 2 on the home consoles.

Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay.\n\nIt is noted that a handful of members from Irem developed this title and later went on to create Metal Slug.\n\nThe game was later ported over for the Neo Geo CD system, in 1995. The CD featured improved voice acting and added a short introduction to the game explaining the plot.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"6474":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NG:DEV.TEAM","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b7544057-0e07-4553-af2b-12fc7c4d28ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fast Striker","Overview":"2D arcade shooting game with emphasis on scoring originally developed for NEOÂ·GEO.

For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player wins the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For Example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, Kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (Teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). It's slogan is \"We got the kick\".\n\nUnlike its arcade counter-part, the Neo Geo version tries to be more of a soccer simulation game. Differences include the Neo Geo version more slowed down, and more realism added in shooting, passing, etc.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neo_Geo_Cup_%2798:_The_Road_to_the_Victory"},"8673":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"78179664-6a8c-4d27-b388-e46915aba65c.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"e4b5d782-8c9c-4d66-a429-c5465ca26d76.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"e5e2897f-ea8e-4f74-a23b-279681d49cde.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"d805f770-73b0-4332-b3ae-8ed5d57b0c2b.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0d748623-c2c9-459a-9caa-1d17b6b6d4fb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"27bffb03-878f-4066-bb98-503e9731c29c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9fd66263-c969-4220-b2ba-c2f240868c5e.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"83b6310f-6a03-4524-9ebb-fa270b8a6a2a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bce16153-1ac3-4060-8703-dca9a63ef0ff.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"4ce778cd-ba0e-4045-9886-46fe1332dc9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f24f31c8-1db5-4c17-be19-d9f85320a0cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8d43f503-04da-4bff-9a50-992c05e3ff44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"King of the Monsters","Overview":"King of the Monsters is a two player (or one player vs. computer) fighting game, in which the players take control of two gargantuan monsters (like Godzillas) and battle it out in different city locations.\nThe city gets gradually destroyed as the two creatures fight it out.

One or two players can choose among 10 teams: France, Spain, U.S.A., Italy, Germany, Taiwan, United Kingdom, China, Japan and South Korea (in the European and Japanese versions. The U.S.A. version features local cities). The teams are rated in 1 to 9 points on four attributes (dunk, 3 point, speed and defense). Each game lasts two halves of 2 minutes each. The game ends if the player loses the first half, needing to spend a continue to play the second half.\n\nWhen on offense, the player can perform 2 or 3 point shots by pressing the A button. The B button is used to pass the ball. Pressing A and B together throws the ball high in the air, catching it meanwhile (by pressing A) causes the player to perform a dunk. When on defense, the player can jump and block by pressing A and cut off and steal by pressing B. A fantasy element is added to the game: a super shot meter is shown at the bottom of the screen for each team. As points are scored, the meter is filled. When the meter is full, the player can perform a super dunk by pressing A within the 3 points shot line, making the player jump 10 meters in the air.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1994-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"10036":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Alpha Mission II \/ ASO II - Last Guardian","Region":"World"},{"AlternateName":"ASO II: Last Guardian","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a9c9e242-3730-4de6-9a10-6f0e4022d0b4.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"ec923c3d-e7ae-4ce0-9a36-bc2bb7445976.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"1d595857-5b5f-4c60-9159-7ed96250fc2a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"80960405-2143-4cc5-bc0b-2a3637e78e55.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4e877035-57cb-4011-98a1-46c6dbef78e3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4cc5fc54-4e7b-4fe8-bf73-62c9788a71b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7957c53a-6992-40cf-8f58-5ae5e33bbda2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c9f0a4bd-0943-4a5e-b84d-d37631741849.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"414cb8d4-3343-485a-8098-33aeba1bfe47.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d50b87c5-7378-44c4-a88a-2b3ed9b54846.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"50fb3a76-d96c-49bb-8184-293885e01575.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ce513979-2a01-474b-a1c9-f9f03aa88553.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c72bc2d0-aa30-4ca6-946e-c744dca04a5d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ae4d79cc-7b61-4f15-867b-e151716bed45.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Alpha Mission II","Overview":"The lunar nightmare of a bloody 200-year space war was thought to be over in the \"original\" ALPHA MISSION.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"10051":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visco","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"0de95ba6-8cd9-4f84-8936-9ef470a5ab0f.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"461421d4-a615-4aff-805f-e8df94e7cba1.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"0f782f07-ce5c-4139-8fe3-256356c8fee7.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb26af57-679b-4bda-9881-8c8296f92f4a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b5c5677-9c8c-4e12-b71c-2a603a63497d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed84c81e-2531-47d2-ab4d-843294813c68.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"378abf3a-f1e8-4c6d-9c1d-842e46c03d54.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e93fcc49-7044-4feb-91fd-8865ac2b0766.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bd10ead2-b0fa-4f92-a006-eb4e65798fc5.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"62923c30-db2c-4a98-a13b-37c52b9db297.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Breakers Revenge","Overview":"Two years after the release of Breakers, Visco has come up with Breakers Revenge. This game is essentially the original Breakers with one new character, bringing the playable total to nine. This game, like Breakers, is a 2D side view fighting game. The two novel ideas from Breakers, having alternate names when characters fight their clones and having shadow images around a dizzy character, are also present in Breakers Revenge. But while they were mildly novel in the first game they barely merit a raised eyebrow in this.\n\nLike its predecessor, Breakers Revenge plays like a standard Capcom inspired 2D fighting game. Characters have access to a variety of standard and special attacks, as well as combos, guard breakers, and taunts. Each time the character attacks his or her super meter is charged up, to a maximum of three levels. Whenever the super meter has at least one level charged the character can use his or her super attacks, which drain one level of the meter in the process. If the meter is allowed to charge up to the maximum three levels without being used all of the character's attacks become more powerful.","Publisher":"JoshProd","ReleaseDate":"1998-07-02T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"10052":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visco","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"36b2361a-a261-44f2-987c-26491961b4c7.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"f664eb8d-ea40-441c-8128-3c4ef935ee8b.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"9ee28374-9e3c-42ba-8a8b-52829dfb6907.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc9b5470-0bfa-4745-be1b-97a663b65e87.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97fc6e2f-936a-40cf-853a-80790715db54.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6ae9e139-a02c-45f8-aa3f-3ee34cbea611.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4aaabb27-ed83-4382-b3b6-70a0217a179e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a55024d5-0529-4408-81a5-059290910235.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0fc13e43-ce6a-43a0-af76-5ac715a3a9c2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7ee885c-e7a0-4bca-ad6b-6115fd7388d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Captain Tomaday","Overview":"On a dark and stormy night, a mad botanist is doing a bit of research in his laboratory, when a tomato plant near some chemicals drops a tomato into a beaker.

Attacking with one fist for a while makes the other grow in size and power, eventually turning Tomadayâs other first into a 1-ton weight which does more damage than the usual fist.

The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. \n\nThe action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"10059":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Visco Games","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0a0edee0-8a84-4b40-88c2-0fbf7be01290.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"d3f36c6f-024d-4fed-be1a-fdd3ec4fe5a0.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"f84d35ac-e0de-455d-8eb5-aa76a7eec0df.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"69480c49-6588-409d-a269-799e3778acbe.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9557b7ce-0392-48b6-b086-08ffb651a244.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fec7196a-3e78-409b-9c85-d6eb1f156f1c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"be0ae426-4c2e-4f4b-8b2b-a86c84d52812.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Goal!

During boxing matches each boxer has three health bars on screen, with the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second. When a boxer's health bar is drained he gets knocked down, but can get back up. When the third health bar is drained that boxer is knocked out and loses the match.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1991-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legend_of_Success_Joe"},"10067":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Noise Factory","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"85c623e4-0c54-4a71-b9a5-c2509bce46df.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"e31d7399-5a1f-4040-a082-1dc03fd4ab89.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"f422e863-cf2c-467b-b1ce-97bd2dbc13a4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4d3d43f0-825e-4942-969a-9a40d35f581d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"70df1d87-a959-42d0-ac75-f8b684361c49.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"293d21a9-fc53-4c0d-a87c-bed3b7ed7f9d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b2e0130-068b-48e1-b315-4969929f5fe9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"89694574-6666-4d04-9bb7-160cc8199dcf.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9d555419-571c-444b-9995-6d3a0cd8789a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7184280b-75b5-41e1-a3bb-3911d10e5e73.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f620af23-c952-48f9-a6e8-9e31d318971d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7fe96e80-4fb8-4ea2-986d-d27f1f9608f8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Power Instinct Matrimelee","Overview":"The king of certain country wants to find a worthy successor for the throne and the ideal husband for his little daughter (or a beautiful and strong woman for his older son). So he holds a fighting tournament where the prize is the hand of the princess and the throne succession.\n\nPower Instinct: Matrimelee is a sequel to the obscure and lesser known Power Instinct series. The characters of Matrimelee range from incredibly strange (including two hobbit-granny sprite clones & a furry) to the I've-seen-you-somewhere-before stereotypes (complete with a cut & paste ninja, a generic native American, and your basic karate guy). Several characters from Rage of The Dragons also make a cross-over to the game.\n\nIn  Matrimelee, the staple super combo gauge is replaced with the \"Stress Gauge\". Unlike most combo gauges, the Street Gauge doesn't fill when players connect with attacks. Instead it fills when attacks are blocked and when damage is taken. This is to simulate the \"stress\" of not having your moves land, and\/or the stress one may feel when punched in the face.  When the Stress Gauge fills up, a super combo can be performed. Characters also become invulnerable to attacks and will also interrupt combos.\n\nIn some stages, a referee will be standing in the background. Players can actually call him into the foreground and use him to attack their enemies... either sending the ref flying into the opponent, or using him as a human shield for opponent's projectiles.  A \"Bloodline Battle\" can also be initiated if two players taunt one after the other. When a Bloodline Battle begins, both characters move to the middle of the screen. Between them lowers a television screen which randomly shows different buttons (A,B,C,D). Which ever player hits the buttons first, their character will gain a free attack on the opponent.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"10276":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Operation Ragnarok","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NMK","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b09b3758-f594-4151-9e3f-1a405f2cd416.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"221f34c8-e85b-4458-8f29-4cc983127150.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"03b26ef4-4347-46ab-8894-3f4b95c205f0.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"d0c1ff19-89aa-45be-ba8e-f429afc22b2e.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9e8f897a-02f5-4e47-910c-ce5a7539952c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3f835a44-7769-42dd-9cff-e9ef5f866560.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0e8f323a-8881-4975-bf2d-1b273c995fe3.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c50e0ae5-0d2c-41cb-89e2-2ace91d23963.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2bdab2f7-7a78-4a86-9f9e-af5b38ed850e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"672de6d1-718c-44bf-8ea8-790e8a625baa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"52e14c30-68f9-4cec-b1ab-7b3ead222f9f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0033489d-5149-445a-9b6d-cc584215a0b8.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Zed Blade","Overview":"Zed Blade is a side-scrolling shooter with a sci-fi theme.

And rumor has it that only one who collects 12 gems, each with a sign of the zodiac, along with a gem with a Solar Symbol on it, is worthy of the job. Now that opportunity has knocked, will our hero be able to answer and recover the 12 gems from their multiple-colored hiding places?\n\nBased on the Puzzle Bobble series, Puzzle de Pon! pits a single player against a series of tricky puzzlers. The player's objective in each of them is to free a gem from a location buried deep inside the playing field. To do this, the player must aim a colored bubble and have it hit those of the same color. Depending on the player's aim, the bubbles can either fly straight up or ricochet off a wall. When three or more of the same color match, they pop. Once a gem is free, it's on to the next puzzle. If the screen gets filled to the brim with bubbles, or if time runs out, it's Game Over.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"10464":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Shin-Oh-Ken","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"System Vision","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"12c9b1aa-eef4-461c-9819-9ec74785ee53.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"4ea8a858-6681-4d86-b6ae-87f05fe96045.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"15fb7541-6fd4-4edf-b3a9-7654494ee18c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"38bcbe15-c7a0-4592-96e8-652cbc9216b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c20a4d79-0f8f-4cbf-9dbd-74a738dd8f20.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e260257c-100d-498e-bfa2-bf7d1d6841d7.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f7077b60-a4e2-4ea9-96e2-54e86a8af06a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9ea24389-cd50-4c6f-b346-39129fd2fa9c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ragnagard","Overview":"2 Player fighting game similar to Killer Instinct graphically.

The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.\n\nReal Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"10466":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers \/ Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2: The Newcomers","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"bb63ef1c-7fe9-4ad1-9cd7-4671e785154e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e17898b1-a0e6-4363-a446-477756cc4e25.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ed1a2b2c-6b7d-40bb-a687-0928694520da.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"83405fea-9de8-49b7-8ef0-03befbeeafac.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9dd53aa6-1f85-47f5-8408-80cd1c4d25f9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"02f404b6-8566-4200-bf5e-1a5dd7ee8e7b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"74031a1f-480a-4719-9994-504a40e529b6.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"c4ce15d5-cbed-4f73-97e2-f2e3162c36bd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"855759fd-72c9-49de-8f78-5a5a213f8fa0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"177f852b-d4c1-42aa-8c21-11e731c7254b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers","Overview":"The Newcomers...

The first four stages are in random order, while the last four are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique \"supershot\" which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.\n\nAfter the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II.

In terms of weapons-based fighters, thereâs no comparing this game with the brilliant 3D visuals and the fluid offensive-and-defensive gameplay of last yearâs Soul Caliber III, they are of different decades. The original Samurai Shodown came to market the same year as the first Mortal Kombat, and though it offered no âfinishing movesâ, the screen was frequently painted red with the arterial spray of blood from the losing character. \n\nIn this fifth iteration of Samurai Shodown, however, some of that intensity, and blood, isnât as prevalent. There are a total of 26 characters to choose from, and the series best are represented --  Haohmaru, Hanzo, Jubei, Genjuro, Nakaruru (and her bird). Of course, it wouldnât be an SNK title if there werenât some truly bizarre characters as well. Kusaregedo, an oversized mutant with a purple vomit attack, would be a more appropriate character for Ghost Hunter. And true-to-form, the story mode ultimately pits you against âGaohâ an overlord who has (wait for itâ¦) demon-transformation powers.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P8Oeqpqlx9w","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samurai_Shodown_V"},"10472":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Sengoku Denshou 2001","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Noise Factory","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1d0de1c4-18e8-48ed-9cf1-5a17d125696f.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"64dfb50b-b2c4-4d20-8792-7cb2c73ae7f3.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"33d45b44-fe75-4efc-98ba-3719fd41c4dc.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"e9a1f905-9abf-4b04-8f8f-a8c37438b0e8.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"475ee148-2385-4fdf-88be-3b5629dfd089.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2ccdbe31-b7aa-44d3-b9b1-b0a15d6386e7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eb499b26-4813-4ae8-bb58-4564d64d3e1f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4787ab3c-6c3c-4eb7-907d-9e299711fab5.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"adc5c4e0-1129-48e0-bf1d-4a0a7a73bbda.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eff21f4b-70c9-4ef5-8aef-9f297f191552.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eaf91933-197b-4b80-85f2-f080e047c325.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6c903075-243d-49cf-9440-7b1102a5a196.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7f9f498d-15b8-4d0f-b88d-fa507180c3b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sengoku 3","Overview":"The third game in the Sengoku series of beat 'em ups, Sengoku 3 once again pits you and a friend against the undead forces of Nobunaga, however this time you can freely select from a group of different characters each with their own weapons and abilities, as well as choose which location in the world (or level) to tackle whenever you want.\n\nThe game incorporates a more complex fighting system similar to a one-on-one fighting game, by giving players different attack buttons, special moves based on directional inputs, combos and even a super bar used to unleash devastating super moves.

Its character designs are almost identical to the ones in Data East's Sega Genesis game titled Dashin' Desperadoes; however, the rest of both games are completely different. Also, Spinmaster's gameplay, artwork style, animations of some characters and the styles of its weapons were heavily inspired by another arcade game by Data East titled Joe & Mac, according to the Japanese Miracle Adventure arcade flyer.\n\nSpin Master is the story of an intrepid adventurer whose girlfriend and treasure map has been stolen. Taking on the role of the adventurer armed with a yo-yo, you must the recover pieces of your treasure map and try to find your girlfriend. By recovering all the pieces of the map, you can uncover clues to the treasure's location, giving you a chance to guess where the treasure is. \n\nAlong the way you uncover treasure chests that can contain special weapons like boxing gloves, bombs or ice shots. Each weapon has its own distinct range, firing trajectory and damage potential. Some weapons can cause opponents to bounce across the screen, doing damage to any other enemies in their path. You can charge up your weapons to do more damage or to have a wider spread pattern, depending on the weapon you're currently equipped with.

Pressing the A button repeatedly keeps the horse accelerated with a slight drain of the stamina bar, while pressing the B button applies the rider crop to the horse. This results in a slight burst of speed at the cost of draining the horse's stamina bar faster.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"10481":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Images":[{"FileName":"8b1ba848-678b-4423-b864-e37e149ae475.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"0bc69029-21e1-464e-afcc-b6acc4633857.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"c384ea4d-14bc-4143-95e2-c7110a73fd5d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61fdc941-32a5-47d9-8925-bbbd27dc4a28.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ebf0baf-0bbe-4093-ad4b-335ce176ed42.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"065f7817-e09f-4c51-b2e5-cead9e4ba0ba.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"77e84c0a-b0cf-480b-8919-b8979edf3508.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Super Spy","Overview":"You are a secret agent sent to infiltrate and enemy base and take out their leader.

However, the game does not use the Team Battle format, but follows the traditional round-based one-on-one format. Each match begins with a dialogue exchange between the player's character and the opponent. One new technique introduced in the game is the Front Grand Step, which allows the player to leap towards the opponent and cancel into a basic attack. The player can perform this technique while guarding from an opponent's attack, which will consume one Power Gauge level.\nThe game uses a different type of Power Gauge known as the Groove Power Gauge System, which has three levels. The Groove gauge fills as the player lands attacks against the opponents or guard attacks. When the gauge fills to Lv. 1 or Lv. 2, the player can perform Super Special Moves, a Guard Cancel Attack or a Guard Cancel Front Step maneuver. When the gauge is full, its reaches MAXIMUM level and a MAX Activation occurs. During MAX Activation, the gauge will change into a timer and the player gains the ability to cancel any of their moves anytime (in addition to Super Special Moves and Guard Cancels). Once the timer runs out, the gauge returns to Lv. 2.\nIn addition to the regular Super Special Move, each character also has an Exceed move which can only be performed once when the player's life is less than half.","Publisher":"Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2003-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bQnd4Cw4oMU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SNK_vs._Capcom:_SVC_Chaos"},"10483":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"090a391e-303c-4627-8b1a-78ea0a7d52be.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"b2819f6c-8a32-4c89-8231-3616969969ea.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"edf222e9-5204-4356-a7d9-ac2cc260689d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7d629bec-fbf1-44f6-b2cd-8a4f3bca4fc3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f688f771-8141-4df6-82cc-5961b6fdb96d.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9986550f-3c3a-40b6-96e6-abbc58d7de78.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5fa5ee4e-c74e-4c70-bdd6-1d313de2566d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy","Overview":"Clean up the Space Pirates!

Lo and behold, Data East had the audacity to make a sequel a year after the release of the original, even after Capcom tried to sue them for ripping off SF2.\n\nFighter's History Dynamite (also known as Karnov's Revenge) is at least an improvement over the original. The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie & Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn't changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay.\n\nWhile playing Karnov's Revenge, there's just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn't offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre.

It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic.\n\nThe sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that. \n\nThe announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the \"fun.\" \n\nAt first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do.","Publisher":"SNK Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9E-201c6Vv8"},"19594":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Saurus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"7dd8669a-1e30-4938-8af4-a953beeeddeb.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"29910683-05f9-410a-9152-8657b00bde0b.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"5630f754-1860-4c4c-a320-8b7c4a04465f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"676df5e9-e6fb-4a75-a9bb-44e77362e037.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b2aaa3fc-4670-4d8f-83cc-4c9c06792459.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9d8e7712-e37f-44b1-a4a6-c4a8f39075bf.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Shock Troopers: 1st Squad","Overview":"Shock Troopers is a 1-2 player game where players select one of eight characters to play as.

Boulder Dash was released on several game & computer systems, and was well received. The games main objective is to collect all the gems hidden throughout the playfield while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The Neo-Geo version also steals many sprites & sounds from Face's Gururin (an officially released game in 1994), hence why rumors abounded in the beginning that it might be a long lost official proto. This was proven to be false. However, the game can be readily found for $100 - $200, so for those who may have fond memories of the gameplay and\/or wish to add it to their library of games, they can obtain it rather easily. Others may want to pass. It does not appear to be \"finished\" and may not even have an ending but maybe someday a more complete revision will surface.","Publisher":"Homebrew","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed"},"35110":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble \/ Bust-A-Move","Region":"World"},{"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"11282686-59c2-466c-9a1e-aa8a009edfb8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"5b77df48-3f33-404d-8026-628b25bba439.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet"},{"FileName":"e3528725-1888-489d-97fd-ff40584327dc.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"0ea1d18a-9386-495d-b1d8-036aa9ded69d.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"4a8f767a-cbd8-46bb-9150-5590269aa310.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"39f1c50f-213e-4da8-8c64-64b227f80ec6.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee"},{"FileName":"f6226b47-d8e7-493f-b328-88751557ee61.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08653fb6-0b89-4f02-bfb9-c562232c03d8.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26f8af06-9999-4a3c-94e4-f94fd78a4099.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fb9b27bb-37a4-4739-9c6a-0280ed8fe20e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a522942f-c2a1-4bb1-826a-d3f0f74e9372.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"95924e3e-e480-4777-8139-9a63744dbdad.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5741e9cc-b4b7-4d36-a966-2e540309af36.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bust-A-Move","Overview":"Bust-a-Move, also known as Puzzle Bobble in Japan, is a 1994 tile-matching arcade puzzle video game for one or two players created by Taito Corporation.
