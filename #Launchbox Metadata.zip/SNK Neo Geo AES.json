One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player continues or a second player is still active and vice-versa.

When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK Corporation","Publisher":"SNK of America","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"358267b9-e7a3-4a6b-85a3-110757440d0a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"d2a77ec8-2bd9-45bc-b0b2-d323fc1a6b10.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"0278ff74-b194-48b1-b825-ddc655b1151b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"17054a11-7cfa-4f31-b7a0-81034f8cce4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"b4175e9b-d34c-44a6-ad55-ae4390810cbe.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"6222891e-7ab2-453d-883f-722547ed38df.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"6b719eb5-ddd9-437a-9078-d6cb1f669e39.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"91b5001d-870a-4dc3-b116-eed27b723b72.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"39ca8488-faa3-4876-b4fa-a67bb2de1f2b.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"1eb4be03-031d-41e5-a18f-3706e2745558.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"db4e18a6-f020-4c99-bf2a-ff7e006d8e63.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"820321cb-98da-407a-b38a-7ed8e13a52ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"249b01b5-237c-401b-a4fb-ece9ec39d33a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18829,"FileName":"27863b64-4346-4aa4-bdbb-bcc175b4b519.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18829,"AlternateName":"Ryuuko no Ken","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":1334,"Name":"Art of Fighting 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original Fatal Fury, we learn that Mr. Karate, the final boss of the original game, behind the mask, is really Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father, that Takuma was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"9ad87539-86a4-4413-8155-d7c4de1df596.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"41b00127-40fa-4afc-b7bc-5c8a751e79c7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"a7360270-e602-43e6-818d-55d5e7d10d14.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"127d5737-9f18-48ec-8d0c-034d1b7b4142.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"a644a56e-0872-4f48-ab2b-f3ddf7fce408.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"ac6b2138-4d9f-4338-a835-fedbc3dcc693.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"f44c868c-84d9-49b9-94ba-93e3a37c2938.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"540e9aaf-2be3-4381-9ac7-4d3dc32dbeb2.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"d69166cf-f040-40d8-913b-71040116c062.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"49f63462-97a1-43bd-bd61-8e754042f06a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"f4f20cd5-d431-4faa-97f3-fbd134b2a0a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"a57cfe30-6e11-4e4d-a921-898fabe436f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"8d2259f7-931e-411b-93a2-cd8cca900468.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"96a77d98-37c6-416e-94b7-068bafa46ebe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1334,"FileName":"a09e38e9-a3e4-424f-8088-30b4d2240816.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6465,"Name":"Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this third and final entry in the Art of Fighting series, the story shifts from Ryo Sakazaki to his best friend and rival, Robert Garcia, as he ventures into Mexico to try and locate Freia Lawrence, a childhood friend, who asked for his help.

Instead, there are single columns of targets located along both the side walls. Whenever the ball hits a target, it is eliminated and points are scored by the opponent of the targets' owner. In order to win a round, the player must direct the ball by deflecting it with his/her shield so that all of his opponents' targets are eliminated while retaining at least one of his own targets. The duration of rounds is also limited by time; in the event that time expires before one of the sides manages to achieve victory, the side with the most targets left in play is declared the winner of the round; should this result in a draw (when both players have an equal amount of targets left), both sides are awarded a win.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Visco","Publisher":"Visco","ReleaseDate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"6cc6ef5e-91b3-40f8-9c9a-78e676ace9e5.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"7e9a4415-7b36-43cf-99bc-8858e9cd5490.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"65a23c1f-70b1-42b2-9b08-51ba3fc86c18.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"1402bc2f-a659-41bf-909f-f10c30746047.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"86b737d1-03a2-43d9-aaad-2098897806ae.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"2b6dca38-5568-4b41-80c2-d6544b0738ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"3c0759b7-a354-4ad8-8548-ca5ac0cf8ec1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"237f72bf-bc8c-457b-97af-b5308b63dd72.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"9c5e3132-1894-4109-ae33-8e8350265f15.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"228a6583-f613-40a4-8413-9d3617950ace.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"52f288aa-5a74-4fbd-b6d6-e9a5bf4c57c4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"a108ee66-ed9d-485c-9e2a-df070f3ce13c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":6467,"FileName":"dc48d7b8-e253-4c61-8e72-57fb685a95dc.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":6468,"Name":"Blazing Star","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sometime in their past, the planets Remuria and Mutras started an interplanetary war that showed no sign of ending. The endless fight between the human-like inhabitants of the two planets had gone so long that weapon development moved into dangerous territory: Organic Weapon Production combined with alien technology. Soon, a sentient weapon - Brawshella - was born. Brawshella gathered all animal life on both planets and forced them to do its bidding and attack the humans. In a week, the humans were assimilated by Brawshella.\nYet, once they were assimilated, they found no other purpose in life but to continue fighting each other. After a while, four of the assimilated fighter pilots regained their consciousness and remembered their pasts. Upon discovering their humanity, the pilots were conflicted with following Brawshella's orders or fighting it to fully regain their independence.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"ADK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"98db70e1-7e10-49d3-8fae-571bebd1990f.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"be70b876-f4f4-4f9c-bc19-dd61ff2edaa2.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"670238bb-d5dd-4e42-a7e5-be08033407a7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"628e0d17-6324-4c39-b684-c037a6f959cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"2b98610a-d211-46d3-8f4e-a5e6063d9bf9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"791f6761-1051-47c1-ac11-d3c97a4c07f2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"509f6306-285e-40d9-bfa7-ec5b463e8367.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"5f4fd1c2-25a3-4950-a5ff-f0a3cf465344.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"f76a1ab5-b363-466e-a351-37bf7e48119b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10050,"FileName":"a7a9727d-7ed4-4df4-a171-9777cfd40388.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10050,"AlternateName":"Raguy","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10050,"AlternateName":"Blue's Journey","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":10456,"Name":"Bomberman: Panic Bomber","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It is a \"falling blocks\" puzzle game based on the Bomberman franchise.

Each time the character attacks his or her super meter is charged up, to a maximum of three levels. Whenever the super meter has at least one level charged the character can use his or her super attacks, which drain one level of the meter in the process.

The tomato then runs off to stop the forces of evil eggplant aliens, under the name Captain Tomaday!\n\nThe titular tomato must traverse five levels that have baddies coming in all sorts of waves. However, what sets Captain Tomaday apart from most shooters is its method of attacking. The A button makes Tomaday’s left fist shoot, and the B button makes his right fist shoot. Both fists can be fired simultaneously or one at a time. Attacking with one fist for a while makes the other grow in size and power, eventually turning Tomaday’s other first into a 1-ton weight which does more damage than the usual fist. Tomaday’s fists return to him as soon as they hit something, and this creates a risk vs. reward factor in taking risks and getting close to an enemy to take them out quicker versus taking them out from a distance even if it will take longer.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Visco","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1999-05-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"f664eb8d-ea40-441c-8128-3c4ef935ee8b.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"36b2361a-a261-44f2-987c-26491961b4c7.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"49555aba-59fe-42fe-a283-2f17fbc16ba0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"9ee28374-9e3c-42ba-8a8b-52829dfb6907.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"dc9b5470-0bfa-4745-be1b-97a663b65e87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"97fc6e2f-936a-40cf-853a-80790715db54.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"5c239614-0943-4d7a-aa0c-840f2e56ef80.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"6ae9e139-a02c-45f8-aa3f-3ee34cbea611.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"4aaabb27-ed83-4382-b3b6-70a0217a179e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"0fc13e43-ce6a-43a0-af76-5ac715a3a9c2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"a55024d5-0529-4408-81a5-059290910235.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":10052,"FileName":"c7ee885c-e7a0-4bca-ad6b-6115fd7388d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18954,"Name":"Chibi Maruko-chan: Deluxe Quiz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Based on the classic manga Chibi Maruko-chan, the player controls Maruko and two of her friends or family members to win a trivia game show.

It holds the honor of being the first RELEASED homebrew game for the Neo-Geo system. It is CLEARLY a clone of the game Boulder Dash released back in 1984 by First Star Software. Boulder Dash was released on several game & computer systems, and was well received. The games main objective is to collect all the gems hidden throughout the playfield while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The Neo-Geo version also steals many sprites & sounds from Face's Gururin (an officially released game in 1994), hence why rumors abounded in the beginning that it might be a long lost official proto. This was proven to be false.

Players fight primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or \"oversway\" into either of the sway lines at the background or foreground . Attacks between planes have returned but are now called \"Oversway Attacks\" and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special & super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round.\n\nAlong with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they'll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both.

The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie & Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn't changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay.\n\nWhile playing Karnov's Revenge, there's just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn't offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre.

If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. \n\nThe action is fast-paced and smooth.

Not many of the real rules of football apply here either, such as the offside rule and you don't even seem to get penalized for fouling people","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Visco Games","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"0a0edee0-8a84-4b40-88c2-0fbf7be01290.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"d3f36c6f-024d-4fed-be1a-fdd3ec4fe5a0.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"f84d35ac-e0de-455d-8eb5-aa76a7eec0df.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"69480c49-6588-409d-a269-799e3778acbe.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"9557b7ce-0392-48b6-b086-08ffb651a244.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"fec7196a-3e78-409b-9c85-d6eb1f156f1c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10059,"FileName":"be0ae426-4c2e-4f4b-8b2b-a86c84d52812.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10060,"Name":"Gururin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gururin is a puzzle game with a twist, literally. Most puzzle games of this type involve trying to rearrange things that are falling out of the sky to try and get rid of them. Usually you do that by moving and rotating the pieces as they fall. So one day someone decided why not make a puzzle game where the board rotates instead of the pieces?\n\nAnd Gururin is just that. The game drops odd-looking little people down from the top of the screen three at a time. Players must match characters in horizontal or vertical rows of three or more to make them disappear off the screen. To accomplish this players can rotate the board left or right before the pieces start their drop. Players can also move the pieces left or right during their descent to the bottom of the game board.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Minato Giken/FACE","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1994-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"2a8d7cb7-710a-4919-b2cb-8f8ccbbaab6f.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"36fe0ae6-5d93-4306-8001-576e70848f3b.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"5b7933f3-b42d-46a6-8ba0-b47877209e15.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"e9cee12a-8383-4765-b763-93e8e3492eed.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"66c885a0-97ce-48c1-ac3c-18b933b857e5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"def81a10-4434-41ac-aac4-b5459000a281.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"29301078-fcd3-4ff6-bf10-4aff1e09bb06.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"9d579272-028c-4b4b-b73e-37238a25ee28.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"7cd5eaac-60a0-4334-9690-f2a9b1be2a98.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"c85a08c4-efd8-4494-8753-f15b7c4cc1a8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"889a7e05-0fc7-44a7-9866-01e4b1419876.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":10060,"FileName":"a2576d79-36cb-49c7-afba-4c1ee57f9b66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20885,"Name":"Jockey Grand Prix","ReleaseYear":"2014","Overview":"This game was released around 2001 and is basically a horse race betting game.

Again, the game can be set to \"pay out\" to either an installed coin hopper, or through a \"credit\" re-imbursement system set-up by the location or the operator.

With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily. \n\nThe attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high-ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army's intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever. \n\nMeanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile. \n\nThe announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named \"Resistants\" are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat-ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter-offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks. \n\nSeeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion. \n\nThe player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and \"Metal Slug\" tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.\nThe protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.\n\nDuring the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.\nThere are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsMWIbnKrqk","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Nazca Corporation","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-05-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"cc086f90-18c9-45c5-a559-341bda804cc2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"5377043f-df65-436f-b24a-1fabf1e50156.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"c1277af6-883a-4560-b323-3fc1ce5dde07.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"6dd8f455-eb99-4bc5-83c9-b2e9dda3a35c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"cbac6566-5fb0-4ad1-8103-a72531a0a9dd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"96afd301-b45a-4860-9b19-944444c393d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"47be588d-3a91-403e-9d6a-d03fc2e177f8.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"30fd62b2-fe48-46fd-b716-00ec2b679164.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"ec77df0b-c26d-4433-a196-8b1d1ec23d01.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":222,"FileName":"440a2e17-a236-41ed-a9b3-134939b4ad6d.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":24620,"Name":"Minasan no Okagesama Desu!

It features 73 teams countries. Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player wins the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For Example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, Kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (Teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). It's slogan is \"We got the kick\".\n\nUnlike its arcade counter-part, the Neo Geo version tries to be more of a soccer simulation game. Differences include the Neo Geo version more slowed down, and more realism added in shooting, passing, etc.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-03T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"80ac5646-d5e2-4ecf-b3a8-fe38cb3fecb0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"d573a422-0a72-4838-bc10-02ec225454f2.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"19711e45-33c8-4623-815a-046175b07ea8.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"e45a4b7f-0077-4409-856d-d94b5df86293.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"e443e545-b51b-46ee-b6a7-80372dc74a70.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"b8eccbb7-a93c-431d-9d15-591fb0ef61d8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"33240a87-8b89-4af8-a356-60ff174d9ad9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"d11524ab-0c17-429f-975c-f86713300e4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8505,"FileName":"e34e6a6a-782c-48da-93c3-ab2f69cbbcb0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10453,"Name":"Neo Mr. Do!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Neo Mr. Do! is the Neo Geo adaptation of the 1982 arcade game Mr. Do!.

There are small and large orange circular faces scattered throughout the boards. By tunneling under them and removing their supports Mr. Do can cause them to fall and break, exposing power-up items that can enhance Mr. Do in a variety of ways.

The characters of Matrimelee range from incredibly strange (including two hobbit-granny sprite clones & a furry) to the I've-seen-you-somewhere-before stereotypes (complete with a cut & paste ninja, a generic native American, and your basic karate guy). Several characters from Rage of The Dragons also make a cross-over to the game.\n\nIn  Matrimelee, the staple super combo gauge is replaced with the \"Stress Gauge\". Unlike most combo gauges, the Street Gauge doesn't fill when players connect with attacks. Instead it fills when attacks are blocked and when damage is taken. This is to simulate the \"stress\" of not having your moves land, and/or the stress one may feel when punched in the face.  When the Stress Gauge fills up, a super combo can be performed. Characters also become invulnerable to attacks and will also interrupt combos.\n\nIn some stages, a referee will be standing in the background. Players can actually call him into the foreground and use him to attack their enemies... either sending the ref flying into the opponent, or using him as a human shield for opponent's projectiles.  A \"Bloodline Battle\" can also be initiated if two players taunt one after the other. When a Bloodline Battle begins, both characters move to the middle of the screen. Between them lowers a television screen which randomly shows different buttons (A,B,C,D). Which ever player hits the buttons first, their character will gain a free attack on the opponent.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Noise Factory","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2002-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"85c623e4-0c54-4a71-b9a5-c2509bce46df.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"e31d7399-5a1f-4040-a082-1dc03fd4ab89.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"f422e863-cf2c-467b-b1ce-97bd2dbc13a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"4d3d43f0-825e-4942-969a-9a40d35f581d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"70df1d87-a959-42d0-ac75-f8b684361c49.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"293d21a9-fc53-4c0d-a87c-bed3b7ed7f9d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"9b2e0130-068b-48e1-b315-4969929f5fe9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"89694574-6666-4d04-9bb7-160cc8199dcf.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"9d555419-571c-444b-9995-6d3a0cd8789a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"7184280b-75b5-41e1-a3bb-3911d10e5e73.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"f620af23-c952-48f9-a6e8-9e31d318971d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10067,"FileName":"7fe96e80-4fb8-4ea2-986d-d27f1f9608f8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10461,"Name":"Power Spikes II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Power Spikes II is a 2D side-view volleyball game that presents players with three different leagues.

The battle between the humans and aliens spread throughout the Solar System; within two years of combat Neptune was disintegrated, Jupiter was turned into a star and more than half of Earth's continents sank from rising ocean levels and the planet's changing axis as a result. \n\nKaoru Yamazaki, lone fighter pilot of the Dino-246, is one of the few survivors left of the Pulstar attack force founded to save the Solar System from the alien invaders; it is through her that mankind may have a chance to survive the alien menace.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58uNBJ1Wrs0","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Aicom","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"b90f16b4-3441-4490-b7ae-757f7bed6167.png","Type":"Arcade - Cabinet","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"6f357d4a-5bd6-4812-a812-06d2db02c77a.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"6ac5b47e-4f21-4061-81de-f754be810c4a.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"47e1d2d8-9b6a-496c-9569-f1a0b3eea966.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"84944585-ff1f-4a0e-bb16-012fa7a8a456.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"31ee26ac-20a1-4464-aa85-daffece445c8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"72222ae7-df9e-4078-9d9b-0b4d9f994eea.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"685d2aec-deb4-48c5-9558-048ba5e07fbe.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"9f5a1ac9-0b58-49ca-a1a6-def851241c37.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"5f9638c3-98ee-4344-81a5-08b0070253b1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"fbcb4191-6041-47e3-a588-e23e7d39265b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"5e00d29f-5129-429a-a42b-be5788cb4f0f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"fcb1dafb-e612-454d-8902-4a91c16879de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"faea0729-27f0-4d25-9e8b-295f52954923.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"140cd0f3-18a5-4e35-a6a1-d1d333fa33bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":8675,"FileName":"3c2ae011-2179-4dd0-997a-c559ceabf07c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10463,"Name":"Puzzle De Pon!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This is the true story of a lowly neophyte who dreamed of becoming somebody someday.

And rumor has it that only one who collects 12 gems, each with a sign of the zodiac, along with a gem with a Solar Symbol on it, is worthy of the job. Now that opportunity has knocked, will our hero be able to answer and recover the 12 gems from their multiple-colored hiding places?\n\nBased on the Puzzle Bobble series, Puzzle de Pon! pits a single player against a series of tricky puzzlers. The player's objective in each of them is to free a gem from a location buried deep inside the playing field. To do this, the player must aim a colored bubble and have it hit those of the same color. Depending on the player's aim, the bubbles can either fly straight up or ricochet off a wall. When three or more of the same color match, they pop. Once a gem is free, it's on to the next puzzle. If the screen gets filled to the brim with bubbles, or if time runs out, it's Game Over.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Visco Games","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"6fe220af-8abe-4f51-8021-e75be3ecb54e.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"f338f8d2-7144-4a43-b1c6-25942d72c4f6.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"934b4b9b-d93c-4137-89a3-d59babba13e6.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"f04f962f-8543-48a0-864e-95e7822bf788.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"5ed8971a-5695-4907-91a0-a544362d187c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"0240d172-f862-434b-9488-a7390a647c88.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"5a78991b-7712-4c02-9010-85a2d38b7586.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"a6401799-01ec-4c6a-bf73-57ccae2e2eba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10463,"FileName":"47130e61-fb39-4e06-ab12-e1415709abd5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10462,"Name":"Puzzle de Pon!

A dedicated button is now used to make an \"oversway\" (or change plane) towards the background or foreground.\n\nReal Bout introduces a Power Gauge, which fills up as the player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.\n\nReal Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-01-26T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"69d158f4-7226-47d0-81f1-7831d426e487.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"f564307a-8f52-4e61-bda5-79e60464a2f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"f53c54f3-c754-42ff-b1bb-fa3a66e07cf2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"a2e74425-8142-452e-b09c-50f536c3c9de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"4be602c2-027d-4ecf-b70d-ba814becf358.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"7f787819-c78b-48f0-b061-70eeae76a76d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"5a041a53-9629-4640-b0aa-c39f730f9b05.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"ba58b70d-119d-4378-8c6d-f2a983f0c5c8.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10465,"FileName":"7c608c80-0d18-4d13-a2c5-55efd8c9773f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10465,"AlternateName":"Real Bout Garou Densetsu","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":10466,"Name":"Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Newcomers...

The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taRsbUOdfvI","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"64a92805-c065-42e4-9cfa-cf964f3d9038.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"d94baa63-096b-44d7-b8a0-a0d73b79563d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"7f0f627f-1d7b-44ac-9100-58f43ba2ea3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"34bb9e78-69d2-4f08-9024-d9f0a85b4823.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"f8211329-1757-47ef-8826-09d07a922341.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"84706a84-c0e2-408a-b5ba-a23ac58cf347.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"c8095a18-c35e-48c9-a4e2-44c774a83d03.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"615505a2-066c-47d7-8d8a-9903f237c22b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"3d868ade-08df-4fa3-8c67-1ffb97fce53a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1504,"FileName":"03b1d4ca-129e-484d-8444-91bd8795357e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":1504,"AlternateName":"Samurai Spirits: Zankurou Musouken","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":1504,"AlternateName":"Fighters Swords","Region":"World"}]},{"DatabaseID":985,"Name":"Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa's Revenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Bringing a new breath to SNK's swordsman fighting series, this 4th installment marks the return of 3 classic characters (Yagyu Jubei, Charlotte and Tam Tam, now with updated stuff), introduces 2 newcomers for the pantheon (the brothers Sogetsu Kazama and Kazuki Kazama) and brings some new backgrounds.\n\nIn spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flw69lZwIIw","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"a04170ce-7e43-4423-aaa2-e755d8e0feff.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"4af9191e-e9e0-4028-9c60-fd0692f9987f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"9163a733-e6f1-4601-9457-da2913577eda.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"860e4c01-a071-4ac6-93dc-b121bb02ad09.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"b9bff2c1-55c5-4902-b63b-80cadf9a125e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"1e5e4249-5e8d-4b89-8c10-120184b9b77a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"4c862fc2-390a-45b4-bfdc-2f38407727de.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"b7047742-dbf4-4acf-95a5-b8aa54e1f13e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"0e40ac82-d2f7-4988-b188-b967a74f86bd.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":985,"FileName":"00c8625a-6407-4309-9a55-6bf49f7b20d1.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":985,"AlternateName":"Samurai Spirits: Amakusa Kourin","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":10470,"Name":"Samurai Shodown V","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Samurai Shodown has been a long-respected 2D fighting series for its animated and colorful characters offset by subtly gritty and intense swordplay.

The original Samurai Shodown came to market the same year as the first Mortal Kombat, and though it offered no “finishing moves”, the screen was frequently painted red with the arterial spray of blood from the losing character. \n\nIn this fifth iteration of Samurai Shodown, however, some of that intensity, and blood, isn’t as prevalent. There are a total of 26 characters to choose from, and the series best are represented --  Haohmaru, Hanzo, Jubei, Genjuro, Nakaruru (and her bird). Of course, it wouldn’t be an SNK title if there weren’t some truly bizarre characters as well. Kusaregedo, an oversized mutant with a purple vomit attack, would be a more appropriate character for Ghost Hunter. And true-to-form, the story mode ultimately pits you against “Gaoh” an overlord who has (wait for it…) demon-transformation powers.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Oeqpqlx9w","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Yuki Enterprises","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"2003-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"ce156ffb-c50b-4d75-af14-5bb815dc2236.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"5b86eb0a-7303-4409-9c52-adff5771bc54.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"8b5115cd-c295-430b-a542-c31deee95d06.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"e5fbdffa-8d49-43f8-9473-94b21a162f1f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"8d47668a-bf60-4da6-b12d-4e5ae16cae4c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"5f0e3d85-9a15-4923-bc61-c3b1769c6fb8.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"9f2c6399-8f2a-4401-a9a5-f300d982f9c1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"d0e6f8dc-2d77-4b8e-8c53-f11573e34661.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"7da51a93-0754-463f-8918-33ae74b89bc1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"73faa7fb-3e45-4807-a5d1-fdd7c07b0fba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"f6c996e7-1eaa-44a9-ae4d-91b24d3b5df9.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"ddcfded7-1407-4d13-9d26-e0f8ca43d3a8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10470,"FileName":"9b54c3b5-de5c-4807-bd0e-7aabc13d53b3.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10470,"AlternateName":"Samurai Spirits Zero","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":202492,"Name":"Samurai Shodown V Perfect","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The 2nd upgraded version of Samurai Shodown V (following Samurai Shodown V Special), the 13th main installment of the Samurai Shodown series and the ninth game of the official chronology (if considered the non-canonical games).

One new technique introduced in the game is the Front Grand Step, which allows the player to leap towards the opponent and cancel into a basic attack. The player can perform this technique while guarding from an opponent's attack, which will consume one Power Gauge level.\nThe game uses a different type of Power Gauge known as the Groove Power Gauge System, which has three levels. The Groove gauge fills as the player lands attacks against the opponents or guard attacks. When the gauge fills to Lv. 1 or Lv. 2, the player can perform Super Special Moves, a Guard Cancel Attack or a Guard Cancel Front Step maneuver. When the gauge is full, its reaches MAXIMUM level and a MAX Activation occurs. During MAX Activation, the gauge will change into a timer and the player gains the ability to cancel any of their moves anytime (in addition to Super Special Moves and Guard Cancels). Once the timer runs out, the gauge returns to Lv. 2.\nIn addition to the regular Super Special Move, each character also has an Exceed move which can only be performed once when the player's life is less than half.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQnd4Cw4oMU","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"Playmore","ReleaseDate":"2003-07-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"efb418bc-4561-410d-bc0a-860f73d1f378.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"52960323-67d9-4a1b-8b14-ece47d7b006d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"ca17f680-8d16-489f-b223-ac22898168c0.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"53f0904a-65f3-4c94-97ab-56d1ace823ed.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"c86ccf52-c631-44a5-881a-ce80e90101ae.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"53455d72-8fed-4171-bf22-ce9cf04fb8ca.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"e3298521-c3aa-43e8-9b2d-16758199694f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"522a7bcf-6986-4fa7-a334-806cc12beb48.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"144bec6c-2cdf-4224-9eab-05a40dd35c90.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"c1a2e19f-2a28-4f27-9449-8a9734b16fb0.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"44cb497c-1fa0-4be0-aca7-01dca32925b8.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"3a84b07b-b57b-4d56-9f13-b49a656e0cc4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"37eb45f3-8d06-4839-ac3c-5a23bbf3ed71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10482,"FileName":"02a01e74-8e3f-4a56-a0f3-04bd4caca0b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":18960,"Name":"Syougi No Tatsujin: Master of Syougi","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The syougi is a Japanese chess-style game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/U9LEmEbjxfs","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"188e9ced-faf3-40a6-9d8d-fc5d1857ca0c.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"e67cb649-7032-4a89-8ba5-feb9daf2696c.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"1b224754-09d3-44f9-90c7-613968633f82.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"8a1baa36-a3fc-41dd-816e-df66f1e2b075.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"9084a299-8c80-4ab2-a23e-d8104af8e090.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"7238f1fa-1882-44c9-a9c7-bc82dee44cf0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18960,"FileName":"11446dc5-b93a-4cb5-a4c5-970120f6c5ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18960,"AlternateName":"Syougi No Tatsujin: Master of Syougi","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18960,"AlternateName":"Shougi No Tatsujin: Master of Shougi","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":116681,"Name":"Taisen Idol Mahjong Final Romance 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Originally on Neo Geo CD is ported unnoficially to AES console.

It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic.\n\nThe sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that. \n\nThe announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the \"fun.\" \n\nAt first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E-201c6Vv8","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1997-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"f46d2842-1e54-432c-adba-2f2df78ac186.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"2ef5693d-2c2e-4fd6-b7a1-736caf447319.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"775d82fb-59be-48d9-a0f3-4ea6a2999ae1.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"c98a952d-f24d-4220-821e-8a9f1064d986.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Marquee","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"70491c55-839f-42c2-9cb6-c2e9348313fb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"22dd49de-e84b-4501-9e25-9991f90045a6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"b443d7ad-d7b8-43f8-a66a-27486d6e6524.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"19a09051-4253-46c7-8b1a-b79e07ea3069.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":18961,"FileName":"38a264ee-ae72-45bf-ba9d-ac7e99d6691f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18961,"AlternateName":"Ultra Denryu Iraira Bou","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":18961,"AlternateName":"The Irritating Maze / Ultra Denryu Iraira Bou","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":10062,"Name":"The King of Fighters 2000","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The King of Fighters 2000 is the seventh game in The King of Fighters series.

Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren't exactly willing to work together on friendly terms.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Om7DS0j8s","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo AES","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"4a9dca1b-29ff-4563-b886-7f4eb4c5f81f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"958f2ba7-6508-4038-8bad-dcfca493ec98.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"dbfcd2d4-4bbb-4edc-b2bc-496b507af117.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"f045163b-1dbe-4d40-a3ab-b12c8a8f1ceb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"2677d392-4487-42d0-8320-958d8a2905da.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"1b3d0670-d004-4cb6-ae28-5b15b1429d52.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"a840ad71-6c7f-4ebf-8234-5b7c2727ef0e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"d3a2f0ce-42cf-4d05-82fd-ad8eef027328.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"e8b783c4-a193-4598-8a51-589d4fe088c6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"53dd0e21-02f4-4703-8aaa-99a69ff0f9e8.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"2d830cf4-6845-4996-94fb-92dcc51ebe70.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":979,"FileName":"2dcdfe74-d9c7-4ce8-b937-a66230980c86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":980,"Name":"The King of Fighters '97","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Despite the events at the end of the previous game, the KOF tournament was a huge commercial success and sparked a worldwide fighting craze.
