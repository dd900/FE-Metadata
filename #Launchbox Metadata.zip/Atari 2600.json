(if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fBC3Pvpl91k","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ghostbusters_(video_game)"},"1341":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Im Reich der Spinne","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Netmaker","Region":"Australia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ed Temple","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1a74f853-3ad6-4cce-ba2b-0875e60efbd7.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"1b25c0b7-c19a-42a8-9d28-3ff4dca6c2ef.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"549be444-dd0e-496c-8015-f95d162b4cbc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4f65a340-8f15-4b7f-9d1e-75796cc221c8.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d975fca9-92b0-4127-abb8-a00f447a4620.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3a4d13f2-ad06-4630-9954-aa2c79a00036.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1f39bf73-9349-43cd-be2c-1fcab6f04350.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"96e1e639-2a16-425d-8e5f-4a135b87fceb.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4ad51523-dd45-4d3c-a8aa-5789460e39b6.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a305407f-d2ef-4aef-bc7e-2b167805d4a3.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7bea3d10-c585-4082-b1f6-45b014c0b801.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aa524520-6149-4a00-b15f-de880baaad26.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"939725be-4f80-4ea3-841b-359a41bbf69e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0cf9d310-bd87-4f5a-9df4-da1f69775ebf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2e618bb9-1f5d-469c-91e0-6ef2c4674f83.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"498b964c-acab-4b37-b305-12e4746cc10c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9cfad195-1571-49ef-b7f4-c225e7261e92.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Amidar","Overview":"As a paintbush, run over the borders of each rectangle to color them in in order to complete the level, while avoiding enemies.

When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.\n\nThe player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.\n\nAsteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed.\n\nAlien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.\n\nGame Difficulty and Variations\nThere are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.\n\nThe game also offers three different game variations:\n\n    Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.\n\n    Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.\n\n    Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.\n\nScoring\nThe score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.\n\n    Small saucer - 1,000 points\n    Other player's ship - 500 points\n    Large saucer - 200 points\n    Small asteroid - 100 points\n    Medium asteroid - 50 points\n    Large asteroid - 20 points","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xP1Jtjk5vXY","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asteroids_(video_game)#Ports"},"1343":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Michael Feinstein","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0b02f3cc-e1d7-4469-a55d-9e6459bb7f66.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"af3aedd2-5c3b-4056-bac6-af40ff528b5d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c6a75ae9-07cd-4d83-bd7a-7a0d3ef15c78.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bfc90adf-0458-4829-a739-8cb59dadc6fd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0a1991ac-c2a2-48c4-a6d5-9cdd31e75f52.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"adabea86-8813-462f-a2b9-6e4bb04d08a2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"dce8c579-6435-45f0-b85f-da21b571fa08.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a2914e0d-caef-4ec3-b3fb-c0d71e27d7ec.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f770f1c-3516-4098-843a-70e367926d9c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"2e088083-9c50-47ac-95fb-e6cec238d115.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"03ccdd2f-cd21-4c3f-993c-3b66301f656a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a2fc63ab-1721-4fa1-b4ad-3ff019a20a3c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c0af166-2f38-4204-943c-3aee3c969f01.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f8b5a6ce-b423-4692-9805-c26c35224da6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Battlezone","Overview":"Commonly considered the earliest progenitor of first-person shooters (FPS), Battlezone is a 3D tank game initially released in the arcades, and later converted officially to many systems.

You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.\n\nA standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points when destroyed; a supertank is worth 3,000 points; and the flying saucer is worth 5,000 points. The guided missile is worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a single shot from the player's tank. One bonus tank (a bonus \"life\" or \"man\") is awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points; an additional tank is then awarded at 100,000 points. \nThe player can hide behind the solids or maneuver in rapid turns once fired on to buy time with which to fire himself.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zo4bSrD4ZDQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)"},"1344":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Black Jack","Region":"North America"},{"Name":"Black Jack"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bob Whitehead","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"1948ce58-abe6-4d44-8b7c-6bb7490bfac4.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"99a35338-42e0-47ab-9fc0-a3d9ca8b3af1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"925f3faf-994a-4947-87fd-d5f98c3630a6.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b9ab6c92-7cc3-47bf-a0ca-a6f2b848cdff.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d19e9ba4-9efb-4d9a-82a3-46510d505e75.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3f7d1c34-6795-4991-9533-914c75a21e32.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3e2593d7-874e-43dc-ab54-5822802c95f1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8ca686e3-f68f-4923-a2bd-bb91fce6be12.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7f44b209-faba-4688-9b0a-c92e7cfe142e.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6180171c-c093-4156-847a-02afe2bad54b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":3,"Name":"Blackjack","Overview":"Blackjack is based on the casino card game of the same name.

Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves.\n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands.\n\nInsect Opponents and Mushrooms\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\n\n    The Centipede\n    The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\n    Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\n    The Spider\n    The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.\n\n    The Flea\n    The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\n    The Scorpion\n    The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\n    Mushrooms\n    Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom. \n\n\nGame Difficulty and Variations\nThe game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:\n\n    One Player\n    Two Player Alternating\n    Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\n    Dual Player Competition\n    Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\n    Team Play Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player. \n\n\nScoring\nThe player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:\n\n    Centipede Head - 100 points\n    Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n    Spider at close range - 900 points\n    Spider at medium range - 600 points\n    Flea - 200 points\n    Scorpion - 1,000 points\n    Restored mushroom - 5 points\n    Destroyed mushroom - 1 points","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IcB_B03Cx5I","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Centipede_%28video_game%29"},"1347":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Earth Attack","Region":"Canada"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9db6b633-6533-4bc4-9a5d-1ec0c6fcefeb.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"01032ee1-2e6e-4be1-9c88-bfb7627794ff.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"008f9c4f-7551-4e79-ac3c-f6df0bd8f512.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"75e181d6-6a37-49fc-9d7d-e7b2dd2418a4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c8763ee0-1640-40df-b44d-3bae01fee3ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"e4b0d584-9bbb-47c5-9b8c-280aac64e288.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"ebdfd2fb-e875-4ca7-ac5d-fd6fec807897.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aeacfc8c-a7d5-4924-a5a1-d7d31d3b3654.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"bffe2196-ded9-4c03-92c4-57eb86de5d34.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"e452f313-8955-4286-9627-1e68ce351143.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8d17d74d-75c1-48ff-8fc6-aaba73d2f9cc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f1f61f7b-0055-40ef-9150-97c19b79a6c1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4a24d8a3-0f17-404f-a7db-bac444c7f436.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"194f3355-8763-42c4-a6cd-c46a1a00ce5b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3b245fd1-0144-4dc9-8615-2894e6bd8022.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"85e10446-946e-4ee2-9afe-dc6c80ac765f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Defender","Overview":"Defender is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling shooting game set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qjdEsciNRjE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Defender_(1981_video_game)"},"1348":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6ac6de06-2b2e-4997-bdb4-c433324bfc76.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d43b4a1f-cd03-4d28-9e82-b40bab733f19.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f8ecefd8-7d1f-498d-97ec-c8f3b9cdd548.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"12655ca2-6287-47d6-882d-2d9900b975d4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"73d10eb6-93e4-43d9-8a5c-46fe3167b6ff.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cbfc865b-7f5b-4429-ad7c-cde67206e0f0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"736b3eeb-99ac-46d6-a2e2-f443367eab85.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8814f4eb-26b4-4833-a58d-5345b33a4195.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29c6a415-73a8-436d-9de5-801c69f243a8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d5bb5422-47eb-4e7c-a138-8b162a3f5357.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"76a23b20-18c6-4ff5-ad44-ef8dcad450a0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"80e7cd83-bac2-4274-bdf6-8c1e067a56fe.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6a840bf0-9de3-455b-8808-19abc9d7815a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0be92db1-fd13-43e2-a7c5-83f0f1830f5a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gravitar","Overview":"The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save.

Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded \"unbeatable\"(?) pterodactyl.\n\nThe game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.\n\nOther versions with the same title:\n\n\nAtari (NZ) \/ Monaco (Silver)\nAtari (USA) (Gray)\nAtari (USA) (Red)\nAtari (USA) (Gray)\nAtari (USA) (Silver)\nAtari (USA) (Gray)\nAtari (USA) (Gray)\t\nAtari (USA) (2800)\nCanal 3 \/ Intellivision (Tape)\nEdu Games \/ Edu Juegos\nPlanetary Headquarters \/ Hin Seng\nPolyvox\nPop Video\nSpaceVision\tSupergame\nSuperVision\nTaiwan - Atari 2600\nVideo Game (Brazil)","Publisher":"Atari (USA)","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Iw6LiRBp1W4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joust_(video_game)"},"1351":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John Allred","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"21fe9444-6744-4b12-8caf-6069e862486d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9c943b62-c5d5-402a-b253-784e4934a3ae.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"015a8970-0af9-4087-b6e6-c9eb2aba85ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ad56224c-c015-4d6e-8185-f153e1e7b893.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"280efcb0-96a2-48bf-91c7-455e22353bca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"a7cccecb-cc6c-43bc-883b-eb7efb8654f4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c41797ee-76d1-4185-bc19-b7dcdec6eddd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"906d2493-6203-46ea-b7a2-b820dfec8028.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f47d7f66-3558-43f2-bcf3-8bff64ea80f6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"955817ec-e72e-4ca9-8113-08ba98a3dc8a.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ee8e0732-1798-4aa4-8f08-74f121c644d9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"007049a0-8446-49e2-a55a-edf916549de8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4f9c250c-d37f-4fdd-90f2-468d86f2d53f.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6aa7bc13-653e-4535-b04e-5edf8bfa5682.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jungle Hunt","Overview":"Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.

As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers.

Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"1367":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Stargate"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Vid Kidz","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4a5f68f6-3bb7-416f-b0ae-e1b9300975c4.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"462a337b-79be-491b-a945-8b9f05479c60.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a89583d1-c78c-4315-94ab-b18d6f3c03d1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2dfedce7-4889-46d2-a9db-4f85eac87c3e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e9063f0b-f8cb-465a-8cd3-0e8b1784c605.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Defender II","Overview":"This sequel adds new enemy ships to the alien fleet such as firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies (note that Yllabian is based on \"Yllab\", the word \"Bally\" spelled backwards, a friendly poke at Williams' then-competitor, Bally Midway), Dynamos and Space Hums.

The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.\n\nThe mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!\n\nYou are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter. You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"Nightmare Manor\" -- Original title\n    \"Casa Mal-Assombrada\" -- Brazilian title","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hIt2g9lZ_c0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Haunted_House_(video_game)"},"1371":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Kaboom: Schneller Als der Knall","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"da249597-ead7-4628-b5fc-46b2cdc01d7c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"6fa2ffab-12a9-494c-8ae4-97cddd062275.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0d55050d-cfe3-4a4c-a7dc-11036beea4e1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d82192fc-7f2e-4ecf-8ac5-cea4c49dbb36.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"efe30c20-42da-45de-8e31-95bf3e27f896.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"bc6ce1e7-dc69-4f39-a997-a4c151109951.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6f81702-fd97-4b1f-818c-502e23927d6e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"3df77666-577d-421c-ae64-d951e43d0bd9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7c5b5d73-5ce1-426a-9368-1a4943af8eaa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dc9f2af5-72ae-4d19-9563-0fd3b237c5cb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3aa391ab-e99c-4e3d-85c0-78500eb7b75e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"605534b4-3194-4359-a657-763cb3c30e29.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kaboom!","Overview":"The mad bomber is on the loose!

When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"2570":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Adventuri","Region":"Brazil"},{"Name":"Aventura","Region":"Brazil"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Warren Robinett","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"65565aab-8b4d-470b-b10b-4c702f1a71e8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0fde6a29-76ff-4f3a-bb57-776ea7ef8bd4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1e796d1f-6d7d-4ba1-9a82-7b8b8a951dcc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"910aede1-d305-46ba-b8e6-395570f6a466.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2b976ff5-efb0-4ba0-ac50-6fc9b960a941.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"845be896-aa3d-4ff2-b042-6069263d33ff.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"946b07b6-2bd5-4bd5-93be-d8246c65e264.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ba434122-0252-4860-a7f2-55c7ebe2d365.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8aa3424e-75eb-4217-8ec6-b016f48762d6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9f375fa2-408b-4dc2-be2e-3677420925f7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ba1a385f-6277-407a-8ea2-dddd4f240f54.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0f349d21-aaa9-4adf-ac09-b9fd25a10d12.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e4e6a03f-e3c2-4fef-92b5-e329fe31c414.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cf3be028-af6a-4395-8962-3ccb7dc0bd9a.JPG","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"21297ce9-f1d5-4412-b42a-54539799f79e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4c7e102d-a989-4c1d-a20b-644f34ffe4b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04dcb13f-1d04-40a7-a411-de0a3878c46a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0a5c027d-adfd-451d-bdda-76a6004b2ca1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"113898bd-ffe9-47b3-88f6-440cd89f6c77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bb9e8c9c-406e-43cc-b8b7-832fe2f053e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Adventure","Overview":"An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. \n\nThis is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgle, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.\n\nThere are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).\n\nThe Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom\n\nAdventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1978-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I6-zN_eaRd8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adventure_(Atari_2600)"},"2876":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coleco","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a4e0e320-36fc-42a2-882b-16268569bf65.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"73e9ad04-0b9e-4e73-bd79-1221ff5b3002.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"569feddc-cce1-4853-ad81-de4b1f608b1d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"206e4408-764f-4a73-8b53-2968e676b64b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6021417e-767d-43dc-8b76-4936ea1376dc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d269b4d4-e988-432a-ad42-395ce759301f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36148a46-9f85-4572-ac3a-0d219e02b96d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0d9c388-4b2c-4da8-9eca-d2dec60cacdb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0e76d0c1-7906-4d85-9637-556eae624c4d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"49be4271-95a3-4720-9bda-4fb6f3e2929c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5a5a453c-e62d-479e-8e53-1a4b2672ea5c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0d8cf73b-38e6-4bea-a0a7-f423b36d105d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"07fae70e-cbff-4aed-871e-f2cd8964fbfd.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"eccdadf1-52e1-4d7e-a3c9-c8b69784c4c2.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4c274ac6-dad4-440b-9445-f1a91572b275.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"56f7e491-d429-417a-9df2-95b0922c34a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4a67bdf1-1d39-49d5-81a6-f29564afbc8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Donkey Kong","Overview":"In Donkey Kong, Jumpman must rescue a damsel in distress, Lady, from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular characters.\n\nThe game is divided into four different one-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final screen occurs at 100 m.\n\nReleased in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally \"Jumpman\") and Donkey Kong.\n\nDonkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IzI1RBdK2_g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)"},"2957":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Parker Brothers","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1e2a4dbf-1226-4d19-bcf8-fd039e68319b.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2450e21c-0dfd-4497-9d28-6b63edc75c79.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7caf0ad8-f7fe-455c-8886-9175f881b1d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"872f7c19-d1fa-433a-9663-73b018fbdae3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26e0cead-82fc-40b9-bb16-23871d54fc6d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7ce58100-9259-4e2c-8681-2e241cee3004.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fab0a259-bef9-4cf7-ad18-4b00b540746c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2edb8135-2e9e-4ef0-bbc3-083359a415f6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"67f6ed1d-2d5f-42b8-a0ed-2333ff44543c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spider-Man","Overview":"The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper!

It was released as one of the nine launch titles for the system in October 1977, and was included in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982. \n\nCombat is a two-player game where the players attempt to shoot each other's tanks or planes. Hitting the enemy vehicle pushes it back and gives the player one point. The game contains 27 levels, each of which has different rules and playing field layout. On the tank levels, the players have a selection of two different mazes or no walls at all, while on the plane levels, the players can choose to play with clouds that obscure part of the screen. The Atari 2600 difficulty settings can be used to change the range of a player's missiles, as well as the speed of one's airplanes in levels 15-27. All games have a time limit of 136 seconds.\n\nThe levels include:\n\n    1-5: Tank levels. Levels 3 and 5 are \"straight missile\" levels where the players' projectiles simply fly forward. On the \"guided missile\" levels (1, 2, 4) the projectiles can be controlled with a joystick after firing.\n    6-9: \"Tank-pong\" levels, where the players' missiles bounce off walls. In the \"billiard hit\" levels (8 and 9), there's an additional rule that a missile must bounce at least once before it can hit the enemy tank.\n    10 and 11: Invisible tank levels, where the tanks only become briefly visible when they shoot, bump into a wall, or are hit by a missile. Both of these give the players guided missiles.\n    12-14: Invisible \"tank-pong\" levels. Levels 13 and 14 use the \"billiard hit\" rule.\n    15-20: Biplane levels, where the players fly planes that are constantly moving forward and wrap around to the other side when they fly off the screen. Levels 15 and 19 use guided missiles; 16 and 20 use straight missiles; on 17 and 18 the players use rapid-fire machine guns. Additionally level 19 is a \"2 vs. 2\" level - both players have two planes each that move and shoot together - and level 20 is \"1 vs. 3\", where one player has three planes while the other has a single large plane.\n    21-27: Jet fighter levels. The jet planes move faster than biplanes, but other than that gameplay remains similar. 22, 24 and 27 are straight missile levels, the rest are guided missile levels. Additionally 25 and 27 are \"2 vs. 2\" levels, while 26 is a \"1 vs. 3\" level.\n\nOne of the very few Atari 2600 games actually programmed to be in stereo (which can only be experienced with a modified system).","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1977-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9E8xnaWm2Cg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Combat_(1977_video_game)"},"4889":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"770197e1-4bf9-4b42-b86b-d246f6c2b339.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f03cf380-3807-4c4a-8743-ba51a9d719d7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0383a2e7-ca60-4a2e-bdd6-47b557654b72.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b0b6f160-8491-4796-81e2-ff8cef30ef39.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d0f007ea-9b58-4f75-8ef8-55007781b693.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fa7ca332-05fc-4c12-ab81-37654397db2d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"9844fcad-da39-46ad-a8c0-50c4b1589a79.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"34b0fbc1-772c-4e0e-a9f9-60333fa2989a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"e9454311-513f-4642-a35d-af3272b1f7ed.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c3eeae9b-ac62-4c61-bef1-115061d60512.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"23ead785-0e86-4ae1-a2b3-00a3d134cab2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"44ae8cf7-706a-45fb-9fed-97229e31c49b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"39a432dd-342d-4aec-a6f2-4336635b7b77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fe9e820f-9aa3-4ec1-87f1-20a5a21824f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pac-Man","Overview":"One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.\n\nPac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (\"Inky\"), the trailing red ghost Shadow (\"Blinky\"), the fast pink ghost Speedy (\"Pinky\"), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (\"Clyde\").

On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen. The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.\n\nIn games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.\n\nIn games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired. In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6.\n\nIn games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.\n\nIn games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.\n\nIn Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.\n\nEach of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.)

The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1980-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BVODkDgY4JQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Circus_(video_game)"},"5302":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"72962858-3e07-4a2a-b95e-d967e3ab289d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2074e017-c13a-40b5-88e2-6064915a4a4e.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"459e0783-a428-45c8-89cb-3511d0084b96.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"52888a77-f027-4e9a-9819-066cfc567a2b.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"1de0bfdb-adab-4faf-a2db-d5a6f07baa15.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"760646d2-9de4-4eff-81c7-81e2fb403511.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"bbbd25a3-a916-47c5-8692-07da29830377.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f2d04fd4-21dc-4f05-9f05-2de2be1b42d1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"587d0a80-df96-4ab6-b627-ed141228afc4.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4dda5959-c699-4977-a2f2-b0d02eb631ee.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Double Dunk","Overview":"Double Dunk is a simulation of two-on-two, half-court basketball.

One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to \"get to the other side.\" Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"\"Das Verruckte Huhn\"\" -- German title\n    \"Bloody Human Freeway\" -- Activision prototype title\n\nTrivia\n\nBefore Freeway became a game about a chicken crossing the road, it was originally known as Bloody Human Freeway. While the gameplay was exactly the same, players controlled a human instead of a chicken. If the cars hit the person, he would explode into a little blood splatter instead of being bounced backwards. Bloody Human Freeway can be found in playable form on the Game Boy Advance version of Activision Anthology.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1981-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XGMnbhULr-4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freeway_(video_game)"},"5305":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Namco Limited","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9a52d755-c07e-4fb7-b8ab-bf11fbdedbb6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f3b6a529-77ec-4b0c-8a00-a5fc9cad2b66.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a357a055-fa70-463c-b2fb-476164e425e2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"01e762a1-c6fe-4d32-b674-399e8ff19f33.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8a9c8694-7d8b-4a49-b450-4091eb5e9a4e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5ce08d8b-4d46-4b99-babc-7b4abe0be0da.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4a380c66-be50-4a39-9195-8317ebc8f155.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a1bc3001-720d-4d56-825d-ed58e59c7c6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d218977a-de7c-40e8-adf1-a7184fb89e64.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"17deebac-f714-46e9-9339-93db5bad9b32.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cebe731e-70cf-4aa5-a349-93e87f918127.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e542b066-7c1c-4fbf-b43b-2c1c0e9a23f7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e3084ccc-051d-4485-b549-fdebf1077c64.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"70391dda-a52c-42ee-b4a8-79d9a76ec102.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"baee6938-1d47-4c51-85a0-13fb4c7b118e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b9d10e1b-4951-4e06-9e3f-9eb5c35185e0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"38ebb11d-d1fe-461f-8c76-d93922c2f573.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"2f548910-f2ef-464e-b4d6-94af06025833.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0a67468b-a1be-465e-a999-f231ffb2bd9a.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Galaxian","Overview":"Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top.

Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal.

All the forwards and backs run in their proper formation.\nThere are 54 different game variations (27 single-player and 27 multiplayer) that allow for different speeds, game lengths, and goal sizes.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LSEASVJIEx4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pel%C3%A9%27s_Soccer"},"5317":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Tom Boy","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Tom Boy","Region":"Europe"},{"Name":"Pitfall!: Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure"},{"Name":"Dschungel Boy","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Pitfall!: Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"David Crane","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"e14692d9-6305-41a6-a21e-9f89d57832ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"818acd59-df0c-41ed-9d5d-6185557f4573.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"981def2f-efeb-405c-88dc-cbb3195a42f4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"caee47bd-e25e-4104-b96d-640d4b404782.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3538349e-f224-48bd-833d-ffa89a58ea58.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6142a7ca-87f9-4a89-9159-c92e26882671.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f9539f89-51e3-41d6-81a0-bd8f79f86886.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a128976c-7932-4986-a5f4-be939753b5b6.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f3f03d64-e205-48a1-91d1-2838d1c3d70f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9609f1c7-e1d8-4cb7-b307-e4a481d4d154.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e15b13e-06b9-488b-a2cd-31056dbe15fa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"67c206ee-93bc-47d2-8e69-7645c074e737.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"f78de002-3828-4b9d-bd14-bc6d90322158.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8fb0ff4c-7434-4310-9e23-4660685db84b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b6862308-9d5c-41c1-88b7-4c887ec23597.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a97f693-1318-44b0-85b9-9ce2441a45ab.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"926ae65b-28b8-4e31-b769-1f96e1962ce8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"4d473f72-4da2-4f59-b1bd-1d4f4221d8dc.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"74fde1b3-28f1-4b3c-b26b-28bb89304945.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"89ac5a62-dfa9-4c5e-85a5-ce5fb715de63.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c5eb92e7-7e4c-459f-9765-2151da70a346.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"79fb1ed3-7bbe-4a11-b18a-3fbcd8c1bbb4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c982dd1e-7322-4730-ba40-eec4253fb0bd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fa11f0b0-e486-445a-b1c4-c66a69f195df.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9070a80a-6b25-4903-9985-9aa0265c07ac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8c14807f-4c65-401f-b6c3-43c9eca7be76.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3845ebbd-c440-4c92-b2d3-e5cbbff506b7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"93f0f282-dc59-4814-8f2d-7f6651bc39f2.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"83ae4fba-b142-4417-b5fa-4df9b02649a5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a47ca252-2331-4d27-8ba8-72dff7766aba.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pitfall!","Overview":"The player must maneuver a character known as Pitfall Harry through a maze-like jungle in an attempt to recover 32 treasures in a 20-minute time period.

Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on a vine to avoid them. Treasure includes gold and silver bars, diamond rings, and bags of money. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various places. This is required to get around some surface areas that have no way across otherwise.

In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and\/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!\n\nThe manual mentions the appearance of a 'special signature' on the final screen if your score is high enough (although this isn’t entirely true). On the final screen showing the Ark, the initials HSW2 (for Howard Scott Warshaw – the 2 denotes this is his second game) appear in your inventory.\n\nA screenshot of Jerome M. Domurat's initials in the 'Valley of Poison' appeared in several publications. For reasons unknown, this graphic was removed in the released version. Also, a second key exists in the program which cannot be found in the game. It seems the key was originally going to appear on the 'Entrance Room' (see the screenshots in the b&w ad below), but due to the way the kernel displays objects, it couldn’t be used.\n\nThe manual also states the possibility of an extra-terrestrial Yar near the 'Flying Saucer Mesa'. This is true and here’s how to find it: go to the 'Flying Saucer Mesa' with the Chai and a parachute. Walk off the bottom of the mesa and drop the Chai when you start falling. The Yar will appear above you at the top of the screen. Uncovering the Yar is required to reveal the initials. \n\nOther versions with a different title:\nCaçadores\nCaçadores da Arca Perdida\nLost Arck\t\nRiders of L.

You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle.

Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons.

When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and\/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.\n\nOnce you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs.

Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.\n\nJunior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.\n\nIn the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.

A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a \"knockout\") or two minutes have elapsed (a \"decision\").

The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UIqWKCXm-ns","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dodge_%27Em"},"7947":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"72ec8fec-569c-46c5-8c06-1150e22674c0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"410fd3c5-392a-4bf2-b622-b49b6b7f77c4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fbc8ad56-24cd-48e8-9707-e48730d54513.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4110ff09-ea0e-406c-ae10-4a5758085b90.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"610a7bc6-6d91-4061-a8f1-34213f998635.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"284a2a59-5363-4eed-ab31-7f37757977e4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"bb2dc980-2e6b-405d-ac3f-235b8eb41725.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1ca27388-f9df-4738-a4c6-97194eb16fcf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2d07ee62-5515-4bf7-830d-606c515816b1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c736f9ab-1879-4a66-9ad6-4985b005a918.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a3d6342-6f22-4bb8-9344-7d7c064018ed.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Golf","Overview":"Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1980,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uSWDrJhsRWI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golf_(1980_video_game)"},"7948":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Human Cannonball: Cannon Man"},{"Name":"Cannon Man","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"d1ac3347-423d-45f1-a3b5-272d60d80fc8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"df62abaa-f14b-428a-a6d7-28009779e85c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"43711b7c-2878-4709-95d6-ba35382c704a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"39fc2273-3b0e-4761-8bca-135e60e84998.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"446509dd-d0af-47cf-a647-685508f365cd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"09d97bbd-1da5-49a2-b0f6-3a4e2a7fbc54.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"f6730f1e-bd82-4815-8dd9-95224c02a68f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6e1fb5b2-58e3-4080-b379-894a411a5d03.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f11e75d0-99cd-48c8-8598-9877ca44b8c7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f875b9a4-1ad6-42e9-8baf-1484dc7a0b9d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7b293bb3-2f62-490a-8831-98b7d3cc01f4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Human Cannonball","Overview":"In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water.

Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer.

As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down. While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:\n\n    Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.\n    Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.\n    Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.\n    Electrical \"Nichibutsu\" signs with a dangling live wire.\n    Falling \"Crazy Climber\" signs.\n    King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.\n\nThe climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes.\n\nCrazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is \"The Lucky Balloon\", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ga2ClKOpppc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crazy_Climber"},"8353":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Garry Kitchen","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"2ffbb157-bfda-403d-9aa0-a29a8514d220.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"19f8a315-5cc2-4d82-bac4-01578e786535.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"865779ee-8dd0-47e9-aef6-2bee8c2d0b92.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"06ba8db1-cbf6-44bb-ba1e-f47dc85a9f37.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2919fcc0-2694-4897-82d4-4bc3b7bc265f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9e0e4a65-cd38-4c44-898f-a625c2ebab79.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"92b47d30-b8c3-48c0-8dee-52d4860cc84b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Air Raid","Overview":"The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThere are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen.

At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1983-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jvli9CXSqP4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enduro_(video_game)"},"9236":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Home Run: Baseball"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bob Whitehead","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"360c54e2-cbde-400b-8281-0547d7b5552c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"55d4b4a6-bdd8-4557-9711-ffa491733d1f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2d8a5a9b-d47d-4b78-a543-b0fc4f4d7c13.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f3576620-1a64-4651-bb79-e221f94380f5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"1d9288e6-5564-42b3-a77c-6603161e41c1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e594e44c-316b-490b-b5db-d9c83240ad66.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed05254d-f839-4d19-b182-bf3f8b24515f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fc630cde-b43b-4adc-9dfd-e0203a99aacf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"15e2f095-c51f-480d-b5aa-d40ffec6dbf4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd678921-aa7e-4981-a79c-4c6eeeb90270.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"781ee417-9660-49ec-96d3-19826c0aebfd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8fe6261b-b8ab-4d4e-9135-9cb1da401322.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d28d387a-11fe-4f4c-a121-a206bba716ab.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Home Run","Overview":"The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base.\n\nThe rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\nHome Run [Atari [USA]]\nBase Ball [Future]\nBaseball [Taiwan - Cooper Black]\nHomerun [Unknown]\nBaseball [Sears]\nBaseball [EDU Games]\nHome Run [EDU Games]\nHomerun [Polyvox]\nHome Run [Digivision]\nHomerun [Atari Cartucho Original]\nBaseball [Splice]","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r5bKhQuzysM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Home_Run_(video_game)&action=edit&redlink=1"},"9242":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Felix Return","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Bobby Is Going Home: Bobby Vai Para Casa","Region":"Brazil"},{"Name":"Bobby geht nach Hause","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Jumping Jack","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Bobby Geht Heim","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bit Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"01ad13de-ddcc-43be-8339-12d7a3d92c46.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"959475f0-6ecb-4d12-aa70-12218bca4fec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"982d3004-197a-4810-b3b1-dbb96d59c6ad.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6584df22-12ad-41e9-9423-210bb4493190.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"870b60ba-c3e3-4a4b-a9c1-c14858185ab0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6e1cd6f0-26cc-40f3-aaf1-0f61e4a8199f.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"65e1badf-4d81-4db0-aa75-e431742f19bc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bcaad47a-bc4b-4dbd-ac49-dc316e584317.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7fb0350b-dcf2-4e6e-b4dc-b36268c542c9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0847e5e-d79e-4f5b-a611-17c065b63146.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6bfffcce-60a6-46ce-89d9-9429b8bcaa6a.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6a5588ce-4a89-4896-af01-71ef99b1f78f.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"94248f5d-2ab7-466a-99b1-10b72ca53190.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a7dca4bf-be8c-49bc-8e48-e5e70b20ea7a.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c16814dc-dbf9-47c4-8f38-4d062563fbe1.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c7ab87e7-f903-4942-bfae-cb0cd3269d54.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6561e3f7-88d1-4061-a11a-85207c75a73c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"49714c73-c0cd-472a-89aa-4d8fa4e963dc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"33307eef-c451-4781-8d1e-33ba50ddc444.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bobby is Going Home","Overview":"Players control Bobby as he tries to make his way home.

Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"H.E.R.O.: Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation\" -- Tag-lined title\n    \"HERO\" -- Common spelling\n    \"Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation\" -- Unabbreviated title\n    \"ヒーロー\" -- Japanese title","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cx_nB1-wgfo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/H.E.R.O."},"10129":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Amstar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"848b1b6b-bc78-46e0-9b60-0b4794caf1ad.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"911e2b17-68c2-418c-84f9-3205fbbe1a8c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"1a6ed570-9a9c-4ab3-bc92-fc4dbd24f008.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"789ce583-ba2a-4f43-ac24-38b090221612.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"febc50ee-3498-4ff5-b7cf-f57df24ca50c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"894f53bd-a578-4cfb-baad-0f984b28d01b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e36c8294-3f59-412c-a1ba-3aad9838b411.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"660d2789-64e9-493a-8928-5ba58b2c500c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"323c6cf1-c312-42f6-b43c-b5d4e940f07e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"f2be355b-01c9-4d65-a14f-f4072d1a1114.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"552a7e6d-fbcf-431a-a230-931f4b975f00.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b6a7fdf1-c184-4540-82e7-2d5e31d74d59.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a8ccb49f-1146-49a5-965e-ed8576d81c51.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9b78fcd2-3315-48cf-90f7-fd3722ce056a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Phoenix","Overview":"Phoenix is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders.

Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BMJpPMYDP0Y","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Private_Eye_(Atari_2600_video_game)"},"14683":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"3D Tic Tac Toe"},{"Name":"Tic Tac Toe","Region":"South America"},{"Name":"Jogo da Velha 3D","Region":"Brazil"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"78d785e2-17dc-4355-a535-5f6cfe6659f7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3a6f601a-e541-4f20-b92c-67cce48cc697.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0c7ba259-9a1f-4372-a636-250d51fe248a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"09a6109e-d94d-4c63-be1d-38bfaecd7762.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2d92d082-928a-4487-b3ae-2ba1afb142f5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"be14d588-e375-4c86-9f05-db30b0dd92df.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"05c375d6-291f-448e-91b8-64254b2d71ba.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"723a1d8c-a401-41db-966a-0598e00c881b.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2af1c9c8-f452-42f0-a19d-64231c983531.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a885eb1c-80db-4562-97e1-399afd0f53ff.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"34d0e101-b58c-4903-8c92-fab058992b90.png","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"f8cd9f51-5175-4245-a404-16320b3b0202.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"fcb1b98e-4e9e-4efa-8306-63a47b690f34.png","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"e5e96a05-227c-435f-833e-7e543c91b603.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"858e43a5-fb1d-477c-a12a-9e5f737a1765.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"42f9dfdb-543f-4b77-8230-be92a31a25ef.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a89f36f6-1b11-406d-a44b-64690d324e2f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bac5e111-8314-4581-8a91-922ad270ae0f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bab78a6b-983e-4693-8f22-cb159e6e46dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7228cd1f-cd0f-428a-94f1-a5a7a81ee0e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"50a188a2-8809-4c4a-b6f7-f2136ae83932.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"9d301b92-66cb-469e-a2f3-13a5bf75234a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"11ab077d-8bd1-44fb-b31c-18801bf35cd7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bbc3bf46-5e7b-42f6-8a4a-189e010851ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f3907eb2-ca7e-4525-842c-7c568a062989.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"3-D Tic-Tac-Toe","Overview":"The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4×4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout.

You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side. The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.\n\nMarvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.\n\nTo rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.\n\nThe game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves. Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on. Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.\n\nEight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.\n\nThis game started out as Atari Video Cube but eventually was licensed under the Rubik's Cube name. This game is distinct from the similarly named game Rubik's Cube 3-D which is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of the cube faces at once rather than one.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tvEMva3frvw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atari_Video_Cube"},"17502":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Craig Nelson","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"b8dd243c-041f-4ebb-a1e9-569e22c28020.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3c3cccfa-9ba7-4023-8baf-10ff64d80c52.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4468a39c-bb27-4900-8c79-436e6c396328.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0573e44d-9e06-4d04-8879-ae9f184b2fec.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"722f59ee-8e55-478e-8112-47eb334b0882.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d9700c5e-4fda-483f-95a4-08bec63e692a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"3354ccec-2b57-4806-97ae-a77899b2c0f8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"43bf7752-9582-43aa-a250-048cd9f17fab.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fae19fcc-31a1-4042-9a3b-be99f1bacf44.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"bafc2ef7-986d-4c32-b5c1-bf87ab5c0176.PNG","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1d6b0e38-6502-4989-8000-f6825080a989.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Backgammon","Overview":"This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey.

For Atari, this is the variation used here:\nAll pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.\nNo piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.\nA roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s\/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.\nAfter moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.\nIf, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.\n\nDifficulty switches\nRight:\nA=computer rolls dice for you\nB=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers\nLeft:\nA=computer sets up the board for you\nB=you can set the pieces where you want them.\n\nGame variations\nGames 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player\nGames 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player\n\nGames one through four are backgammon\nGames five through eight are acey deucey\n\nGames 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1979-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aK0PFA3oJkc"},"17503":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bill Aspromonte","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"fe085252-7f2b-4879-8b0c-d2afda0a4c48.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9f60de31-b84a-4056-9cdd-c0d9ef6bb571.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"93125418-01f2-4aef-9736-7edf64294e7a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6fa4c63-4bea-4646-8190-5f0f4658a8eb.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"4b42c3a1-13a7-4b06-a189-6b4e341221a4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a9bab0e-db44-4122-b09e-2f24b627ca2d.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"84530983-9334-4195-90d3-916f86be8436.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc0f7707-c919-4afc-8a38-fa9ca7f69d65.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6076f87-c691-4f57-874e-697414d60ea9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bank Heist","Overview":"You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car. Your purpose is clear: perform \"bank heists\" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks. As you \"rob\" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments. You must avoid the cops to stay alive. Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.\n\nBesides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town. By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.\n\nThere are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one. Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to. This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in! If you run out of gas, the game is over.\n\n\nOther versions with the same title:\n\n20th Century Fox \/ Fox Video Games\nAtrevision\nCCE (Illustrated)\nCCE\nDigimax\nDynacom (Brazil)\nElectronic Games\tFunvision \/ Fund.

With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of \"mood slime.\" Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's \"courage\" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up \"elixir\" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of \"mood slime\" to keep the statue moving.\n\nThe UK-produced adaptation of Ghostbusters II contains three action scenes based on the film:\n\nIn the first scene, the Ghostbusters must collect slime samples from the sewers. One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected.\n\nIn the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled.\n\nIn the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams.","Publisher":"Salu","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gz4lZfjek9g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ghostbusters_II_(video_game)"},"17513":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Roach in Space","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Vladimir Zúñiga","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5cf588b8-685e-4b1e-bf8e-52575bb659a5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0f9dfceb-60f4-4f2b-bcdd-5a7eacce804d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2419329d-fbb9-43fd-a4b3-22174c622ab3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5748c0f6-7413-4d35-a5de-a9252a5875d2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4700efe6-148a-46cf-a362-090eb9151bf3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4e06a371-7455-49c0-b1ab-0554c12816b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"291dabde-cf87-44ee-9ef3-775278ae111e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"A Roach in Space","Overview":"As part of an experiment, a roach was sent into space.

It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up.

There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear.

It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance. As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the cup. Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.\n\nRather than a full 18 holes, this miniature golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.\n\nUsing the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1979-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8znfj2t8WYA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Miniature_Golf_(Atari_2600)"},"17522":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Emerson Radio Corp","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"1ec01d5a-767a-420f-bf7f-ad05bf56e5b7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2aae4658-1af8-4214-a432-eb66102be019.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74cc7879-c52d-4ff8-94ac-8a12af77ee93.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6de38429-c649-465d-9d07-7a30fea6f142.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9f7fc783-4e8e-4fc5-ba1d-7b1fe4d1c1e7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Missile War","Overview":"Missile War is an Action game, developed and published by Emerson Radio Corp., which was released in 1982.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\n\nAstro War\nAstro-War\nDead-Ray\nKampf im Asteroiden-Gürtel\t\nMeteor Defense\nMissile War\nSternen-Kampf\nSternkrieg\tWar 2000","Publisher":"Goliath","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"17523":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Absolute Entertainment","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"56b0b263-882b-42fc-b1e2-14536cc36dbc.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9b015d44-f833-4ebe-aeff-533f4001b4e9.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9391e49d-e395-453b-ba40-8f5f0d6cd863.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"67c81a4b-ad52-4dfb-bbec-6ef91ea0b702.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94279b4b-15e3-4ee2-9692-81291c41bb4c.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"21588f0d-d660-445e-bebd-dc0088d43ca6.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"852de7d0-24c8-49ad-b9a3-0f6b4c423a65.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"576e33c4-4ec6-44cf-9a9f-37c4b4360290.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"044d30d9-c1c1-443e-b118-def940c04e39.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"My Golf","Overview":"My Golf was programmed in the U.S. by Absolute Entertainment and sold to Home Entertainment Services.","Publisher":"Home Entertainment Suppliers","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O9gRmAtg_Og"},"17524":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"James Wickstead Design Associates","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e8720bca-7020-4fa5-b38e-51467efdb96d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0fffdae8-dd7f-4106-86a3-a8ad57b13371.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ed350b51-a871-4f47-8882-7f5cfb60ac35.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2f55bace-545a-49c6-a46c-0693bba9e67d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ed3058c6-fee0-4b5b-a3c4-d34df518069e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4f54297e-919d-4820-8e23-e5a375c10b2a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d2209572-c392-4a43-a017-064d671116fd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"69a9fa16-36f4-4d08-b4a4-6fbe452858f1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Name this Game","Overview":"You have discovered a long-sought-after buried treasure, and just when you thought you have discovered a long-sought-after troubles were over, things get really tough!

He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken!

Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.\n\nScoring\nKarate-chopping a meat ball=100 points\nBoarding the Swinetrek=1000 points\n\nIf you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.\n\nScoring\nYou get one point for every mile you get through the mine.\nHitting a Gonzoid=100 points\nEscaping the mine=1000 points\n\nThe difficulty switches do nothing.

Made possible by custom hardware built inside the game cartridge. Programmer David Crane designed and patented a component he called the Display Processor Chip (DPC), which could greatly enhance the 2600's graphics capabilities and could process music in three channels plus drums.\n\nYou control Pitfall Harry as he makes his way through an underground Peruvian cave in search of the valuable Raj diamond, as well as his lost niece and cat. Once all three have been found, the game is over. The gameplay is fundamentally the same as Pitfall!, but with a few new twists. The environments are no longer limited to a horizontal plane, so navigating through the complex maze of corridors becomes a matter of puzzle solving and timing. Harry has also gained the abilities to swim and float across chasms using a balloon. The scorpions make a return appearance, but there are many new creatures for Harry to avoid, such as frogs, bats, electric eels, and condors.\n\nThe PAL version of this game doesn't show a second rock on the left side of the first screen and also lacks the sunset sky of the NTSC version.","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0UR_vFVKnZ4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pitfall_II:_Lost_Caverns"},"17530":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Spectravision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"fb458b54-e1de-46a4-8d59-6f5ecefee985.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a6d934fb-0a56-4100-bcee-43b7a339903e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8b339c3c-ee7f-4dec-8259-c91f34f5fe53.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5bfb917a-55c4-4122-a89e-cf8023bd3cdb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c799e982-2a5b-4ab4-87b7-3dc974472403.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"47030d66-ebc2-4977-a0d3-f6206d660d97.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9496062b-4a2d-4f40-b0d9-f55db5216049.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"487e5a59-b90d-43a2-8d67-c939e7cc9222.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"feec0f6d-494e-4867-93b4-d43c19f95209.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5fbc4e2d-48ec-48f2-9384-8344f0e47199.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6428b910-8017-461c-9edc-5794811b5ffd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d55d756a-5355-4cb6-a270-03b740d800f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Planet Patrol","Overview":"You are on patrol to find and destroy enemy fuel depots.\n\nYour ship flies to the left, while you control your up and down motion.

In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.\nEach game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen – the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a \"The End\" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.\nThere are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water – in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.\nA version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.","Publisher":"Mattel","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X0rK-e21RdU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frogs_and_Flies"},"18879":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Sprintmaster"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Robert C.

Each of the two games was released separately, though it's generally more common to find them in this form. This particular double-ender is the most common to feature either of these games.\nThe Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases.\nXonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of \"double-ender\" cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.\nXonox was one of many small video game companies to fold during the Video Game Crash of 1983.","Publisher":"Xonox","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"19860":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Suntek","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"30ec25fb-473a-4a7c-8745-23b4cbd4e76e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0509635e-6325-42cb-a18b-7dd8e2ec11c0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5ee93143-665e-4e63-91bc-d81359b64e2c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d32b68e2-51be-470f-9439-988ce16b67f8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9ef273e5-60d9-46e7-ac35-97bca6e47e7a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3bb1c35a-5c5b-4541-9638-180a3c025da3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"76e58fb5-c34d-4c05-add5-0daa74f92b4a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"31efffb0-d54b-4825-bffd-f073e692a9ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"UFO Patrol","Overview":"It is a horizontal scrolling Shoot em´ up game.

The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.\nPlayers score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.\nPlayers who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nLaser Blast - Duell im Weltall.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DnC8xxTkUlQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Laser_Blast"},"19893":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Quelle","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"88a18f63-95ef-4d13-8dca-de17cb071ae6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super-Ferrari","Overview":"Typical racing game.

After you select the game vocabulary you want to use, you and your opponent take turns selecting alphabet letters to find the word generated by the computer. Both players together are allowed 11 incorrect selections. When you make a correct letter guess, you receive a consecutive turn. The first player to complete the Hangman Word scores one point and starts the next word. The first player to score five points wins the game.\n\nGAME 5:\nTwo players compete to complete the Hangman Word from a first through third grade vocabulary.\n\nGAME 6:\nTwo players test their word skill with Hangman Words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.\n\nGAME 7:\nWords from a first through ninth grade vocabulary are used for competition between two players.\n\nGAME 8:\nTwo players compete using words from a first through high school vocabulary.\n\n\nGAME 9:\nNow it's your turn to choose the Hangman Word. Instead of playing with a computer word, one player composes the Hangman Word with the Joystick Controller; the opposing player receives eleven guesses to complete the Hangman Word.\n\nTo enter your own Hangman Word into the computer, cycle through the alphabet letters on the screen while your opponent avoids looking at the screen. The Hangman Word may be between one and six letters.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1978-05-01T00:00:00-07:00"},"21035":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Surround: Chase"},{"Name":"Chase","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d84a587c-d9c9-41b8-8c21-d693799c07e4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"632e64d0-8007-44a6-937e-90870ebed304.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"d1a7fdcb-bba2-4462-85a1-4cfedb08bac9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cb4468a7-d2c8-4140-822e-a3cc988c2038.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"c1da2c65-befb-4df1-a6d1-f181c15bb11f.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6fb2ff48-a146-4c6f-9a0e-77c1b678094d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fbe4cc23-edb8-495d-b547-199befeb63b1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"a55b5d97-fc71-412f-b5c1-6bd621079eb9.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"07a13206-d2ea-4c3c-ac52-3fbefa070a8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Surround","Overview":"Welcome to the exciting and competitive world of SURROUND.

It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks \"fall\" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.\n\nKeep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a \"miss indicator\" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.\n\nSet your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.\n\nGAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nThis game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. \n\nDon't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's \"miss indicator\" as well as your own.  Bombs away!\n\nGAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)\nThis one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay \"suspended\" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.\n\nGAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nYou compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.\n\nGAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nGet set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.\n\nNo \"miss indicator\" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.\n\nGAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nThis game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.\n\n\nSEA BOMBER GAMES\n\nGAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)\nYou're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.

If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.\n\nSCORING:  \nPoints are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.\n\nAlso, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.\n\nAt 300,000 points, the word Amazing! appears on the top of the screen and the game stops.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EaRaHElHohc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dolphin_%28video_game%29"},"22153":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Dragon Treasure","Region":"Canada"},{"Name":"Dragon Treasure","Region":"Brazil"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bob Smith","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6fc04ff5-6a1b-4041-8ea5-3e285649c5ce.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3e154533-6de0-4128-ab2c-6409e2959f52.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"468dc3e2-830b-42dc-add5-d882f677ae26.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5ed05ff6-cabb-4225-b6db-a0df8fac76b0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"400ccfc4-8586-4553-b6d5-817034a12c4d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"94d2b4b0-8f34-45b2-b03f-226121754492.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18f869e5-cbde-44d2-ba6a-a647e536dd4d.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"283bf2cb-3299-4c4e-b4d4-1e53e2b51ecc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"09985ede-f409-478a-94be-cb05caa81e90.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"42aef76a-e61c-4812-9091-3314be2137b1.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2620c465-24c2-410b-8250-57ff8e5c6fa6.jpg","Region":"Canada","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5a955b5d-1d43-4912-9387-1e3c4cfda763.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b6a1ca39-38c2-4d4a-84c7-016c0210697a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b898b8ce-fbcf-429f-818c-28bdcf54b5ab.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"373ae542-ac64-48f4-949d-08e011a6f8cf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dragonfire","Overview":"The king's treasures have been stolen!

The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.","Publisher":"20th Century Fox","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZrxxBFBCq_A"},"22156":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sirius Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"5516831b-093c-42f3-a5a1-2dfade3472a7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e5bb3f48-f541-4198-bbec-9346eeb41566.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7eccbe7b-ac3c-48bd-9ffc-c09b76bc34d4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0dea28d0-7a75-4b2e-aba8-d788c6990113.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e89cdadf-4e63-4e39-9e8b-2a2d6caae150.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"42f1f10b-c5d5-468b-a13e-867f6b19e6dd.jpg","Region":"Brazil","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fb553f33-fdda-416d-a132-28eb472f5518.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"85aa02fd-1bde-4dbb-91ce-a8e7f599f24d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5f9481e2-611e-4de4-9c30-5c0d27ae01cc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5611a8b0-67f1-4d21-adf8-c1e6b8c7828b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"30ab3666-80a9-4129-aca7-0159968e71ed.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fast Eddie","Overview":"As Fast Eddie, you must go from floor to floor, collecting prizes.\n\nUp to two prizes will be on the screen at any one time on any floor but the top one.

In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid.

The first has an apple on top and the second has his mommy waiting to give him a hug. To progress up the mountain the player must stand on a raised block and press the button to raise a magical stardust ladder which can be climbed to reach a higher level. If needed, the player can also climb down. To reach the top level, the player must have all ladders raised or they will be blocked.\n\nOn levels two through five, there is a dream demon waiting to knock Teddy down the mountain. Teddy cannot jump, however; all the player can do is avoid the dream demons or catch mommy's special kiss as it floats along. This will allow the player to knock out one demon. The kiss eventually wears off, however. If the player is knocked off the mountain, they start back at the bottom of the first screen, with the apple at the top.\n\nThe score counter starts at zero and counts up. The faster the player gets Teddy to mommy, the lower your score. The goal is to have as low a score as possible.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\n\n Sesam öffne dich!

The game is played from a top down point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controlling your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!\n\nGAME 1: \nAfter programming your play, use the Joystick to control your players.  The offensive player controls only the ball carrier and the flight of the pass or punt.  The defensive player controls his lineman or, by holding the red controller button down, the defensive\nback.\n\nThe players will randomly follow the play as programmed when not controlled by your Joystick.\n\nGAME 2: \nIn this game, when your players are not controlled by the Joystick, they will follow the play exactly as programmed.  Use more strategy and try to outguess your opponent's plays.\n\nGAME 3: \nProgram in your offensive and defensive plays and watch the computer run them out.  Neither player can control the players movements, but the offense can pass or punt the ball by pushing the red controller button.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1979-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AxjcIm-UT1g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Football_(1978_video_game)"},"22202":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"2174e561-36b1-44e9-8b1c-d02cbd4efa47.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc2738e8-6313-4749-a572-3991c8e36ddc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6b2c4dcd-b239-4cda-a7d0-95b94cca6d03.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f5572304-4899-4aa2-971b-2109d86cdb30.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2c05f559-12a1-4327-9149-9c2c3ca7e2aa.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ff4951d0-ff4a-4169-919b-ca98d1ea3062.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tennis","Overview":"Tennis is a singles tennis game which can be played by one player against the computer or two players against each other.

Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!\n\nA secret area exists high above the mountain. Once reached, there are ways to increase your time, score and even the number of game variations (up to 256).","Publisher":"CBS Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tF6XzTLZLrI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mountain_King_(video_game)"},"22218":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"VSS, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4993d4b4-b1ca-4a39-a9b6-86c6baf43e99.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"18d9aa02-ceca-4ab3-ade2-c431229c04a4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"43a0c3bd-f93f-4c2b-9206-227b89ffbdcd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0e4b380b-a6e4-4eb1-a094-20f2068e6ad9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"604662b9-480a-42df-8aab-c166c4381b23.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"78a9689e-5a41-4d70-a961-0ea7d8f0c68f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b11c3d07-bcff-4812-9706-944aa25fcd35.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"64386d95-4e1d-4c43-935e-5a4937a533b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Quest for Quintana Roo","Overview":"Yucatan Sam explores the temples of Quintana Roo searching for the keys to open the ceremonial vault and acquire the riches inside.

Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.\n\nYou begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.\n\nThere are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:\nMaze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.\nMaze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow.\nMaze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence.\nMaze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once.\nMaze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel.

Originally announced in 1982, it was subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system. In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.\n\nEnvironments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.\n\nThe game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.\n\nThe game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the \"Games That Weren't\" section.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xSDfWuxc_xU"},"24954":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ed Fries","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"c3aed289-2e4b-46e7-8dc1-b8aa61e84ce7.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"39039d72-1227-4213-a39e-7ffd02645b7c.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"51082463-531a-4f6d-a400-971af4dcf35a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"955f7a49-32f5-433c-98bf-6c247e210ff1.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a82672e0-3bba-47de-b658-7080be0d40e4.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"301e92f3-619b-47ef-80a0-7132b4b4e858.png","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ae9fdc7c-ae1e-49f7-9de7-d0da0e27fe25.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"244e7a12-e8c1-4fc9-b775-ab73893772e7.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3ceea430-d029-44d0-a7a8-988dd098661e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"99db5370-4b7d-4e47-b912-68f954f3817a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Halo 2600","Overview":"The year is 2552. Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forced many of her former residents to colonize other worlds. After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.\n\nThis was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity. A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel and learn the location of the Covenant home world. But before the mission begins, Covenant forces strike and annihilate the attack force.\n\n \nThe Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The ship crashes on Halo--an artificial ring world that is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.\n\nYou are the Master Chief--all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super- soldiers. You are humanity's last and best hope against the Covenant--but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed. Can you battle your way through the massive world that is Halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?\n\nHalo 2600 is an original homebrew game created by Ed Fries for the Atari 2600. Ed Fries once worked as the VP of Game Publishing for Microsoft's Xbox division and was instrumental in bringing Bungie Studios into the Microsoft studio family). AtariAge worked with Ed Fries to produce Halo 2600 in physical cartridge form, and a limited run was produced for the 2010 Classic Gaming Expo. After the Classic Gaming Expo, additional cartridges were produced using a different label to differentiate the two releases.\n\nIn the game, Halo players control Master Chief in a non-scrolling exploration game with rooms to explore and a variety of enemies to shoot. The Chief faces a variety of enemies across 64 playfields, and must find hidden keys to unlock the game's force-fields in order to reach the final boss encounter.

You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.\n\nIf you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm.

As soon as Earth moves into range, the weapon will be fired and destroy the planet. The player controls a spaceship launched at the invaders in an attempt to destroy the weapon before it can be fired. To do so, the player must bomb five red weapons silos in a narrow trench. If one of the silos remains when Earth is in range, the planet is doomed;[4] George Plimpton bragged that the game depicted the \"total destruction of a planet\".\n\nThe player's spaceship is equipped with lasers and bombs, both in unlimited supply. The bombs will be dropped on the weapons silos, while the lasers can destroy enemy spacecraft sent to intercept the player. While the player has only one spaceship per game, the spaceship is well-armored and can take multiple hits, but each hit will cause some form of temporary damage affecting the player's control of the ship, such as decreasing its maneuverability or causing sporadic faults in the weapons systems. A hit will also cause the ship to lose altitude, making it extremely dangerous when flying low. If the player's ship collides with the trench or an alien fighter, the game ends and Earth is destroyed.\n\nThe game's scoring takes the form of a countdown timer. Starting at 8000 points, the timer counts down to zero, at which point Earth is in range of the enemy weapon. When the player destroys the fifth silo, the alien vessel is destroyed and the timer stops, thus representing the player's score for that game. Points are added to the timer for each destroyed alien fighter, giving the player additional time to complete the mission.\n\nAt higher difficulty levels, each silo must be hit on its first pass. One game variation starts with zero score and points awarded for each silo and alien fighter destroyed; any missed silo ends the game.","Publisher":"Mattel Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bO_XSmMKqp8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Strike"},"28695":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Billard","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dennis Koble","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a89f37a4-251d-4b07-b45a-c8306fb96c81.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"368124b7-95ba-47fc-9a44-c34717f7af41.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"11c308c8-8c47-473e-bd78-355ebc2cd0b8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb712510-15d8-4030-bc49-5a67f72cafc3.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10ca37cc-b961-4d48-aa8a-f3e99fdd75c8.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aa76b2ba-a3fe-41b0-a4b0-9d6baf353514.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d90c33e8-aa3f-40ca-bc9e-02e5ef8e05ff.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ce2896e5-c6c4-4211-83c5-248ed096e4b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"706248b5-cdb6-4259-9345-5dd0bd902271.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04326c3d-0a90-4b96-9525-4857b1d41cd6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Trick Shot","Overview":"Trick Shot is a pool game for one or two players.

Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.\n\n\n    The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.\n\n\n    The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view.

You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy \"Droid\" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.\n\nThere is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.\n\nYou control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.\n\nBouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.","Publisher":"CBS Electronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oMZdM7BOM_4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Omega_Race"},"28701":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Irem Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"a3c178c9-759c-4487-b27c-8e0c9919655f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7489e294-41a4-4824-91b4-d5e6e9f0f561.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"61cd9f1e-25d7-4087-9e82-a1111e8234f4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b657d365-c05f-44c9-aa57-bd7a0d525888.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"42e2382d-ae06-45a7-98bc-a476539e1ef1.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c9fdcb14-34bc-412b-a2e1-6417fe0f545c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"aa414f82-ecb6-4adb-b630-c8bc9dfcad56.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ddddc42f-f19f-450a-a4f7-36de21f17c47.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5961d55e-4f6c-4dc6-9809-43f302aba98d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5222d03e-07b4-4308-be68-04e85690948d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f7b63f43-fa13-484d-b537-3cbb9bbeb593.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kung-Fu Master","Overview":"Loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.\n\nMr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back.

You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.\n\nIf the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over.

It was conceived by Darrell Wagner at Dunhill Electronics where he was billed on the packaging as a \"Licensed Tax Consultant and former IRS Revenue Agent\". \n\nThe object of Tax Avoiders is to help \"John Q\" become a millionaire within one game year by collecting income and avoiding taxes. There are two alternating game phases. In one, the player moves around the screen, collecting dollar bills and avoiding red tape; this represents maximizing income for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the other phase has the player move around to manage his investments while another sprite oscillates between an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent, a certified public accountant (CPA), and an investment adviser. If the player is caught by the IRS agent, he is audited, and always loses the audit, which takes 50% of his income. If he encounters the CPA, he is charged a fee but gains new tax-sheltered investment options. If he encounters the investment adviser, he can maximize his tax-sheltered investment returns.","Publisher":"American Videogame","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Smz2vtJCWoA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tax_Avoiders"},"29353":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f810c2c1-1fbf-4611-a4c5-fdff222bd7d3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tank Brigade"},"29372":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Other Ocean Interactive","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a46330a3-6c2f-4fa0-bb11-d811bfa820bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"af4fa593-471a-4047-a62a-563331d4b9d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d4bd3685-54db-4064-a197-f2e355d95548.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Stacks","Overview":"Descending the networks of metal girders had always reminded me of old platform videogames like Donkey Kong or BurgerTime.

Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.\n\nThe object of the game is to guide Dumbo around the screen and catch or shoot balloons before they reach the top of the screen (sort of like Kaboom in reverse).  Some balloons have bombs attached to them and are deadly to the touch, so they must be shot down using peanuts from your trunk.  Every now and then you will see a balloon with a clown riding it, you must shoot these balloons and catch the falling clown before he hits the bottom.  If the clown makes it to the top of the screen he'll stay up there and begin to drop things on you.  Every time three balloons reach the top of the screen the ceiling gets slightly lower, this gives you less and less room to grab the incoming balloons.  The ceiling can be raised a bit by safely catching clowns or by winning the bonus round.\n\nScoring exactly 10,000 points (or multiples of) causes the balloons to turn into the initials PcN (for Peter C.

The Alliance has lost many ships while trying to explore the planet. Too many to count. \n \nIt will be your mission to rescue downed pilots and return them to the Mothership.\n \nGet to know your ship:\n \nAt the start of the game your ship will appear in a safe area of the planet.\nYour ship is only large enough to hold three pilots. You only have one ship complete your mission. Your ship has a strong shield that can sustain 8 hits before it will be destroyed. The shield is indicated by the bar on the bottom right of the screen. Most enemies will take one shield unit away as you are hit.\nThe exception is the Orb with will take two shield points away. \nYour ship is equiped with \"lazor cannons\" They can shoot left and right.\nTerrain hits WILL (in latest release) damage your ships shield units. \n \nThe Mothership:\n \nAfter you have saved three pilots the mothership will descend on the safe landing area. Because of expensive fuel used by the mothership it will not descend unless you have three pilots aboard your ship ready for rescue.\nYour ship must dock with the mothership to transfer the rescued pilots.\nAt that time all of your ships shield power will be restored full. You will\nalso get 100 points for any remaining shield units.\nYou will get 1000 points for each pilot returned to the mothership.\n \nEnemies:\n \nThe Orb - The orb will be aggresive and try to ram your ship. If hit you will\nlose two shield points and one rescued pilot will be removed from your ship.\nDestroy the Orb as soon as possible.\n \nMeteors - Meteors can not be shot and must be avoided. If they hit your ship\nyou will lose 1 shield unit.\n \nFalling Craft - The purpose of these has not been discovered. They can not be destroyed by your cannons and must be avoided.  \n \nPlanet Patrol - Look to defend the planet. These enemies can be shot. One of these, if hit will drop a shield unit.

You also have control of a small block to that you can use to help you navigate the level.\n\nThe number of moves you've made is shown at the bottom of the screen. Each level has a minimum number of moves required to complete it, and if you go over this the display will change color.

Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.\n\nIT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)\n\nYou use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.\n\nAs you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).\n\nAfter you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.\n\nYou start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.\n\nGame variations\nAfter you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.\n\nThe difficulty settings are:\nEasy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.\nNormal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.\nHard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew.

There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track.

Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.\n\nThe child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.\n\nThe left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.\n\nThere are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.\n\nThis is one of the rarest Atari 2600 games and apparently saw fairly limited distribution.","Publisher":"Simage","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FxFviBhsb_I"},"31932":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tigervision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e9929ada-c86a-4d41-a806-fdfb72ae28cb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2ef0c0bb-70fa-45c1-a02b-2dc30c5efbad.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"add70f95-a1e8-4400-aa75-0a90cbe8be66.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"46c74dbd-e36e-4b73-832c-fee619ecc35e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d9e85542-51d4-4aca-9770-a58a3103ffce.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8b00054e-6227-4969-af6b-254af0201b94.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"215d97d9-83ff-4a28-998f-6af9b934080f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3ddad38c-c43a-40ec-a5d1-4c034b1fdd47.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Espial","Overview":"You are a space attack pilot flying at death range over a gigantic space ship.

A direct hit on an asteroid with your laser cannon breaks it in two. A hit on one of these breaks it into two smaller asteroids, a final hit on a small asteroid destroys it completely. Your ship is equipped with a special defensive option to help you avoid collisions when the action gets intense!\n\nSpace Rocks is an impressive blending of the classic arcade games Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe, crafted for the Atari 2600 by Darrell Spice, Jr. If you're a fan of either arcade cabinet (or both!), you'll love Space Rocks! While Atari's version of Asteroids for the 2600 was passable at the time of its release, Space Rocks blasts far ahead of this early effort. Taking full advantage of the DPC+ mode in our Melody Board, Space Rocks pushes the Atari 2600 to its limits and offers a wide variety of gameplay options to keep you playing for years to come. The graphics, animations, and sound effects are well above what is typically experienced on the 2600.","Publisher":"AtariAge"},"33260":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mark R.

Players take on the role of the Duke boys driving the infamous \"General Lee,\" while trying to avoid the police and rescue their sister Daisy from Boss Hogg. While development of this game was reportedly complete, it was not commercially released (and thus it never recieved a packaging design, official instruction manual, etc).\n\nDukes of Hazzard is not really a prototype. The game was actually burned onto regular ROM chips that were just about to be put into carts and shipped when Atari abruptly decided to cancel the game. According to the programmer Mark Hahn the game was still being worked on, so it is a mystery as to why Atari would go through the expense of manufacturing ROM chips. It appears that Dukes of Hazzard may have been the victim of internal Atari territoriality. According to Hahn he and his group were stationed in New York, while the bulk of Atari's programming staff was located in California. Apparently the California group didn't give the New York group much help or guidance and they were sort of forced to wing it.\n\nInterestingly, this wasn't Atari's first attempt at a Dukes of Hazzard game. Atari had previously attempted to rework the graphics in the unreleased game Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard type game. It's unknown why Atari abandoned the Stunt Cycle version, but it may be because it was too outdated by the time it was ready for release. This may explain why Atari was so eager to get this Dukes of Hazzard game out the door as quickly as possible (or perhaps Atari's use of the license was about to expire). Either way, the game was never released.","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OAMrBHh0YR8"},"33261":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c3a055ca-3211-44fe-83bd-79abfd3b23a9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e1f4b00d-6835-41ec-8c1b-58b17789bad9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e1c1f5e8-c450-4192-aae7-f444401ca65e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e443fb86-eae3-4a39-b6c5-fe8b68d4d9de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dukes of Hazzard 2","Overview":"This is another prototype with the Dukes of Hazzard name.

The goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, the player moves on to the next round and is given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:\n\n    Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, the player will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.\n\n    Marching Blocks: In this game, each time the player catches a fireball, the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.\n\n    Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that the player needs to destroy.\n\n    Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move. Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.\n\n    Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation. When the player destroys enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.","Publisher":"Arcadia Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q5mNd-kU-fA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fireball_(video_game)"},"34327":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Answer Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4def29a7-4eaf-41a7-9573-cd8e8101a17a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"56e05aaf-28fc-47be-b7b8-93125087d063.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4d9bd2d1-e198-4042-ba5e-0aabe7618d4a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"128f48b9-7b01-40a3-8594-08bed96bbaa9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"506f129c-3205-474b-a408-e068db4be77a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b68737ee-3c41-4d2c-bfb8-382327e70c34.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"f862725a-6196-4831-b984-50b537213ca5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"981a0ec3-6fd6-414d-8c56-4f9b3cacfaac.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1be261f6-0535-45ae-878f-068e29dac2dc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fa13311b-f434-4a67-a6c9-4d5f3034ccb2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"323afcae-f4db-4d5e-891d-335be374a9ca.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gauntlet","Overview":"This game has nothing to do with the Atari arcade game or any of the home-ported versions.\n\nYou are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom.

You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.","Publisher":"Starpath Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=33Xvt-RbQlc"},"34329":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Paris Attack","Region":"Europe"},{"Name":"Angriff der Luftflotten","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Western Technologies Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b16e626c-634c-40e4-ba84-fe2ecda55359.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"979d7d0c-b2c1-4e9e-ab95-dd9b02289e21.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f7dde68e-954f-41e2-a3fc-cf252cc9d244.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"542a4f39-8020-4990-af4c-1798d48cc3b1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e44b4161-68dd-422a-b960-a76531d02345.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6ee8f4d7-1fb5-49ff-bc8a-e7c7723531a9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"bcaaff39-c636-43f9-94b5-4145bdf60ddc.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fb1a7deb-1bc8-4ca9-b190-1fbce4a8f12f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"486781df-a15b-478a-a6da-f162f42ad17c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"337a0740-9a5f-4a8f-a66b-8a37b5bc40a1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"0ac8d3fc-3d95-41f6-a156-b757140b2b6e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"47df81b3-e5bd-4e64-8906-800e5da56326.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ce112f38-d1aa-4eae-81a4-8ef4e1ded700.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3c0e345e-866f-4125-bbb7-418fc44d5120.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"af21f479-b3ed-4559-9da2-f8b96b816cba.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"432e31a0-e756-418e-af33-416648c8d0b8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"68f97d5e-a4b0-4314-8415-74398f4c5f39.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"M.A.D.","Overview":"M.A.D.

The game was originally programmed back in 1983, but was never commercially released due to ownership changes at Atari. This game requires the use of the Kid's Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.\nA version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid's Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. You can purchase a copy of Holey Moley by visiting Atari2600.com.\n\nHoley Moley is a port of a rare 1982 arcade game by Tai. According to Bob Polaro, the game was shelved due to the change in management at Atari.

It is the first video game to be based on the James Bond film series.\n\nPlayers control British spy James Bond in his multi-purpose vehicle that can travel both land and sea. Players can shoot lasers upward towards aerial opponents or bullets downwards at other enemies. They must also jump over obstacles and dodge enemy attacks.\n\nThere are four missions, each based on a Bond movie. The missions are: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Before each mission begins, the game displays its name, lives remaining, the vehicle, and a message from M stating, \"Good luck, Mr. Bond.\" Each mission has a specific goal, with various checkpoints throughout.\n\nWhen a player's last life is lost, M bids James goodbye, and the final score is shown.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player also received a double-0 rating based on the difficulty of play (novice or agent), and how well the player did.

Instead, you have a screen with nine horizontal levels. There are dots, candies, if you will, on each level. You must eat all the candies to get a teeth brushing and advance to the next, harder, level. Also on the levels are happy faces. They are happy to knock your teeth out, which they will do if you touch them. This will lose you a life. When all lives are lost, the game is over.\n\nThree times per level, a vitamin pill will appear in the center of the screen. If you eat this, the faces will turn red, allowing you to eat them for a short time. The faces will flash red and white, briefly, before returning to normal, as a warning.

You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden. If you disturb the monster, it will continuously chase you unless you can lead it back into one of the caves located in the corners of the screen.\n\nThis game's name was changed from Lochjaw to Shark Attack because, being the game was about an attacking shark, there was a lawsuit that the game's name was too close to the movie title Jaws.","Publisher":"Apollo","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=umiFl4NcbZk"},"34919":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"39c3c306-f9ab-4ddf-9d97-53a735d5778a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6988be8a-3e68-49f1-b500-b5fd49f624a1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6ccfa0fb-1b76-4620-a656-2124e1d0151b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a205f45b-8704-48aa-8eae-41400735cc92.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"814370e5-4ceb-4eb1-8629-008427eeb053.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ac634707-a496-4244-abb2-b41593d42f55.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"22a32267-da90-4c25-8fa3-ee8d110ab040.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"77088559-caa7-4c6a-a3d1-14a14ff11b37.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"London Blitz","Overview":"During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare.

The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.'

One copy of Venture II sold at the CGE2K1 auction and went for over $200.

Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner). The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!","Publisher":"Starpath Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x8LJKCpSJSw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phaser_Patrol"},"90935":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Xonox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6cf35321-24dc-4832-9ee4-1c8387c12b65.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2b685f47-7dc1-4118-a60b-13b66527e464.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a01c1e1-f058-49cb-8ad7-083268583283.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5a783407-97bd-4634-af1e-560852f0a313.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d4f181af-cee2-4225-b716-40676ef536c7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Xonox Double Ender: Artillery Duel\/Chuck Norris Superkicks","Overview":"Artillery Duel is a two player game of skill and strategy as you try to knock out your enemy's gun emplacement.

Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.\n\nAs the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.\n\nTo deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.\n\nTo win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.\n\nIn two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.\n\nDifficulty switches\nLeft switch for the robot, right for the monsters.\nSet to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.\n\nGame variations\n1P=one player\n2P=two player\nS=spare parts needed for spare robot\nF=mine levels flood, slowing you down if you enter the water.\n-T=cannot drop bombs in flooded areas\n+T=can drop bombs in flooded areas\nI-mines are invisible except when monsters are exploding by time bomb\n\nGame 1 1P; S=3; F-T\nGame 2 2P; S=3; F-T\nGame 3 1P; S=6; F-T\nGame 4 2P; S=6; F-T\nGame 5 1P; S=3\nGame 6 2P; S=3\nGame 7 1P; S=2; F-T\nGame 8 2P; S=2; F-T\nGame 9 1P; S=3; F+T\nGame 10 1P; S=3; F+T\nGame 11 1P; S=3; F+T; I\nGame 12 2P; S=3; F+T; I\n\nScoring\nDestroy a monster=20 points\nPick up robot part=70 points\nDeposit robot part=lose 70 points\n\n\nEvery 1000 points scored up to 4000 raises your power level by one unit.","Publisher":"CommaVid","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ud9L9HxiMAg"},"95748":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"a3769e67-7713-4033-acf4-84d5d30e135c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"827fc733-7662-447d-9544-6a982c2c3cde.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eea2a14e-1500-4426-a65c-812c8d0566bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"87bc72b6-90a7-472b-8586-6d802b62b128.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"27e516de-f3b0-4a59-b878-b5444a4aa40d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c0ffc4f-ed60-4d34-be50-4b7c0d73755e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11465214-c691-405b-9ccb-4903405b3d79.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a2207ba5-b5e7-4295-9ec7-0d41efc69123.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b82a7f94-e74c-481d-9f51-62e3801960be.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4168ff81-8f17-4cce-8b75-e3918c8359c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Miss Piggy's Wedding","Overview":"Miss Piggy's Wedding was a two-player game created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 console. The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.\n\nThe object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.\n\nThe obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.\n\nThe most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NVY-7KQk3us"},"95784":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Answer Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ba5763cd-5557-4287-8a4d-7d85b1d8e349.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7459adfc-5bbe-4644-aba8-145b7dab5c6d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"11241162-72de-4c89-8cd0-6e4c197e5e0e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6c9ce041-0fe8-4711-bc0d-bd609e1e1089.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"cd277192-f3ac-43e3-a6bd-f86afedf158f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7ee564e-7de4-4e2e-9590-e96792351e24.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"08950bdb-19ff-4c18-ba99-2ddcd903bad2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f07908bc-b2ff-452a-9999-04ae2de4a30a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"822da64d-b3d1-4db6-b117-fdbee6b01ea5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"22f49998-b4d3-46f7-9a5b-f873addee92e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"be017695-2625-434c-af13-7242e6e20569.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Malagai","Overview":"You are Commander Harrington \"Harry\" Crag of the starship \"Endless Search\".

On the right, a paddle (said to be a container of aphrodisiac \"Spanish Fly\" in the manual) returns the depleted bachelor to the room full of women. The paddle is controlled by the player using a paddle controller.\n\nThe premise is that of an unnamed bachelor having his final fling with a room full of inexplicably nude women. The equally unclothed bachelor is propelled repeatedly into the room of women by a container of \"Spanish Fly\" used as the player's paddle. When entering the fray, the bachelor's exaggerated and pixelated penis is seen to be erect. When he returns from having collided with (and presumably had sexual intercourse with) a woman or after hitting the opposing wall, his penis sags. It returns to erect when the bachelor is successfully set moving again toward the left.\n\nA second version of the game, titled Bachelorette Party, also exists. It has no difference in gameplay, but has the game sprites reversed: The player now uses his or her paddle to bounce a naked woman toward naked men.","Publisher":"PlayAround","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TVx_z3qYVAM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bachelor_Party_(video_game)"},"96227":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cat N Mouse","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"UA Limited","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8dd950c1-4cf6-4895-a640-cbe84a7801c9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f8443380-9a5c-4cc2-ae82-8ffdc106fc3d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"13702e9f-2d3c-4ca9-809f-8fec85c5ef8e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fc9f98fe-2194-4b3a-ba6f-4f40e0ea5c02.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f89abdfc-87f7-4505-9f36-30fe247b871e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ad026aaa-2ce4-4cdc-9b21-34f1041e9113.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cf010cd5-9ac6-400d-a346-972486877afc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fd2ca869-96c5-47c4-a4ef-57e07404d069.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b2aa2a54-a03c-407a-bc13-4fcff3d1a07f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cat Trax","Overview":"It's an age-old battle of cats versus dogs.

You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.\n\nElk Attack is a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published. The game was left in its current state.\n\nThe following is hidden in the code: ELK ATTACK (c) 1987 Mark R.

An even earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show.  Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now.  Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. \n\nThe game has nice, clean graphics.  The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad.  Each frog even has its own realistic \"ribbet\" sound.  The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue.  Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out.  The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B).  There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions.  You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit.  Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects.  There are five types of insects.  \n\nThe game subject and total lack of difficulty shows this game was going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds. This and the fact that it looked almost identical to Mattel's Frogs and Flies could have been the reason it was eventually not released.\n\nThe cart, (green) box and manual are reproductions from 2004.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kTIPSkilaWI"},"96259":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Cathouse Blues","Region":"Australia"},{"Name":"Bachelor Party: Gigolo","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mystique","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"c5433134-3e35-425d-a0ee-b9f7283c59bb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"bb95fc10-56be-4fbc-9a1e-7754aea6cd49.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"eebe578a-cac5-44d6-9b83-5c5f767c8bcc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"56f91133-6376-4d4d-b8e9-8cc310486af9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e942b69a-1e86-4b6d-957e-ae441e9b929e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"750a5f99-0283-4c6d-85d8-a0f35ef03e6a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"88003467-a4d4-4d10-b2af-851ad7c9fc47.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3192fabe-ace9-4e2f-b109-c47fe219c6b3.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"56bae0df-edc9-4b7f-8ea5-f02dc52774c6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aceb1aeb-4847-4eaa-92eb-56fe302850f8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"524d616b-f8f0-4646-88f3-4862d99c0552.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gigolo","Overview":"This was a double-ended cartridge that contained Bachelor Party on one end and a new game, Gigolo, on the other.\n\nIn Gigolo, men will leave the jail and head to various houses.

Magical items you find along the way will help you in your quest.","Publisher":"Starpath Corporation","ReleaseYear":1983},"98707":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Miner 2049er: Starring Bounty Bob","Region":"North America"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Big Five Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a1d35fd8-9d7e-468c-bf95-e66a603137ce.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a092d5cc-5f3c-4283-897c-40684b3acf89.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"88cb0e15-03ad-4e10-8a28-6f28758bafc4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5e47c57a-bcfb-4bd7-8eee-0c90274714fd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1ca0dd78-3e08-4795-977f-fb53fdfbe1d3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d3a69eec-47c5-4899-84db-ee364d077a81.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3e065f52-fcd8-4677-a235-471ac59d74e1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"911f064a-4d52-40de-8eac-d31ce40b301a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"de06bd7c-c250-4942-bfd3-a424f5c67dd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"85830571-9dcb-4e96-8c1c-a236127419e6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Miner 2049er","Overview":"You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there.\n\nYou can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed.\n\nThere is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.","Publisher":"Tigervision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2PdPWhvBilg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Miner_2049er"},"99109":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Sweat! - The Decathalon Game","Region":"United States"},{"Name":"Sweat!

According to Woita, Garfield still needed about 2 to 3 months of work before it would be complete.

The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen.

To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.\n\nKabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalog. No instruction manual was ever made for it and the game was never released. Only one prototype is known to exist, assumably from programmer Rex Bradford himself. According to Bradford: 'What happened was that I \"finished\" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it. I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted.

This unique insect game is a mix of tennis and volleyball where bees hit a honey ball over a net using a racquet. A bee judge watches over the match and serves new balls as needed. If the ball touches the floor or flies out of bounds, a point is scored. Avoid fouling the ball out, use your dexterity to block your opponent's shots, slam the ball to score, learn new tactics to outwit your opponent, and you could be the next Bee-Ball champion!\n\nIn the competitive sport of Bee-Ball, you must score 10 points against your opponent to win a match. You can swing at the ball to send it flying over to the net or block when your opponent is trying to get the ball past you. If the ball is about to fly over your head, you can head butt the ball in an attempt to prevent a point from being scored against you! Points are scored if the ball touches the floor or the ball flies out of bounds, but in order to score you must first successfully serve.\n\nBee-Ball supports single and two player play modes. In single-player mode, you compete against a challenging AI computer opponent. In two-player mode you can compete head-to-head against a friend!","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NF_zz7pPv2Q"},"109835":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chad Lare","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"02bf15f5-3711-42a9-858e-6b19707180b6.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b324d5a7-92a6-40f0-b6a1-4ad7e8dcc05b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8707c6a1-f455-442c-a4d6-acf162d0a4b9.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a199bc9b-afe3-43d7-a54c-a37b15e72f1c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1b683c80-aad9-4fc6-b7f3-543d0097ab71.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e7bc7a43-4572-40f9-979d-0a9d39e876d0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Backfire","Overview":"The year is 2947.

You can see nine yards of the playing field at any time--when you go beyond one edge of the field, your player wraps around to the opposite edge, showing another nine yard segment of the field. The game is comprised of four 15-second quarters. On the fourth down you can optionally kick the ball instead of running it.\n\nIn addition to the default \"classic mode\" display (which shows red players against a black field), you can switch to an enhanced, more colorful display by pressing the SELECT switch during gameplay. BLiP Football is a two-player game, with the game controller swapped back and forth between possessions.","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2006,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=egsqTZI4eK0"},"109838":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"David Crane","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"5c75fe5a-ab5b-4ed2-83ce-43abc3a06c46.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f951f2cf-cc1c-43f8-a11e-5eb02e0b040a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7dea7da2-8fca-472b-9b15-ea20de26ec3b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97b652c1-df45-4f76-9533-9c9652b96bdc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"65d1501d-e85d-4a0c-aefc-88f19c274357.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"667d95a2-c0cc-4b16-a12a-975ba33c54d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"da805f3a-dcea-470a-9a51-ee17b26f2306.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"86425c8c-4d09-4fd6-983b-735cd511ab73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Boggle","Overview":"Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari.

Who could forget those chubby little dolls that started fist fights between middle aged housewives in toy stores?  For some reason every kid had to have one of these creepy little kewpie dolls back in the 80's, although the fad eventually faded.  Since Cabbage Patch Kids just happened to be manufactured by Coleco, it was only natural that they would create a video game tie in.  While the Colecovision version of Cabbage Patch Kids was released to much success, the Atari 2600 version never materialized.\n\nIf you're scratching your head as to how someone could create a game based on a line of dolls, you're not alone.  Dolls don't exactly inspire video games.  However Coleco got around this by taking an existing game for the MSX line of computers called Athletic Land and adding the Cabbage Patch Kids into the game.  Since the MSX computer was never released in the US, people were none the wiser.  This is also why a game that was supposedly aimed at children seems so damn hard.\n\nCabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park (which will be henceforth referred to as CPK) is a side scrolling action game.  According to the Colecovision version's manual, Anna Lee has decided to go out for some exercise in the local park and is soon caught up in a wild adventure (hence the subtitle Adventures in the Park).  The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome.  Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires.  Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out.  Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win.\n\nCPK was known to exist for some time thanks to an interview conducted with another former Coleco programmer Ed English several years ago.  Ed was thought to be in possession of the only known prototype, but he would not release it for unknown reasons.  However in 2008 several Coleco EPROMs were found in a flea market, several of which contained various versions of CPK.  These EPROMs were released to the public shortly afterwards.\n\nWhile it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of CPK is an amazing feat of programming.  Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games.  It appears that CPK was simply a victim of the collapsing game market, and by the time the final version was ready in September of 1984, Coleco had stopped its 2600 operations.","Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1v1GhGQnQOo"},"109841":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Steve Engelhardt","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9c443b64-8ae3-479e-9607-a4ed53f67bf3.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"227be45e-87d8-4451-96e3-c626cfbde713.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"da336f76-4e3b-4be8-8e9c-910504b9a7c3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"22d6a684-2438-4f8d-8aa0-4a160346e765.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"430b907e-b3a2-4964-ab97-f7b1bd21b0c6.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4fe65369-43f4-4169-b59e-490b92dfc8ff.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e8231e1d-7b45-40c7-8028-dbeda6826236.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cave In","Overview":"The objective of Cave In is to find the three pieces of a crown somewhere within the maze of caverns.  Your Indiana Jones-like avatar searches through many brick-lined rooms looking for three keys that will open up the locked rooms.  There is an enemy (scorpion, hawk, wolf, etc,) to be dealt with in almost every room, and they can drain your strength if you come into contact with them.  There are three difficulty settings: normal, intermediate and fast.  Only the first version starts you off with a revolver to defend yourself and has static key locations.  I was able to find the three keys in the normal version, but still was only able to open two doors.  Once you open a door and kill the enemy in these rooms, it triggers a booby trap of falling bricks that must be avoided.  The crown pieces are guarded by a boss figure.  It doesn’t appear that the rooms have to be done in any specific order, so I am stumped as to what it takes.  I have not gotten very far in the harder versions.  I got caught up in trying to solve the normal version.\n\nAmong the many graphic features: a transport room, medicine packs for slight replenishment, a sinkhole for fully restoring health, a shield for some protection, lava rooms with walls that are harmful, a dark maze that is visible only by torchlight, a rail car that you can ride across a room (if you avoid the falling rocks), and a rolling boulder.\n\nI was able to get in and out of the dark room from the top, but I never found another exit.  Somehow (at least I think so), I found an additional room and also a way into the dark room from the bottom.  There is also another hidden room that can be found by falling through a hole that must have some significance.  The graphics are quite nice and extensive for the system and all walls shake when you touch them for a little drama.  The sound is OK.  The challenge involved in trying to solve the game is addictive and makes for good replay value.\n\nCave In is a 32K cartridge.  It is AtariAge’s first Atari 2600 homebrew that they have published with additional on­board RAM, doubling the amount of RAM available to the game!  This memory in Cave In uses the same SARA \"SuperChip\" technology Atari developed for some of their more advanced games, including Crystal Castles, Jr. Pac-Man, and Stargate.  The programmer, Steve Engelhardt, utilized the programming language Batari BASIC (and some assembly language routines) to create the game.","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2010},"109842":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John W.

The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom). If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there. Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nKanggaroo, Quickstep.","Publisher":"Imagic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fz65UQ4WnwI"},"117450":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"U.S. Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6c426086-3164-4341-84da-d9c3ac7d0038.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"290ac0b1-5219-466d-9aed-b90915f7555d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d672233f-8871-48eb-948a-97b9c552cc47.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1f28bd79-6190-441e-ae3c-861e42108366.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"09c0e723-b074-4fcd-a719-d240d671bcd4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3a3a8fe4-2729-4c62-9037-bd10e2b3157f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c848bf3d-f684-4a3b-a903-87ce88b9ee8c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f847bba7-e1e8-46d4-8d58-4b47b798ab80.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"64eb4b47-9afa-4b81-897b-4500b02bcd50.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Raft Rider","Overview":"In Raft Rider you are floating down a river on a raft made out of logs.

From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii. Unfortunately, the only prototype that has surfaced is far from complete. It is little more than a movement demo, although bits of leftover code indicate that other features were planned such as being able to fire bullets and something that had to do with rocks. Unfortunately variable names (BULLETR and DNROCK) are all that remains of these. It's hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good. After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.","Publisher":"Apollo","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hj_9EnYxqvU"},"122359":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Spider Monster","Region":"Europe"},{"Name":"Spider Kong","Region":"Germany"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"K-Tel Vision","Images":[{"FileName":"ab09300c-a1e1-43f8-827d-f2480f4f470a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"98e4ac58-6864-4ebd-8c52-8f3eedb43c91.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6c9ea7e0-281e-4081-b8de-a8ab61ca5adb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0df61d9f-a043-4040-b01e-2f5395def1cc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f912a765-9266-47bf-b580-fd569a5f2ca0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Spider Maze","Overview":"This rare game from K-Tel Vision was probably sold exclusively in Canada.

The joystick can be used to raise and lower the blinds by pushing up or down. When the blinds are raised a nicely done sunset is visible out the window. \n\nThe story behind the Venetian Blind demo is rather interesting. As most people know, Activision was founded by several ex-Atari employees who had left due to Atari's policies on programmer recognition (or the lack thereof). One of these employees was Bob Whitehead, creator of the \"Venetian Blinds\" technique, which was first used in Atari's Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the normal six. Even though Activision had never used the Venetian Blinds technique in any of their games, that didn't stop Atari from threatening to sue Activision for \"stealing\" the technique along with other various proprietary information. \n\nSince Activision knew that they hadn't stolen anything from Atari, they decided to play a little joke on Atari. According to David Crane, when the Atari's lawyers questioned them about the \"stolen\" Venetian Blinds technique David showed them this demo and said \"Is this what you guys are referring to?\". Apparently Atari wasn’t in a laughing mood, and they went through with the lawsuit. In the end Atari ended up losing the case and Activision went on to become the most successful of the 2600 third party companies. \n\nAlthough Activision never made a game out of this demo it didn't go completely to waste.

Video Chess is the game that led Atari to first invent bank-switched ROMs for the Atari 2600, even though the shipping version of the game wouldn't use the technique and was only 4K in size.\n\nThis is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.\n\nTo castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.\n\nAnother maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.\n\nSkill levels\nThese determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.\nLevel 1=15 seconds\nLevel 2=30 seconds\nLevel 3=45 seconds\nLevel 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds\nLevel 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds\nLevel 6=12 minutes\nLevel 7=10 hours\nLevel 8=10 seconds\n\nLevel 8 is a beginner level.","Publisher":"Atari,Inc.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1979,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0TiEhP1dYoQ"},"128393":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ellis, Kim","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"e389046e-9566-46cb-95e9-4c5b350a52c0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0a58092a-afb6-4072-bd1a-be0f9354d435.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45341555-7d21-4bb6-bd0e-4f4c12c41163.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0568d47f-46d4-4430-b0ec-bb11b6db966f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e793273d-5c9c-4b52-b57c-7ed968b627fc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9cbae70b-243a-4a24-b7da-7cd42a85e47f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"beaddea4-ea4e-4fb2-bfa3-184b5496693c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8d319660-17db-4d2b-b1dd-d4dbf5fd0eff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d0c36eae-b35c-4377-979a-25cc45d46d46.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Confrontation","Overview":"Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.

The screen displays a group of monsters doing what appear to be Jumping Jacks.  At the bottom of the screen is a blue blob (which is assumed to be Cookie Monster) holding a spotlight.  Pressing the # or * buttons on the Kids Controller will cause Cookie Monster to move left or right, and when you get underneath a monster the spotlight will shoot a beam and highlight the monster.  Once the monster is highlighted, you can control his (its?) head, arms, or legs by pressing the the keys on the keypad.  Each body part seems to have two different actions (three if you count not doing anything).  The head can blink or nod up and down, the arms can either flap or pump up and down, and the legs can kick out or squat.  After awhile the whole thing begins to look like a creepy exercise video, which may be where the name came from. \n\nAccording to the copyright message this game is part of the Children's Computer Worshop series (the Sesame Street series), but its part number CX-26131 and late copyright date 1984 are well outside the Children's Series range. Atari may have been planning some kind of series for young children and infants in order to reach as wide an audience as possible. There is evidence of this as prototypes for other children's games such as Peek-A-Boo and Honker Bonker fall into this part number range. This prototype even uses the Kid's Controller, which further supports this theory. In 1984 the videogame industry was crashing fast and Monstercise was probably scrapped due to lack of a market for such a game, or even possibly because of the gameplay was too similar to Grover's Music Maker (which was also not released). It's unknown if any more work was ever done on this title.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u--Ag4e0ikA"},"128400":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"The Music Machine"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Christian Software Development","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"161bd17d-9f07-4c92-86e7-5ab6d0a550dc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"08ac4409-b63e-4164-a250-6be624d15103.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3f969262-19ee-48bd-bc1f-6370183f9f1a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92876821-567c-4545-a99a-ee2461952f1c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9aacf5d7-d179-4ea6-9c0e-0b8c3c9c2c99.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d16932a5-d882-4dd8-9cea-79999a45a8d6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5abe1398-ca78-43d3-b16c-4c2583c283da.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0f23a4a7-824e-4689-ba2f-919110c74738.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1087d3bc-e605-45f7-9557-d4eadb4ec084.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Music Machine","Overview":"In this game, you play as Stevie and Nancy.\n\nThe Music Machine moves back and forth at the top of the screen, dropping symbols that represent good qualities (Fruits of the Spirit).

And it's a lot of fun. The objective is to repeat the color and sound patterns - using Joyboard or Joystick - that Rockin' Rollie creates on the screen.\n\nOff Your Rocker can also be played using a Joystick instead of the Joyboard.\n\nUse the Game Select level to choose the number of players (number will appear in upper left-hand score box.) Pressing the Joystick's \"fire\" button will tell Rockin' Rollie that you're ready to play. When he presents a pattern, you can take as long as you like to study it and make your first move. But once you have started, you only have five seconds between each following move. There are two ways to play:\n\n1. When the Left Difficulty Switch is in the A\/Novice position, each player remains on The Joyboard or uses the Joystick until they fail to complete the pattern (at which point Rockin' Rollie will get a little on-screen surprise). The score is noted and the next player can take a turn on The Joyboard or the Joystick and a completely new pattern will begin.\n\n2. When the Left Difficulty Switch is in the B\/Expert position, Off Your Rocker is played as a round-robin game. The first player gets on The Joyboard or uses the Joystick and repeats the pattern. The next player then takes their turn. Any player who is unsuccessful will be removed from the rotation. The score will flash to indicate whose turn it is.\n\nThe Right Difficulty Switch does not affect game play. In either mode, after the 7th round, the patterns will get faster.\n\nRockin' Rollie's pattern sequenced can be up to 99 color changes in length. If you somehow manage to complete the entire sequence of 99 (or get even close to it), you will probably have worked up quite a sweat. You might want to consider a shower before you start bragging about how well you've done.\n\nBefore leaving the VCS arena, Amiga had sent its second game Off Your Rocker off to a company to have labels applied. Unfortunately, since Amiga had pulled the plug on its 2600 division, they didn't have the money to pay for labels, so the carts were kept by the label company. Years later the company sold the cartridges off as scrap to a company in Ohio called Pleasant Valley Video who slapped on a homemade, handwritten label and sold them to the 2600 community.","Publisher":"Amiga Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5tn-SKqeP5k"},"128402":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Avalon Hill","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c16738eb-aa3a-4b6c-a7e4-6c98d454c2dd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6ddd63af-bd49-492a-a403-2d3edc21c854.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"908511e2-7b6a-4715-a516-0c5f208c624b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ff518475-783b-485f-b285-700e435a86f9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a83ce645-58c2-4a80-a465-d21eb446bb9b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e9ae2959-c1d4-4817-a402-20ded4619992.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"84178aa1-ac6d-4054-ac2a-95588b4235f7.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4993bd77-bbf0-4ee6-b9fa-acb2c990b4d2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Out of Control","Overview":"This is an obstacle race in a space ship.

Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.

Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nnUiwy0EQ7M","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Q*bert%27s_Qubes"},"128413":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dan Oliver","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"08d9ae6d-9130-4abf-a091-bd895cda57a4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"cbd90e8f-9897-40aa-bb9e-3697ad418587.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2b0d7e72-4c58-4724-8c3a-6796ae0ba674.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a6128584-d8eb-4faa-998a-bca91205549b.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"61174305-d2be-47a3-bc0c-33e7bbf24648.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"18cd70e9-fad0-4f5a-88e7-5e209e1249fb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"80be9d65-74c3-49dd-bb6b-d543fca900f1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e32b405d-3c5d-4a15-a969-de428c94894f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cdedff20-2606-49a9-af9b-db936eeaad85.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rescue Terra I","Overview":"Terra I supplies Earth with Zenbar crystals, which is used to supply 72% of the power to Earth.

Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.\n\nYou can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.\n\nIn the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together.

The two stages alternate and become faster over time.","Publisher":"ITT","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"128427":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ski Run","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Suntek","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"bbdcc76f-7413-4767-ad58-2bd0cc5574ab.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5e0f7d43-aac5-4c47-ad97-75aa12301532.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a7711292-6f35-450f-b315-8ed1677e2e8e.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e6a5fa42-1ada-47f4-b7d2-0454686f19c5.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4b7e5450-cd22-4f60-8fbb-7b49f521f827.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ski Run","Overview":"An downhill skiing game where player must avoid obstacles on the ski run with further distances earning higher scores.","Publisher":"Suntek","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9XzZ_mFK32c"},"128428":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nintendo R&D1","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"c4cd5b01-2a59-42d5-9c46-28dd2aebcc44.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0ef45a67-4ba7-4a4e-a57b-0c18f725fa2a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"56ab5b8e-54b1-42b5-a5a4-e66d8ff0c2de.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"864905ce-09a7-4118-94ee-31a0a56c27e0.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1c6ae9d7-bb57-497d-8a9f-dbcd410b1044.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"189edf95-aa5a-4ad9-a235-6178170dadb7.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8626b7ba-13e3-4406-bccf-547be19a7440.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"01fb54ff-3761-402b-9546-13f15746632a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sky Skipper","Overview":"It's a high-flying, action-packed adventure!

It was once thought that Spinning Fireball, along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief, were all original games developed by a PAL company called Suntek.  However after much research it has been determined that these are in fact original NTSC games released by two different companies called Zimag and Vidco, which may have been related somehow.  So why were these games developed for the NTSC market but never released?  Read on to find out.\n\nSpinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.\n\nThe controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level. \n\nWhile Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).\n\nWhile it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.","Publisher":"Zimag","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/tqnsOeQwTQI?t=5"},"128462":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"KC Munckin"},"128463":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"Kwibble"},"128464":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"McDonald's: Golden Arches Adventure","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dave Engman","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e85a4673-72e9-43e1-9dbb-132eb33d6029.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3c20a012-d594-4dba-b38d-7abe8dbb9019.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c40586d-be4e-4038-b7ee-b7e3e61f485e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c396cf0b-6fbd-4f38-b5e6-a231eee03f1c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"06787d58-98a8-4322-a55d-0d972cd33ccf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b9e6fce1-4051-4e59-bcab-067fbfe220fb.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"abbceca5-dd53-475c-aec1-3180c71cb5fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"865d709d-905a-45d3-9edd-4ae105e2585a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"McDonald's","Overview":"The existing prototype uses the Tutankham game code.

Atari decided to contract the programming of the game to Roklan who had recently done Crazy Climber for them. Although the game was finalized and given to Atari, they ultimately decided not to publish it. There's no concrete explanation as to why this was, but there may have been some concerns about the gameplay not being as polished as it should be. Earlier versions of the game had a referee who would run up and down the side of the court calling fouls (his graphics are still in the game code, just like at least one player animation and an Atari logo that isn't used), but was taken out due to lack of space. The referee can be seen in early promotional shots of the game, so the decision to remove him must have been made quite late. While RealSports Basketball is an improvement over the Atari's classic Basketball game, it was too little too late. Obviously Atari had some doubts about this title, but it remained on Atari's schedule until late fall of 1983 meaning that they may have been reconsidering releasing it. In the end they decide not to.\n\nAlthough technically speaking this is still a PAL game, the final version was meant to be released as a NTSC game.\n\nThe silver cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2002 with permission of programmer Joe Gaucher.","Publisher":"Atari (USA)","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sgWj7ygSHDQ"},"128525":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zimag","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"1616349e-e646-49f3-b64b-62df3f6af230.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6860ee93-996f-417b-a8d3-53e2e92e3519.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f1db8f3b-a73e-48cf-8b4a-9a0755877e09.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c6bbd30b-f9d6-4cdd-a1f8-b172d68b3a29.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"711e0db1-8fa6-41cd-a47a-efc498191d6c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"95c630eb-ffa0-4bf5-8526-7dccc70445ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f5c90ba7-d068-4e97-9ff6-f715fa22deda.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pizza Chef","Overview":"At its heart, Pizza Chef a memory\/guessing game combined with a poorly programmed action game.

Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of \"Mind Reading\" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...\n\nMind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the \"correct\" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast...\n\nAfter choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the \"correct\" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the \"Race\" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also \"pass\" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card.\n\nThe current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the \"Cheat\" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mind Maze appears to have several options which can be set for each game.  The main screen lists four options: # of Choices (2, 3, or 4), Race\/No Race, Picture\/Color, and Past\/Future.  \n\n# of Choices\t- This sets the number of cards that appears on the screen.  The game defaults to two choices, but can be set as high as four.  Obviously the more choices there are, the harder the game becomes.\n\nRace\/No Race - This option is for setting up a two player \"race\" game.  The only visible effect this option seems to have is activating or deactivating the blue screen.  Setting the game to 'Race' causes the solid blue screen to appear between rounds, while setting it to 'No Race' skips this screen.\n\nPicture\/Color - This option affects the cards themselves.  Selecting 'Picture' will cause the game to display a series of beautiful pictures on the cards (everything from castles to goldfish), while selecting color will replace these pictures with a block of solid color.  When playing the 'Color' game, the picture actually hides behind one of the cards and is not visible to the player.  Selecting one of the cards will cause the picture to be revealed and the game will proceed to the next round (after awarding the appropriate points). \n\nPast\/Future - Out of all the options in the game, this one is the strangest.  As the name suggests this option affects the order in which players try to predict the cards (trying to guess the card that was just played or the card about to be played).  If set to Past the 2600 will select the \"correct\" card before the player chooses.  If the option is set to Future the 2600 will select the correct card as the player chooses.\n\nUnlike more advanced games such as Motorodeo, the player cannot actually change the game options directly.  Instead the player must keep selecting game numbers until the combination of rules he wants is found.  Since there are four different options (one with three choices), there are a whopping 24 different game variations in this prototype (3*2*2*2).  Not too shabby for a game from 1984.\n\nIf you haven't already noticed by the screenshots, the graphics in Mind Maze are absolutely gorgeous.  Each picture is large and well detailed (a rarity on the 2600).  The graphics also have a really cool 'Fade In' effect that adds a bit of eye candy to an otherwise drab looking game.  Excellent graphics in a game so early in the development cycle are rare, as the programmer usually put bland 'placeholder' graphics in until the gameplay was finished.  One has to wonder what other little surprises the programmer had in store for us.\n\nAlthough Mind Maze is constantly listed as being a Mindlink game, this prototype doesn't appear to use or require the strange controller.  However according to the programmers,  Mind Maze was definitely meant to be a Mindlink game.  Supposedly the headband was to read the players Alpha and Beta waves in an attempt to help predict their actions.  However since the Mindlink was really just a sensor that detected muscle movements in the players forehead, this was complete bunk.  The whole mind reading idea was just another angle thought up by Atari's marketing department.\n\nAlthough the theory behind Mind Maze was pretty far out there, it does show just how far Atari was willing to go to develop games for its new Mindlink controller.  Mind Maze was ultimately scrapped due to to the limited appeal of the \"game\" (or perhaps the marketing department finally stopped smoking those funny little cigarettes).  However Mind Maze would not be the last game to dabble in the paranormal, several years later another mind reading game called \"Taboo: The Sixth Sense\" was released for the NES.  Unfortunately this game was pretty much laughed off the store shelves and faded into obscurity.

Although this may sound rather easy, one has to keep in mind that the game was geared toward young children, so things had to be kept simplistic.\n\nCare Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull. Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped. According to programmer Laura Nikolich, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off, was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted. The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids. Although Nikolich described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983},"132271":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"64278e48-172a-4da7-b313-18cfc23cbcaa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c2502808-54c3-4ffe-8e2f-a2d21a04828c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"32380b57-b002-4ac9-9971-0fc3d3dde3b3.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4501fb8f-4740-489a-b5e8-d1d94460947a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"1373dbb8-ebf2-46f1-8b7c-8ad32f6f3a53.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aa970799-8776-4346-8588-7dcb06d7a7ee.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2be83a3d-740f-42c8-99d3-389b0e42f2bb.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Depth Charge","Overview":"Planned as a pack-in cassette title for Amiga's never released Power Module peripheral and described as 'the first machine-interactive video game', offering head-to-head play, with one player the submarine commander and the other the destroyer captain.

It's hard to believe that the 2600 can do a 3\/4th perspective shooting game, but Lasercade is the proof.  The goal of the game is to shoot all the targets in the upper section of the screen before time runs out (that's original).  However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. \n\nIn the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors.  As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful.  If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned.  However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round.  While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves.  The number of mirrors can be controlled with the left difficulty switch.","Publisher":"20th Century Fox \/ Fox Video Games","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q2VfUapQlco"},"132398":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Jeff Lorenz","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6a89569f-403a-4cb1-a3da-87c1cd0b76ea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"45a5fc10-2eab-4570-852d-93179eb404ec.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"74f4d12b-ac57-4237-80ac-69ca631c6982.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2bf4623-f560-4c83-b6ac-ec1ca46d9bb6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c0007eb6-65ad-4941-8cf0-147f6ca1432c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3496216a-cf4e-4564-bf9c-3eb2252fe5ac.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6fefc449-961d-4f5f-8b97-c2bad804af6b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ixion","Overview":"Ixion is a port of the unreleased 1983 Sega coin-op of the same name, Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else in the 2600 library. Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.\n\nIt is unknown why Ixion was never released by SEGA, but it was around this time that SEGA Enterprises (the American arm of SEGA) was sold to Bally. After this sale, all of SEGA's 2600 titles were Bally\/Midway arcade games (Tapper, Spy Hunter, and Up 'n Down). It may have been felt that only well known arcade game would sell well enough in the overly competitive 2600 market, or perhaps Ixion simply got lost in the transition shuffle.","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EP5TVqYM2ac"},"132868":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chris Read","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a3eadf29-b74d-4bce-a02a-e29212d2681c.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"01345468-6141-4ad9-999b-5965cabc3a9f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0787e143-2bd5-4262-8fb5-84216897c73c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alien Greed","Overview":"You were one of the first ones to reach Earth when you heard about the cool new LIMITED EDITION release of ALIEN GREED.

It's unknown why Looping was never released since the game seems to be finished and was even advertised. One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.\n\nAs the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect).  Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. \n\nThe cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2003.","Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k9CXsXkxOCw"},"133250":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"20th Century Fox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"8e641615-2a83-4acd-ad57-5da9f0162ae1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c636a77e-9bdb-4760-879e-c1292900f861.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"734cc10b-0988-4c96-963f-15a859fd7b79.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c66a3f17-7e23-40ab-8d25-0196305f2594.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"451017cf-45c7-4002-b20d-df95abbe87c5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"472d49bf-0b8b-4088-b142-30f85270a84d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Meltdown","Overview":"Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow!\n\nWhy 20th Century Fox decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market. The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting 'Just Released' had already been printed. Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed. Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.","Publisher":"20th Century Fox","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WjXXM-kWSWY"},"133251":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Abre-te, Sesamo!","Region":"Brazil"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bit Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"1663eb0f-d789-4b0f-a162-2834f8bb0504.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7c8711bf-4596-4c45-9bea-75ab4b7c5ec7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b306136a-c858-498f-9f51-1b2e9b588707.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc269697-4c27-40f6-a051-77def699e028.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0a172077-4889-404d-88ea-b5f336a5082a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c75baa7a-227d-40de-b97c-411500c94b1f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bdd3fe8d-8303-4af5-9aa2-488e6412fac8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6ed20a36-64a5-4b0e-8798-5dff435a3c8a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ed97151-92e6-4953-ac17-060eb2d4d37d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9a3f9e33-4bf1-4a4d-8bb6-d78fca7b6196.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Open Sesame","Overview":"Open, Sesame! is an action platform game.

Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard.

Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.\n\nOn the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.\n\nIn Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.\n\nIn the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":"2004-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aw60xJZzLVU"},"133255":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"625a07c6-4574-46e0-a299-66f287000184.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1230d678-e645-4ffc-b82e-de9b87981519.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eabb1364-66bd-42a2-8c1c-ae617d47b970.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9dc9fad0-2862-4ef9-9509-e14425cf2a28.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"79eb1d2c-e567-44d4-8288-5cea08671f90.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c40c5f6d-52ff-4e9d-817a-5bea31c169c1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0af0cfa3-6efe-4b2f-a225-8686934d1437.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Skindiver","Publisher":"Sancho","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"133257":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"O Túnel Espacial","Region":"Spain"},{"Name":"Space Robot","Region":"Finland"},{"Name":"Le Tunnel de L'Espace"},{"Name":"Tunnel de L'Espace, Le","Region":"France"},{"Name":"Le Tunnel de L'Estace","Region":"France"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"36f35e4f-a2b1-43c2-94e4-c3ea0a52ed6c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"f696fb89-0949-47d5-897c-cdc5178eb8c1.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0ad3be0c-2db6-4148-8690-4cc6a81fcf00.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"10058021-901e-4f3a-86f5-1226f7a6b6cd.png","Region":"Finland","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"772312d7-5a5e-4a7c-b7a4-9bb80348d908.png","Region":"Finland","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45b4cbe8-c91b-4a75-a4a5-fe59e54fbb26.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"171b8c81-910d-464d-99de-7fae205ab065.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1e813ca9-9c65-41e6-8375-56cb6af5b4ea.jpg","Region":"Finland","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1a584e1b-8d71-4d1c-a603-66ab5f270bd5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c3c5ab71-cd61-4c05-ae24-adb48b40b72d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9a88dfc4-ce4a-481f-9013-c5f2f3319b50.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f3cef96f-22cc-4fa0-949f-d245b8b09f7c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Space Tunnel","Overview":"In Space Tunnel\\Space Robot you fly at hyper speed to an unknown galaxy's center and encounter strange creatures.","Publisher":"Goliath","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RC-do-nJ3s0"},"133258":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f23b12cc-9d46-422b-9b25-34872f54ddb5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"995a03f0-df09-48c7-99d4-395d3e93139c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"80758339-e4dd-4dea-b74c-a5950e4f8e99.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"abe525dd-9ac3-4e6a-a433-0a73204402cc.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"af44a714-f37b-45f8-8aa3-832125c3f0f0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cbbbe58e-8484-4f95-835f-2f504720fc39.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Stone Age"},"133259":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tang's Electronic Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6327e61f-ed23-4c53-af3c-e6db94560c62.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4abaaac5-c95d-4042-b65c-684a8b81664f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"59748918-d4b7-4a72-837f-16a30323bff6.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"7cef7159-f96d-4a14-b357-2e7ab3ed3145.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fafb0b84-90b6-46b1-b73b-5355a41f9972.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"799e82c0-2c5e-4e73-a723-e324c4fec2ec.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"18d3cfad-4ec1-4e74-a304-530128abb0d1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bdf612ea-81f1-42a6-91df-13f6b50cc584.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Stunt Man","Overview":"Players take on the role of a stuntman who has to escape various dangers and make it to a flying helicopter.\n\nStuntman is broken down into three timed stages.

While the core gameplay is there, the prototype is missing some finishing touches such as correct level progression, the races starting automatically, and more tracks.

From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different.  Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay.  However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet...\n\nLooking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.  Like I said, this game is weird!.\n\nUnfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern.\n\nAs you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers.  These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation.  The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game.  The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number.  It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle.\n\nAlthough the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay.  Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke.  It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things.  Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot.  It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype.\n\nAlthough Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise.  Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat.  It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear.  Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.\n\nOnly one prototype of Kyphus is known to exist. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. A picture of the box was shown in a few Apollo advertisements. It appears to show a wizard battling evil clouds in a temple which is fairly close to the gameplay in the current prototype.\n\nHidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy and Invoke.

Wings features a fairly sophisticated control panel (for a 2600 game), containing seven different gauges that let you keep tabs on your fuel, power, airspeed, altitude, radar, horizon, and compass. \n\nTwo different versions of the prototype binary exist, one NTSC and one PAL. The NTSC version of the game is dated four months earlier than the PAL version, and is noticeably different. The NTSC version is playable, but is missing the enemy planes and has numerous bugs.

It was written by Atari 2600 homebrew developer Darrell Spice Jr. and released under his SpiceWare label in 2006. David Vazquez and Erik Ehrling provided graphics and music for the game, respectively. Warlords was first ported to the Atari 2600 in 1981 by game designer Carla Meninsky. Spice's version includes elements of the arcade version that were not included in the official 2600 port.\n\nMedieval Mayhem is an action game that features a king in each of the four corners of the screen. Each king is protected by a brick castle. The object of the game is to destroy the opponents' kings by breaking through the walls of the castle with a fireball. Up to four players can play simultaneously; each controls a shield in front of the castle. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining shields are controlled by the computer.\n\nAt the start of the game (and each round), a \"launch dragon\" appears and releases a fireball. As the game progresses, additional fireballs appear. A round is complete when three kings have been destroyed, leaving one remaining. The player with the surviving king wins the round, and a knight marches across the screen, carrying the banner of the winning player.","Publisher":"SpiceWare","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2006,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hR_B857oJo4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Medieval_Mayhem"},"146796":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John W.

(3) The invaders themselves are particularly tailored to provide an exciting 3-D effect on the ATARI VCS.\"","Publisher":"U.S. GAMES CORPORATION","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1982},"158096":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alex Leavens","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"87fc2171-c87f-4ba3-8c1f-7bddb1d98094.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a8581fd7-2466-4e16-b104-53218f4a0bd2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6f732eb3-b238-4bff-a7b7-f51fe78ba658.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bd6b7cf2-cc4a-4a33-b97f-e0f765ee4c15.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d2cf451f-1b08-451e-86c2-d4fdb021ae34.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"272ef361-1af6-4a24-a30e-426d24086216.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9c107da4-cd01-4473-a336-5169f50f3162.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c8573858-f52a-41f3-8aac-c1ee01b16110.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bouncin' Baby Bunnies","Overview":"Zounds! Coco the crazy monkey is in quite a pickle this time! Dr. Storkus Z. Hopperdropper (Storky, to his friends) has gone a bit mad, and is dropping baby bunnies from the sky! In fact, it's raining bunnies!\n\nWhat's a crazy monkey to do? Get help, that's what! Coco and his brother Haggis are out to catch the bunnies and bounce 'em to safety. It's monkey business, for sure, and they need your help, so grab that trampoline, and start Bouncin' Baby Bunnies!!\n\nA copy of the nearly complete game surfaced in the collection of a former Telesys employee in 2007. According to programmer Alex Leavens, Bouncin' Baby Bunnies is based off the old Bugs Bunny cartoon, where the stork mistakenly delivers Bugs to a gorilla family and they think he's their baby. The only known prototype of Bouncin' Baby Bunnies seems to be fairly complete, but still needs some tweaks and bug fixes. The game didn't get released because of the collapsing game market of 83\/84. According to the former Telesys employee: 'Bouncin' Baby Bunnies came too late in the 2600 cycle and, at the time, wasn't worth releasing. The market was saturated.'","Publisher":"Telesys","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LQjSkvdgtJk"},"158102":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Bachelor Party and Gigolo"},{"Name":"Bachelor Party \/ Gigolo"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Playaround, Mystique","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f717974c-8e98-4d82-a91e-ce7df737d544.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a0d2ca6f-41c0-4b63-8d1d-a2b8dde90a69.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1f01661b-c2c4-4510-9f47-b21374325675.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fc086938-c8e2-45d5-8230-8cde58609340.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9d6247a9-913e-43c4-b068-ca89ff003676.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"810d7f8f-82d7-4f79-8793-111c46db9c2d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bachelor Party & Gigolo","Overview":"When adult-game company Mystique went out of business, PlayAround bought the rights to their games. Along with the original Mystique titles, PlayAround also released a number of their own adult-themed games. These games were released in pairs on special \"double-end\" cartridges.\n\nThe two games contained in this release are \"Bachelor Party\" and \"Gigolo\".\n\nBachelor Party is a re-release of the original game created by Mystique. The game features a man bouncing pong-style back and forth, eliminating advancing rows of women. The gameplay is similar to titles like Breakout, except the action plays out horizontally instead of vertically.\n\nGigolo is a re-working of Cathouse Blues, another original game created by PlayAround (only with gender roles reversed). Instead of a man, it features a woman who must search the houses around town for a \"good time\". While that sounds easy enough, the player also has to deal with police, muggers, and houses that are wired with alarms. This is odd, because a gigolo is a male prostitute, while that title is attached to the version with the female hooker, not the man-whore.","Publisher":"PlayAround","ReleaseDate":"1982-12-30T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"158236":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Self-Published","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"5c66eaa7-e6a0-465c-886a-1c781eab8689.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"424b55ba-7a26-4a17-a2a0-34c97447eb8b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Mondo Pong","Overview":"Mondo Pong was Piero Cavina's first programming effort on the Atari 2600 and is an evil variation on the game that started it all, Pong.

Sometimes the ball will double back at you after you hit it, other times it might just spin around in circles for a bit, keeping you on your toes as you wait for it to shoot off in some direction (hopefully not at you!) \n\nThere are several game variations that allow you to select one or two players and a score limit of 15 or 45. There is also a normal vs. hard option, but that is not implemented in this version of Mondo Pong. \n\nThis is an Alpha Version of Mondo Pong as it was never completed! Therefore, the game doesn't have the polish you might expect from a finished game and there may be a few bugs.

I've always thought that the extra effort that goes into a title born of passion for a particular genre or console really shows when playing such a game. Thrust is regarded as one of the best homebrew games for the Atari 2600. Loosely based on Gravitar, Thrust offeres amazing control, great game play and insane difficulty.\n\nThe cover above is actually from Thrust+ (i believe) released in 2002 with support for a wide variety of controllers. The difficulty of Thrust doesn't impede on the fun of the game. It's control is so good, it's difficulty is an attribute as one masters the best way to handle situations as gravity pulls you downward.\n\nThrust Story Arc:\n\nThe Intergalactic Empire has captured several battle-grade starships in reparation for an attack by the resistance. Their weakness is an inability to power these starships, called Klystron Pods. As a member of the resistance, your job is to steal the Klystron Pods from the Empire's storage planets. The planets are heavily armed and well defended by Limpet guns. These guns can be taken out by firing on their reactors. This will temporarily disable the guns, but too many shots will cause a critical state in the reactor - blowing up the planet.\n\nIf the planet explodes before you retrieve the pod it will be destroyed in the explosion rendering your mission a failure. If you already have the pod and can escape prior to the reactor reaches a critical phase, you are generously rewarded with bonus points."},"163549":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Colin Hughes","Images":[{"FileName":"4a2489f2-a5fd-40c2-b3ab-cb75a3544395.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fc56c1ff-baa7-48c7-a420-18a85a9924e4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"99410f72-3040-4cd5-b20d-f8cc486db4eb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"722da820-2a46-42e2-92b2-203aeeea697a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a609402f-c976-4f19-b532-5ea54d8ed334.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a9b4d88f-7d67-4f36-8fd9-f962ac69f2f8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"73427a1c-4ab2-437e-b7a3-715bd08985e4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tetris 26","Publisher":"Self-Published"},"163550":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"0a6d6294-b1cd-4ac7-8e71-4e2bc2d59016.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7bcc20ec-e3fe-41c3-abcc-ec5115b45248.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"10197b3f-574c-4bf9-8f02-06f86a16abb7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b918e518-a958-4627-9649-a56fde6d79fd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5da00313-80ef-4dd2-87c8-a793baf01b81.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6b41db41-d636-4fab-9188-98ddf79d3879.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Seaweed Assault","Overview":"Your name is Captain Nalad Modnar and you are part of an advanced underwater civilization. It's your duty to patrol your section of the ocean in a semi-organic submarine called the Manatee. Highly aggressive seaweed surrounds you and it keeps trying to replicate faster than you can shoot. Use your torpedoes to blast any bits of seaweed that appear before they clog up your sector and spread to others, making it nearly impossible for anyone to travel. Don't let the seaweed strangle your civilization to extinction.\n\nSeaweed Assault is an engaging and original homebrew title for the Atari 2600 by Duane Alan Hahn. You must deftly pilot your Manatee, avoiding seaweed that can damage your vessel, as well as Wrothopods, a protected species of cephalopods that travel deep to feed on parasites that attach to mature seaweed. Your goal is to keep the sea lanes free of seaweed, and to that end you must blast the seaweed with your torpedos. However, watch out for mature seaweed tentacles that reach up from the depths to try and grab your Manatee!\n\nSome relief is offered in the form of Homing Health Canisters, which appear after you've shot 100 bits of seaweed. The more quickly you grab a canister, the more health units will be replenished for your Manatee. Be wary of corroded Homing Health Canisters, which you may uncover when clearing bits of seaweed! If you don't salvage these in time, their damaged circuits will home in on the Manatee and try to ram it, causing damage that will take one health unit to repair."},"163588":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Simone Serra","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8ae3a9b1-5026-42d0-b5c2-82040fe6b850.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e0d29a09-36fe-4791-9e07-cd912c7a6c0c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45b28091-e697-4fe7-bd20-48496246068d.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c1b2759b-726c-4933-b088-0a2cd0b32fdd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0b370f20-bbcf-4f6b-9a3b-a478cfed40ea.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"12654fb1-7692-4d95-917b-abec2affaabd.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sync","Overview":"Sync is a collection of rhythm and puzzle games.\n\nMantra:\nThe screen will show various symbols.

Are there really suitcases full of money at the top of those unfinished buildings downtown? The ones still under construction? And those suitcases, they're just there for the taking? You would never have believed it except that the guy who told you about it, a regular union guy like you, just bought a brand new Corvette. You know that two weeks ago he didn't have that kind of money, so you guess he's telling the truth. When you asked him how come he didn't get the rest of the suitcases, he got an odd look on his face and wouldn't say another word. Strange...\n\nYour objective in Squish 'Em is to climb those 48-floor buildings to grab the cash-filled suitcase at the top of each one. As if scaling the heights of the buildings was not dangerous enough, you have to be alert for falling bricks from above and watch for creepy critters who've made these buildings their home! Once you reach the top of each building, you can grab the suitcase and continue to the next building.\n\nAlong the way you'll encounter a wide range of critters that you must avoid or jump over. You can even squish the creatures with your feet, but you can only squish each creature once before they turn white with rage and pop back up, looking for revenge! Once a creature has turned white you cannot squish it again! In addition to the creatures, each building has a bonus item that you can collect to receive an extra man.\n\nSquish 'Em was written by veteran Atari 2600 homebrew author Bob Montgomery, who has several previous 2600 homebrew games under his belt, including Go Fish!, Reindeer Rescue, and Elevators Amiss. Squish 'Em is a near flawless port of the old Atari 8-bit computer name of the same name--fans of the original game will be pleased to see this impressive and addictive incarnation of the game on the Atari 2600!","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"163644":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fabrizio Zavagli","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4768d679-4e71-4ee0-9ee8-65405fbfb2f2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"badda0e1-9203-4d6a-8ef3-a9c3ba393e23.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"51fa0938-63c7-4b97-90a0-77999e5904bf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"657f5f28-ea57-408b-9a48-92a14edd650b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"19973625-af78-4cc6-b45c-7393af003d6a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"19fa0e23-da3e-4d28-8eed-ad07ce327222.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Space Treat Deluxe","Overview":"In Space Treat Deluxe, you control a ship that must reach the top of the screen, collect the tasty treat located there, and get it back to its base at the bottom.

To complicate things further, any square directly to the left, right, above, or below the square is also \"flipped.\"","Publisher":"RetroWare","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":1996},"164711":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Piero Cavina","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0c805a0a-5e8a-4507-8b2a-e817964c1dd6.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"76723373-3166-49f3-aeef-ac3df03da10f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ae01e207-3ecf-47a8-8584-50a40c5967d3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c75850f2-e933-4399-a04c-3a1adb46914e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae0bf83e-1af6-49da-9603-8cb1e4066285.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c2f00162-ca99-4ce1-bc60-40855b3f2b82.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"99e65254-d3b9-47ed-8039-9f4ff1f29c67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2e77d548-616e-4784-951f-d92eab0a0ae9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Oystron","Overview":"Oystron is an action game developed for the Atari 2600 by Piero Cavina and released in 1997. It is one of the earliest hobbyist-written games for the console. The game, Cavina's first, was initially made available as a freeware 4 KB binary file designed for use on the Starpath Supercharger and with Atari 2600 emulators. It was later released in cartridge form by XYPE, a group of Atari 2600 homebrew developers.\n\nOystron is an action game in which the player controls a ship using the joystick controller, firing at enemies and collecting pearls dropped by \"space oysters\". The player's ship initially appears on the left side of the screen, and enemies attack from the right. Shooting the space oysters reveals a pearl; the player then collides with the pearl and brings it to the \"pearl zone\" on the left side of the screen. Other enemies appear that attempt to steal the pearls. Collecting eight pearls earns the player a bomb.\n\nAt the end of each level, a boss named \"Oystron\" appears; the player can defeat the Oystron by placing a bomb in its path, or waiting until it changes into a space oyster. Following the appearance of the Oystron is a warp phase, in which the player travels at high speed and must avoid colliding with enemies. The player is given four ships at the beginning of a game, and earns an additional ship every 4000 points.\n\nIn 2003, Oystron was one of several Atari 2600 homebrew titles selected by Activision for inclusion in the Game Boy Advance version of their Activision Anthology. In 2005, it was named one of the five \"Best 2600 Homebrew Games\" in the book Gaming Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools by Simon Carless, who praised the game's fast pace, sprites and color scheme.","Publisher":"XYPE","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":1997,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1o9xSZK29Eo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oystron"},"164713":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Chris Crawford","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a942e2f6-be3f-4d19-ad76-c9568876161c.png","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"80f73074-c7d8-4094-93d7-08cf7c6cf133.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"2d228c08-3e22-4ef6-b756-cec1a4bea527.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"186f70f7-24c0-4923-aec0-fff94177bf8c.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"361ced83-6e7a-43a1-a37c-272f2b53c117.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c4c58f65-9058-40d2-a73b-e0c7148b5a5b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a0c463f-9f9f-4b10-bde8-80b75f76932e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f4bdef9c-a042-4cfa-961b-57dfbdf0d773.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wizard","Overview":"Wizard is a video game created in 1980 for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed the Atari 2600) by Chris Crawford while working for Atari, Inc. The game was not advertised or released by Atari. Wizard uses a 2K ROM, the last Atari 2600 game developed by Atari with less than 4K. Wizard was eventually released as part of the Atari Flashback 2 package in 2005.\n\nThe player is a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles imps in a maze. It's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. There is no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire is automatically sent in the direction of the enemy. The enemy remains invisible when it is behind a wall. It also has heart beat audio, which becomes louder as the player gets closer to the enemy.\n\nThe production of Wizard is detailed extensively in the book Chris Crawford on Game Design. Crawford wanted to write software for the new Atari home computers, but Atari management required developers for the system to create an Atari VCS game first.\n\nWizard was never released for the Atari VCS. It was first released on the Atari Flashback 2, 25 years after it was written. Its developer, Chris Crawford, was not even told about Wizard's eventual release on the Flashback 2, and learned about it in an email from a fan. Crawford's original prototype did not contain a two-player mode, but the game released with the Atari Flashback 2 does.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1980,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizard_(2005_video_game)"},"164878":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"D.K.

For many years we did not know the name of this game since the label that once existed had long since fallen off. However in 2017 another copy of this game appeared on Ebay UK complete with a label. We now know that the game is called Hard Head.\n\nHard Head plays somewhat like Atari's Save Mary.  However this time instead of building a tower by dropping bricks from the top of the screen, you must bump blocks from the bottom of the screen.  Before you start screaming about Activision copying Atari's idea, keep in mind that this game was programmed about seven years before Save Mary.  I'm sure the similarity of the concepts is just a coincidence.\n\nIn Hard Head you control a little Space Invader guy who must use the blocks at the bottom of the screen to build a tower and escape.  As the blocks come rolling down the conveyor belt, you must jump up and bump them so they land somewhere on the screen (the blocks don't count if they go off the edge of the screen).  The movement scheme in this prototype is a bit unusual as the longer you hold the joystick in a direction, the faster your little guy will run.  Although this is very realistic, it is a bit odd for a 2600 game and may take some time to get used to.  Once you have constructed a nice little tower, you must carefully jump on the conveyor belt and them climb the tower.  Be extra careful on the conveyor belt, as touching the blocks will cause your little guy to be flattened.  \n\nStarting on the second level, you'll undoubtedly notice that some blocks will flash yellow or blue.  These colored blocks are actually part of an elaborate timing\/bonus system.  The yellow block (which I call the Bump block) moves up the tower at the rate of once block a second, while the blue block (which I call the Bonus block) moves up the tower one block every time the yellow block reaches the top of the screen.  If your character happen to be on the tower when the yellow block touches him, you will be knocked down one level (slowing your decent up the tower).  However if your character touches the blue 'Bonus' block, you will gain bonus points as long as he remains on the block.  However greed can be a dangerous thing as the tower will collapse after a certain amount of time (determined by the difficulty level).  When the warning alarm sounds, you have exactly 10 seconds to hightail it up the tower or you'll be crushed under the debris.\n\nStarting on the third level, strange aliens creatures will begin to fly around the screen.  You can destroy them by hitting them with a flying block.  Smashing aliens is worth 180 points, while simply bumping a block will net you 5 points.  If you let the octopus alien reach the bottom of the screen he'll start breeding and clog the area.  However since you can simply knock the extra aliens out of the way so he's not a really big problem.  If you're really tricky you can use the blocks to fence in the alien and keep him form reaching the bottom, but this is more trouble than it's worth.  Starting on the fourth level a squat looking alien with two legs will rapidly move down the screen and try to catch your guy at the bottom of the screen.  When this happens you'll need to jump on the conveyer belt temporarily to escape until he disappears.  Unfortunately this alien is immune to the blocks so all you can do is avoid him.  If you manage to score 100,000 points the score counter will reset to zero and you will be rewarded with an extra life.\n\nUnlike most Activision games, Hard Head has no game variations. However since this is still a WIP, game variations may have been planned later on. The left difficulty switch controls the game difficulty (A=Easy, B=Hard), while the right switch appears to control how your character climbs the blocks. When the right difficulty switch is in the 'B' position you cannot touch the center of the tower, as doing so will result in a block smashing your character. Instead you must build the tower in a staircase-like fashion and climb up the edges of the blocks. Naturally this is much more difficult to set up than a simple tower of blocks, so this variation is recommended for experts only. When the right switch is in the 'A' position, your character can climb up the center of the blocks making things much easier. Although this prototype appears to be nearly complete, there are still a few bugs in the game. Glitches include such things as your character getting stuck in the walls, and the screen becoming unstable when being bumped by the yellow block or when avoiding the leg alien.\n\nThe graphics and sounds for this title are top notch; it's obvious that a lot of work went into this game. Everything from the smooth animation of your character to the cute \"Can-Can\" sequence at the start of the game screams quality. So why was this game never released? Unfortunately no one but the programmer knows the answer to this, but one possibility is that they may have left Activision before the game was completed. However since the real name of this game has now been discovered, we may yet be able to find the programmer and discover the history behind this interesting game.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mitch and bjk7382 for figuring out how to play the game in the 'A' position.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"WikipediaURL":"http:\/\/www.atariprotos.com\/2600\/software\/unknown2\/unknown2.htm"},"166895":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"a5a00286-ea51-4894-a1d9-9f2af6f3b121.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Morse Code Tutor","Overview":"It’s well known that Atari wasn’t afraid to take risks when it came to developing new games.  Some ideas were just too far out there to be marketable (such as Mindlink and Mind Maze), while others were just to niche to sell well enough (such as Mark of the Mole).  Morse Code Tutor falls squarely into the latter category.  Although I’m sure that there were indeed Morse Code enthusiasts who owned Atari 2600’s, they probably didn’t make up a large enough group to bother with.  \n\nLittle is known about the origins of this prototype or if Morse Code Tutor is even its real name.  Found in a box of miscellaneous items from a former programmer, Morse Code Tutor is just what it sounds like: a program for helping the user learn to send and receive messages in Morse Code.  It’s hard to believe that there would have been any market for something like this, but a similar program was released for the Videopac (Odyssey^2) system in Europe so there is some precedence. \n\nFrom the main screen you can select the Word Speed (5-72), Character Speed (5-72), and Pitch.  Word Speed affects how fast the words you need to send appear, while Character Speed affects how fast the individual characters in the words appear.  Pitch allows you to change the tone of the ‘beep’ that occurs each time you tap out a character.   Pressing the button on the screen will produce a tone so you can test out your pitch level. \n\nAfter you’ve selected your options the only way to move on with the game is to move the left difficulty switch to the B position.  This will produce a screen with some letters on it for you to try and signal.  Moving the switch back to A will bring you back to the options screen.  Pressing the reset button when on the Letters Screen will produce different combinations of letters, numbers, and eventually punctuation.  The order is: 5 screens of letters (always in the same order), the entire alphabet, 3 screens of numbers (1-5, 6-0, then all the numbers), the entire alphabet with all the numbers, 3 screens of punctuation characters, then a screen with all the letters, numbers, and punctuation.  This final screen is a bit different as it has a flashing cursor thst you can move and make letters disappear and reappear by pressing the button, but the use of this is unknown.  After this screen pressing reset once more will bring up the word SEND, after that it will repeat back to the screens of letters. \n\nThe prototype itself doesn’t seem to be complete, so there may be more functionality hidden in the code.  Due to the small rom size (only 2K) and bare bones nature of the program, this would have been a very early release (1980 or earlier). It’s unknown if Atari was really planning on releasing Morse Code Tutor or if this was simply a toy created by a programmer playing around in his spare time.    Either way Morse Code Tutor is one of the more unique programs in the 2600 library.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1979},"166896":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Rocky and Bullwinkle"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"43a7036b-16fb-48cb-a062-5e88b5c39992.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rocky & Bullwinkle","Overview":"According to the catalog entry: \"Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the evil Boris and Natasha from robbing a train full of priceless valuables. While Boris uses \"Upsidasium\" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping.\"  Now I know the show didn't exactly make sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when they came up with this plot? \n\nTwisted plot aside, Rocky & Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they float up to Natasha.  R&B sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects.  Treasures can be snagged by flying Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent muscles he can only hold two valuables at once.  While you can give any treasure to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on the screen, these are the two that actually count.  If you give these two treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to 75, giving you more time to look for the next combination.  However there's another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do.  When this timer runs out, the game ends.  This timer can be extended by selecting different game variations.  \n\nWhile you're zipping around the screen Natasha will occasionally drop something out of her plane which looks like a row of brown dots (bullets?) which will cause you to fly out of control for a few seconds if they hit out.  Other than Natasha there's really nothing in this game that can harm you, but since this was a kiddie game it wasn't exactly supposed to be violent.  Bullwinkle will occasionally drop a brown box of some sort which allows Rocky to carry six treasures instead of 2.  The left difficulty switch affects how many treasures you need to give to Bullwinkle (one or two), while the select button changes Rocky's control scheme.  Normally Rocky simply moves left, right, up, and down with the joystick as you would expect, but by pressing the select button you can put him in loop mode (indicated by the arrows at the bottom of the screen).  While Rocky is in loop mode pressing up or right will cause him to do a right loop (the long you hold it down the further he goes into the loop), and pressing left or down will cause Rocky to do a left loop.  While this control scheme may sound difficult, it becomes second nature after a few minutes.  \n\nAs if the game wasn't strange enough, you can change the shapes into numbers and mathematical symbols by putting the TV Type switch to B&W.  This makes the game a bit more challenging because now the player must add or subtract the numbers they catch to equal the number Bullwinkle is displaying (ack! edutainment!).  In this mode the left difficulty switch controls the difficulty of the numbers (1 or 2 digits).  As with the treasure variation, you can give other numbers to Bullwinkle for points, but they don't count towards the solution.  This variation also lacks the 'storage box' that is present in the treasure variation.  \n\nThe amazing thing about this prototype isn't the gameplay, it's the graphics.  It's simply amazing how many items are moving on the screen at one time with absolutely no flicker.  The train circles the bottom of the screen puffing smoke, Bullwinkle circles around the sky in his plane, Natasha moves back and forth in the helicopter (shooting at Rocky), and tons of valuables constantly move up the screen.   All of this action actually makes it the screen a bit busy, which has to be a first for any 2600 game.  \n\nThe 2600 version of Rocky & Bullwinkle was actually designed before the Intellivision version, instead of the other way around as was usually the case.  Even though Rocky & Bullwinkle was complete and passed quality assurance, it was canceled for unknown reasons.  The Intellivision version was still on schedule to be released, but Mattel closed their doors before it could be completed.  The rom file for this game exists, but has never been publicly distributed due to copyright reasons.","Publisher":"Mattel","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983},"166898":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ben Burch","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"670db7c9-c0fb-40f0-9ed9-147f60b4fa5a.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b00ce747-b689-458b-b427-ba7f5480df0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rush Hour","Overview":"Ever been stuck in a traffic jam?  Haven't you always wished you could just floor it and zip in and out of traffic, blowing up all the cars that were in your way?  While you may not be able to do it in real life (not without a lengthy jail sentence anyway), here's one game that will let you live out your fantasy on the 2600.  Rush Hour is one of the long lost Commavid games that everyone assumed existed somewhere.  Not only was Rush Hour advertised in catalogs, but prototype boxes had already been produced hinting that the game was almost finished. Sadly Rush Hour, along with Underworld and Mission Omega, never made it to store shelves before Commavid folded.  \n\nRush Hour is a driving\/action game similar to Spy Hunter, but turned on its side.  Your goal is to zip in and out of traffic on a five lane highway, and destroy the five car carriers that are causing the traffic jam.  Your car comes equipped with two laser headlights (they come standard with the deluxe package), which you can use to shoot any cars that get in your way.  However once a car is destroyed it will turn into a deadly pile of debris which cannot be destroyed.  You can avoid the debris by changing lanes, but since this is rush hour finding an open space can be difficult.  Alternatively you can also burn cars to a crisp with your red-hot exhaust (I'm sure the environmentalists just love your car), this is useful for those pesky cars that like to sneak up behind you.  Also on the road you'll also see what appear to be oil slicks, but in this prototype the code to handle them is not present.  \n\nAs you zip in and out of traffic you'll undoubtedly get hit at least once.  Thankfully your car is alot tougher than it looks and won't be instantly destroyed.  However depending on the severity of the crash, your car will take some damage which will affect how it functions.  The damage will be repaired over time, but you can also repair this damage by stopping on the top of the bottom of the road.  However in the time it takes to repair your car, you may risk letting the carriers get away (as shown on the radar at the bottom of the screen).  Interestingly there's a bug in the code that causes your car to get repaired past the normal limit (this was due to the programmer confusing hexadecimal with decimal notation).  \n\nOnce you've reached the carriers you must carefully watch and shoot each one as it unloads its car.  Before a carrier unloads a car it will turn orange and flash briefly, it's during this time you must shoot.  As you're shooting the carriers be careful to avoid the cars that are unloaded as crashing into one will almost certainly result in your untimely demise.  Also take note that you only have one life in Rush Hour, lose it and it's game over. \n\nAlthough Rush Hour is playable, the prototype still has a bunch of bugs that needed to fixed before it was released.  The most serious of these bugs is in the display routine, which will cause the screen to jump unexpectedly from time to time (especially when you reach the carriers).  Other bugs include slight graphic and sound glitches, nonfunctional oil slicks, and inaccuracies in the radar.  It seems the game was in the process of being debugged when the programmer was involved in a serious car accident (how's that for irony?).  Due to this accident, Rush Hour was delayed and never completely finished. \n\nCommavid was always known for their interesting games, and Rush Hour is no exception.  Rush Hour was one of the first games Commavid not programmed in-house; instead it was contracted out to an independent programmer.  It appears that Commavid was finally starting to make some headway towards becoming a larger player on the 2600 scene; unfortunately the market crash put an end to those dreams.","Publisher":"CommaVid","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983},"166899":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"North American Phillips","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"57c9bffc-9907-45d9-843e-4b622b56acc8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e3c2d956-bcd2-44ad-9a18-12317b1a6f3a.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"09e01dc6-8c88-4bfe-8fd7-34d6115408fe.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b3ef0d2c-ee4b-4d71-8b39-66bf817ac138.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fad33645-621a-40ed-86a8-d1cf08ff793f.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"644438e0-aaac-473f-a618-f537db4a28a9.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7605426c-0766-46a0-81bc-0c3f2669ab52.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Power Lords","Overview":"Description: 'Adam, Leader of the Lords, and Shaya, Queen of Power, are extra-terrestrial warriors who battle deadly aliens on the mystical Volcan Rock.

North American Phillips (NAP) must have thought that it was going to be a huge hit, because games were developed for the Atari 2600, Colecovision and Odyssey 2. Of these games only the Odyssey 2 version was released and is considered to be the rarest US released game for the system. All three versions play similarly, but the Atari 2600 and Colecovision versions have an additional stage which makes the game slightly more interesting. Like the other versions, the 2600 version of Power Lords is not all that fun to play and the overall difficulty of the game is also rather high.

Never heard of it.\", then you're not alone.  Racer was an original game developed by Roklan for Atari (their first actually), and not based on any existing arcade game.  Now if you're saying to yourself \"Roklan?  Never heard of them.\", then you just need to play some more Atari 8-bit games.\n\nRoklan was a major 3rd party developer of games back in the 80's, making games for the Atari 2600, 5200\/8-bit, C-64, Vic-20, CoCo, and even the TI-99\/4a.  However Roklan generally did not publish games under their own name, so most never knew they existed.  However for some strange reason, they did publish their 8-bit titles under the Roklan name, which is where most people will recognize the name from (that and from their famous fading labels).\n\nGetting back to the 2600, Roklan developed at least four games for the Atari 2600 but two were never published.  You've probably played Crazy Climber and Gorf, and maybe you've played the unreleased RealSports Basketball, but there was a fourth title that people didn't know existed until now.\n\nRacer was Roklan's first title for the Atari 2600, and as such, is a rather simple game.  The player controls an strangely phallic shaped car which they must maneuver around the screen and avoid crashing into the walls.  The screen scrolls downward, so you are constantly moving forward.  As such there is no gas button, nor is there a brake button.  All you can do as hang on and dodge those walls!\n\nAt the start of the game, the walls move rather slowly.  In fact it is almost impossible to crash into a wall unless you're trying to do it on purpose.  However about every 30 seconds the game will speed up, and the walls will come faster and faster until they become unavoidable to anyone who isn't a Jedi.  This usually happens around the fifth speed up.\n\nEach player starts with three lives, with extra lives being awarded every 30 points.  There are ten different game variations, each one changing the number of players and the speed at which the game starts.  The last two variations are a sort of 'Children's Mode' where the game starts at the slowest speed and never speeds up.\n\nAlthough the one player version of Racer is rather ho-hum, the game really shines in the two player modes.  Unlike most Atari 2600 games, Racer offers two player simultaneous play.  In the two player variations you and a friend square off against one another in an attempt to get the highest score.  Each player can stay on their side of the screen and try to beat the other player purely based on skill, but why would you want to do that?  The best part of Racer is that you can bang and crash into the other player, forcing them into the oncoming walls.  Of course the other player can do the exact same thing back to you, so be careful.  Careful strategy is needed when deciding what the right time is to ram you car into the other player.\n\nWhile Racer is an alright game, it lacks long term playability.  The one player game is too simple and ends too quickly, and the two player game isn't much more interesting.  It was probably for this reason that Atari declined to pick up Racer, and Roklan didn't try and put it out themselves.  Racer has potential, but it needs more variation to make it interesting (different wall layouts, an enemy car , power ups, etc.).  Still, Racer is a rare and interesting glimpse into the secret lives of third party developers.","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1982},"167253":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"038a7e04-1fc6-449a-a65b-1a5b9d6dd349.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a56a127-ab34-46c9-a621-c357a8c512ca.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b916c616-b245-4b4e-a0f8-a24b7792c39a.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a9b30b01-cb1f-4ec5-b6e7-14d57ec51957.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"13fd42d1-0b4d-434f-9945-536b917ff6bb.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac2d7eaa-8954-47ad-b2bb-0861e437e534.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Good Luck Charlie Brown","Overview":"Good Luck Charlie Brown should have been the last of the Children's Work Shop releases, but never saw the light of day.  Although the game was found a long time ago, the rom had not been dumped until quite recently so the game is still a bit of a mystery.   The only known version is very incomplete with little gameplay implemented, but rumors persist of a far more complete version in existence.  \n\nThe game only consists of one screen in which you control Charlie Brown as he flies his kite around the screen.  At the bottom of the screen there's a wind gauge which shows the speed and direction of the wind.  There's also a timer a the bottom of the screen which slowly counts up which may be part of the scoring system (based on total time instead of score).  You goal is to fly your kite as long as possible while avoiding birds, balloons, rockets, and of course the deadly Kite Eating Tree.  According to the catalog description, if Charlie Brown lost his kite he would have to earn another chance by raking leaves (what fun!).  Obviously this part of the game was not implemented yet.\n\nPushing the joystick left and right moves Charlie Brown around the screen.  Pushing up and down will let out or pull in the kite string, thus making the kite move up and down.  If the kite hits an obstacle the game will freeze for a moment and Charlie Brown will have to start again, but if the kite hits the Kite Eating Tree, Charlie Brown will actually flip over and all the balloons will turn black due to the fact that they share a color pallet with Charlie Brown and gets glitched up when he flips over.  Occasionally what appears to be lightning will flash in the background, but doesn't seem to have any adverse effects other than scaring the player (I actually jumped the first time this happened).  The lightning only appears if you move your kite into the clouds and it increases if you move into the higher layer of clouds. \n\nInterestingly it appears that by using the second joystick the player has some limited control the rom of balloons. This could be the start of an unfinished two player variation of the game (code hints at four possible variations), but it is very preliminary in this prototype.  There are no sounds or music in this version of the game, but this isn't surprising since sounds and music were usually one of the last things to finished.  The graphics appear to be top notch, but are slightly glitchy.  For example, the clouds appear to randomly disappear and reappear at various times during the game.  The row of birds also appears to suffer from this, but not to the same degree as the clouds.  This is obviously a sign that the game was still early in development.. \n\nAccording to the catalogs Good Luck Charlie Brown was supposed to be to released Summer of 83, and since this prototype is dated April of 84 we can assume development was taking longer than expected.  By 1984 Atari had canceled the Children's series so Good Luck Charlie Brown would have been canceled with it.  It's a shame though, because what was finished looks rather interesting.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yn8jHZmtVlU"},"167634":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Robert Anthony Tokar","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"f80f78f3-fb58-43af-af81-eec81935eb5a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"d94bdcda-ba7c-4373-b6a4-96874c2afd03.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"229d6731-1e18-438f-aefc-ed0fe18ebe39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Birthday Mania","Overview":"This extremely rare game was sold in the U.S. state New Jersey by Personal Games Company.

In fact, there were actually three games planned for the 'Terra I Trilogy', although only the first two were released. The first game, called Rescue Terra I, had you traveling through an onslaught of aliens and asteroids to reach the planet of Terra I. The second game, called Innerspace, has you travel through planetary tunnels to destroy the computer system and return control to the Terra I colonists. The third and final game of the Trilogy, called Solar Defense, had you defending solar reactors around the earth while the Terra I colonists supplied them with Zenbar crystals. Having all three games linked together with a storyline (as thin as it was) was a novel idea at the time, but sadly it was not to be. While VentureVision was able to release their first game, they went under before the second or third could be released. Imagic picked up Innerspace and released it as Laser Gates, but Solar Defense remained unreleased.\n\nYou have reached Terra I and must now fight your way to a centralized computer system located at the planet's core. The objective of the game is to destroy the computer system and return control of the planet to the colonists. Your task will involve a great deal of skill and an element of luck.","Publisher":"Venture Vision","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983},"172880":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Devin Cook","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"7a6769f6-ef61-460d-8302-203bb4a27bd3.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"caa757d3-bdf4-4f14-bf2e-3c1767e74da6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"K.O.

The one player game starts with a random board and your cursor located in the middle. Above the board is a countdown timer and the player's score is shown below the board. Pressing the fire button of your joystick shows the pattern which you have to find inside the board. Releasing the fire button brings you back to the board where you have to search for the pattern. Pressing the fire button at the right position awards you with the remaining time as points and the next level. Pressing the button at a wrong position shows the small pattern again. The game ends when the time counter runs to 00. To make things a bit more difficult, the time counter runs faster when the small pattern is displayed.\n\nThe Two Players Game\nIf you chose the two players game in the intro, the game starts with two different cursors inside the board and individual scores for each player. The objective is the same as in the one player game: look at the pattern and search for it inside the game board. Both players can watch the small pattern individually, but remember that the time runs faster when the small pattern is shown. Releasing the fire button brings you back to the board where you have to search for the pattern. Pressing the fire button at the right position awards the winning player with one point and the game continues with the next level. Pressing the button on a wrong position shows the small pattern again. \nThe game ends when either the time counter runs to 00 or one of the players manages to reach 9 points. To make things a bit more difficult, the time counter runs faster when the small pattern is displayed. It runs even faster if both players press the fire button at the same time.\n\nThe Game Time Modes\nYou can choose one of the two game modes with the left difficulty switch. The \"Easy\" setting gives you a fixed time limit per level, starting at 90 and decreasing by 5 per level until a minimum of 20 seconds is reached. All following levels give you 20 seconds time limit. \n\nThe \"Hard\" setting gives you 90 seconds at the beginning of the first level. You start the next level with the remaining time of the previous one. This means that the time is running from 90 to 0 and you can solve as many levels as possible within this time. Solving each level gives you a bonus time of 5 seconds.","Publisher":"Atari Age","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"172886":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bob Montgomery","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"4bec0800-0220-45db-b525-8da256e47959.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a9fb98a5-6d9e-4038-b3e6-51d000522eb9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Reindeer Rescue","Overview":"Reindeer Rescue is an original homebrew game written by Bob Montgomery, author of the captivating homebrew game Go Fish!

Using your precision Atari Joystick, you will help him guide the CX-40 Voidstar's Photon Laser Device to take apart the Xotec Pulsar fields particle by particle.\n\nIt won't be easy. The Pulsar fields get harder the farther in you go. Your Z2PA Advanced Calculation Computer will show you a view of the Pulsar field at the atomic level. Each block is a single particle in the overall field. Particles come in several colors, and these tend to be grouped into larger groups of the same color, due to the subatomic structure of the Xotec fields. The Scientific types are calling them 'Microconglomerate Quantum Phase Packets', but our R&D boys just call them 'chunks'.\n\nEach chunk of the Pulsar Field can be burned away with a nanosecond pulse of the Voidstar's Photon Laser. One pulse destroys all connecting particles of the same color. As you burn away chunks of the field, the other particles will rearrange themselves. Particles of similar color will form larger chunks, and that is the key to success. Skillful use of the Photon Laser will allow you to combine, and then eliminate all of the particles in the current Pulsar Field, and then it's further down into the Xotec defenses as you systematically burrow through the Pulsar Fields. Reach the homeworld, and the war is over.\n\nThe further in you go, the tougher things get. The inner defenses of the Xotec homeworld are very tricky. Scans show that the particle distribution becomes very difficult, and the chunks get continually smaller, forcing you to use all of your abilities to combine them in to big enough chunks. No one ever said this would be a cake walk.","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"174412":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atarius Maximus","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"32b3766b-0671-4eb6-9a7a-34d7cde9f743.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Diamond Drop","Overview":"Diamond Drop is a small 4k game that is loosely based on the iOS game 'Duet'. \nYou have two Diamonds at the bottom of the screen that will rotate in a circle in either direction along a diamond shaped path.

Enraged, the Evil Magician has reclaimed the chalice and vowed to avenge the loss of his beloved dragons. Joining the pursuit is his vile apprentice, and it’s also rumored that he has created an even more hideous creature to guard the chalice this time around.\n\nAs in your last Adventure, the object of the game is to recapture the Enchanted Chalice and return it to the Gold Castle walls. Once again, this will not be an easy quest. The Evil Magician (red wizard) and his apprentice (grey wizard) can cast spells that weaken and slow you. Their touch is deadly, but all hope is not lost. They are vulnerable to attack by the Fire Staff— swords will not help you in this Adventure. The Evil Magician will succumb to two hits from the staff and his apprentice needs only one well-placed fireball. They may not stay deceased for long however— the wizards can use their resurrection spells to revive each other.\n\nThere are four castles in your Kingdom: the Gold Castle, the White Castle, the Red Castle, and the Grey Castle. Your home castle, the Gold Castle, is already open, but the other castles need to be opened with the proper Key. Inside the castles are multiple rooms, some of which are dark and can only be explored by torchlight. The castles are separated by the familiar labyrinths, but the Evil Magician has made sure that your old pathways will just lead to dead-ends.\n\nScattered throughout the kingdom are certain items to help you in your search for the Enchanted Chalice. To pick up an item, simply touch it, but remember that you can only carry one item at a time. To open any castle, touch the castle gate while in possession of the proper key. The white castle key will open up the White Castle, the red dragon key will open up the Red Castle, and the grey skull key will open up the Grey Castle.\n\nAlong your journeys you will find various items to assist in your quest (such as various keys, the Fire Staff and Enchanted Chalice), as well as enemies who will attempt to thwart your quest (the Bat, Apprentice, Evil Magician and Chalice Guardian).

This game actually started out life as Trail of the Pink Panther by U.S. Games (based on the then current movie), but when U.S. Games went out of business they sold the rights to North American Phillips (NAP) who decided to release their own version of the game through their Probe 2000 division. It is unknown if any work was already done on the U.S. Games version or if any of those ideas were used in the Probe 2000 version of the game. Although Pursuit of the Pink Panther was heavily marketed at the June 1983 CES, it was never released, most probably because the special RAM\/ROM chip that NAP used to squeeze all the graphics and gameplay elements into the game couldn't be reliably manufactured. When the first batch of chips came back defective from the manufacturer NAP decided to cancel the game rather than try and find a new source for the chips. The crumbling game market at the time was also a big factor in choosing not to go forward.\n\nDescription: 'Players control the Pink Panther as he sneakily makes his way through several screens, attempting to outwit the Inspector.

(Blue level will finish you off.) With regard to the collectible objects, picking up 4 fruits in sequence will open up the power-ups. (I haven't drawn the 4th fruit yet, so for now it shows as a bronze question mark). The skateboard increases speed (on the x-axis) for a short time - good for negotiating levels with long platforms\/small gaps. The down arrow increases gravity slightly - you need to collect several of them to really feel the effect. The red stop sign temporarily slows the scrolling, the silver question mark doesn't do anything yet. Miss a fruit or power-up and you have to start back at fruit 1. I'll almost certainly change the way this works, and the stop sign doesn't really do much for the gameplay so I'll probably ditch that.\n\n \n\nAll feedback welcome.","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2006},"181128":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Quadrunner","Images":[{"FileName":"f1431d55-698b-4849-b4fd-41c004220d77.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"68fc58b5-546a-486c-8cc2-73034b2d9f5d.PNG","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1af4fd40-ecb6-4a40-ab3b-e6f3e8e41ca9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Miss It!","Overview":"Miss It is a one player game where the object is to keep your square away from all the other objects that are bouncing around the screen.

Early video game programmers worked intensely within constricting limitations to create compelling games that fueled the imagination. In my youth, I spent countless hours fighting enemies which existed more in the mind than were apparent in the pixels on the screen. This was a life lesson of sorts that I’ve learned often translates to real life too.\n\nWith ‘Weapons of Past Distractions’ I wanted to try to capture that feeling in song with a bombastic drum and bass track that pushed the limits of the Atari 2600.\nWith the hardware limitations in mind, I composed the song on a keyboard and wrote the drum parts out on graph paper then translated it note for note in hexadecimal code. Then, using Paul Slocum’s Sequencer Kit, I was able to assemble a working file that I could test out on the Z26 emulator. After some trial and error, and much tweaking, the finished song was sent to the good folks at AtariAge who assembled the cartridges for me from the finest stock.\"","Publisher":"NintendoAge","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nxH_GzHX9Y4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/sounds.burnkit2600.com\/album\/weapons-of-past-distractions"},"200758":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c4d4147d-5e26-4662-be7c-7a38d99f9381.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"2-in-1: Freeway and Tennis"},"201308":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Keystone Kapers","Region":"North America"},{"Name":"Hey!
